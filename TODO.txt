- Data:
x	Need better data:
x		* Only keep alphabetical characters
x		* strip too short texts (because they provide little information)
x		* Add reviews as extra text (Optional)

	Find a way to exclude books from the search space. 
		This avoids having to remove them from the top K results, and losing some information there.
		-> Can be done by subtracting a matrix from the term matrix.

x	Use a fake user on Goodreads with specific genre preference
x		-> Used by leaving out some  books from the user, and then run our algo and see that we find them back.

- Evaluation:
	Compare the 2 possible ways of doing queries
		* 1 query for each book per user
			-> Less costly when a new book is read.
		* Combine text of al books as a single query
			-> Might get more general features
	
	Research Content based evaluation

x LSI: Dimensionality reduction
	-> Probably most useful improvement
	-> Find Best k by trial and error.
