"text": "An accessible and engaging exploration of the mysteries of time   Twenty years ago Stephen Hawking tried to explain time by understanding the Big Bang Now Sean Carroll says we need to be more ambitious One of the leading theoretical physicists of his generation Carroll delivers a dazzling and paradigmshifting theory of times arrow that embraces subjects from entropy to quantum mechanics to time travel to information theory and the meaning of life From Eternity to Here is no less than the next step toward understanding how we came to exist and a fantastically approachable read that will appeal to a broad audience of armchair physicists and anyone who ponders the nature of our world FREE Read through the following dialogue between two people A and B Underline all the sentences which you can imagine saying yourselfA What are you thinkingB Have you ever wondered why the future is different from the pastA What do you mean differentB Well you can remember the past but you cant remember the future WhyA Like dj vuB No not dj vu Really remembering the futureA But the future doesnt exist yet How can you remember something that hasnt happenedB On the other hand the only reason you think the past exists is that you can remember itA Hmm maybe But it would be very confusing to be able to remember the future Youd have no reason to want to do anythingB Its not just memory its everything For example you have photographs of things that have happened in the past but you cant have a photograph of something thats going to happen in the future A But how could you have a photograph of something thats going to happen in the futureB A camera takes pictures of things that happened in the past Why couldnt a futurecamera take pictures of things that happen in the futureA Because you cant It wouldnt workB But why notA What does that book sayB It says we can tell the difference between past and future because were close to the Big BangA Whats that got to do with itB Well its a bit complicated Imagine that the universe stopped expanding after a while and then collapsed againA Is it going to do thatB No it isnt But imagine it did Now would the result look like the Big Bang only backwardsA I dont knowB Well it wouldnt Thats very interesting isnt itA Let me have a look myself Hm hm hm so hes got this theory about baby universes that he developed with someone called Jennifer Chen Whats a baby universeB Ah first you have to imagine that our own universe continues for several zillion yearsA Wait he dedicated the book to Jennifer To Jennifer for all time So he developed this weird theory with his girlfriend Thats so romanticB It might be a different Jennifer Let me google itA It cant be B Oh it is His wifes also called Jennifer Just a coincidenceA How

difference between left and right forward and backward up and down However for us there is a substantive difference between up and down because we live in the spatial vicinity of a massive object  the earth  which exerts a gravitational pull on usAnd in spacetime there should be no material difference between past and future But for us there is a substantive difference because we live in the temporal vicinity of a massive event  the Big Bang  which gave rise to the arrow of timeOr so Sean Carroll argues in From Eternity to Here The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time He says that the reason we remember the past and not the future the reason effects always follow causes and never vice versa the reason we perceive time always moving in a particular direction is because of entropy For whatever reason physicists collectively shrug their shoulders the Big Bang was an extremely lowentropy event and ever since entropy has been increasing and pulling the arrow of time with it Even if the arrow were to somehow reverse and run time backwards supposedly we would still remember the lowentropy direction as the past and feel we were moving toward the highentropy futureEntropy itself is an interesting concept one that most of us are taught in high school physics class is synonymous with disorder But thats not really what it is  entropy measures the number of microstates corresponding to each macrostate Basically the more possible configurations of all the particles within a substance the higher the entropy and the more likely the substance is to eventually reach that state After all there are many more ways egg molecules can be situated in an omelet than in an unbroken egg where all the yolk molecules must cluster together and the albumin and the shell and so forth Its just statistics that any given egg is likely to end up in the highentropy condition And another name for these statistics is the Second Law of ThermodynamicsSince everything is far more likely to be in a highentropy condition than a low one it remains a mystery why the universe currently has relatively low entropy and apparently had even less in the past Yet that seems to be the case and so we need the Past Hypothesis when considering the past we ignore the statisticallypreferred highentropy condition and assume that the closer we get in time to the Big Bang the more the entropy decreasesWhy Well thats the question the book grapples with because nobody has the faintest clueCarroll scoffs at popular concepts like the anthropic principle irreversible temporal systems and a symmetrical entropydecreasing Big Crunch as irrelevant or inadequate to explain the mystery Instead hes fond of the idea of baby universes spawned spontaneously from the maximalentropy atomic soup of impossibly ancient dead universes The creation of the baby would have properties similar to the Big Bang  inflation expansion low entropy an arrow of time and so on Maybe the reason we observe such crazily low levels of entropy is because our universe is just a toddlerAdmittedly this is a cool idea but its not really science Its not remotely empirical testable or falsifiable which Carroll freely admits And veering off into crazy metaphysical theories is fun and all but I mean we could all be brains in jars too or the elaborate fever dream of some minor god Who knowsI enjoyed this book though Its explanation of quantum mechanics was far more lucid and understandable than anything Id read previously  and it uses cats but more entertainingly and humanely than Schrdinger did Its speculations on time travel and wormholes and multiple universes gave my inner sci fi geek plenty to chew on And it introduced me to the concept of Boltzmann brains which was worth the price of admission in and of itselfBut mostly I just found Carrolls writing to be clear funny and affecting As an example the following paragraph which encapsulates everything I consider beautiful and fulfilling about scienceWe find ourselves not as a central player in the life of the cosmos but as a tiny epiphenomenon flourishing for a brief moment as we ride a wave of increasing entropy from the Big Bang to the quiet emptiness of the future universe Purpose and meaning are not to be found in the laws of nature or in the plans of any external agent who made things that way it is our job to create them One of those purposes  among many  stems from our urge to explain the world around us the best we can If our lives are brief and undirected at least we can take pride in our mutual courage as we struggle to understand things much greater than ourselves   This is a very wellwritten and entertaining book on our understanding of the arrow of time Entropy is a key concept which deserves and gets lots of attention The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system entropy can either stay the same or increaseit cannot decrease Sean Carroll shows why the reversibility of physics at the particle level gives rise to a seeming paradox if the physics of particles is just as correct with time switched backwards why cant entropy decrease Carroll discusses this issue at lengthI have often wondered if the universe were to start contracting at some point for example if dark energy did not exist causing inflation to accelerate wouldnt entropy start decreasing then Just as I was getting annoyed that the answer wasnt forthcoming Carroll started addressing this very issue He explained that a calculation of entropy requires including gravitational fields especially in the realms of lumpy matter For example the single supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy contains more entropy than all of the rest of the universe combined excluding other black holesToward the end of the book Carroll starts to wander into speculation he clearly states that his opinion is a minority opinion but that it is just as well supported as other ideas The central question that he raises is this if the entropy of the universe is still relatively low but always increases then at an earlier stage the entropy of the universe must have been much much lower still So how did the entropy get that way so very very low compared to what it would be if the universe were in equilibrium It is a very important question in cosmology but I wont spoil your reading by giving away the answer here Read the book and discover a truly interesting but highly speculative explanation of this conundrum    If I could I would give  stars to the first half of this book and  to the second For the first  pages or so in the iBook version I was enthralled by Carrolls exceptional ability to lay down the fundamentals of physics and cosmology in clear straightforward language with simple but highly effective illustrations This book has by far the best description of general relativity especially the equivalence principle for the nonphysicist that I have ever encountered His explanation of dark matter and vacuum energy is also brilliantI was all mixed up on those concepts before I read this book but now I feel I have at least some clarity though in reality Im probably as confused as ever I also loved the discussion on black holes white holes and Hawkings black hole radiation The chapter on quantum mechanics the collapse of the quantum wave function and the wave function of the universe is this stuff for real and Miss Kitty is also superb However the book isnt really meant to be an introduction to the fundamentals of physics and cosmology It is about the arrow of time ie why we experience time as flowing from past to present to future and the authors view that it connects not only to the origin of our universe but to a much broader cosmology Were talking multiverses baby universes and all sorts of other wild visions here Carroll believes that they key to understanding time the universe and everything isentropy I would try to summarize entropy here but quite honestly Im now terrified at the thought Carroll spends about  of the book explaining and reexplaining it It all started with some engineers in the th century who were determined to build more effective steam engines But in this book entropys reach extends far far FAR beyond that And whether you are convinced by Carrolls application of entropythermodynamics will determine your final views on this bookIn the end I wasnt totally convinced Entropy is a slippery fuzzy statistical concept and it seemed to me that Carroll had no trouble defining and redefining it on a whim to suit his argument At times this practice has completely ridiculous and nonsensical consequences Boltzmann brains for instance which the author seems to believe are out there And I felt that Carroll spent way too much time chasing down dead ends seemingly for its own sake I did however find the end gameonce we finally got thereto be really intriguing and imaginative It will be interesting to see if his modelof our universe being one of many baby universes that bubbled up from an infinite static highentropy background universeis ever backed up by real data What is it they like to say in physics Shut up and calculate    This is a very good book about some fundamental modern physics concepts such as arrow of time entropy symmetry timereversibility complexity theory of information and their complex interrelationships I found that this book has one of the best explanations of entropy for the layman and the treatment of potentially complex areas such as symmetry quantum mechanics and relativity is very good  deeper than in most popular science books Overall a very enjoyable read which would appeal to a wide audience from the mathematically challenged as maths is very minimal to individuals looking for a deeper treatment of modern physics than what found in most popular science booksJust a couple of areas where I found areas for improvement  in the treatment of quantum mechanics the collapse of the wave function is correctly regarded by the author as a potential problem of the socalled Copenhagen interpretation this is correct but there are other interpretations in particular the DeBroglieBohm theory that overcome this problem yes they are nonlocal but the author himself actually tends to agree with the nonlocality position of this and similar approaches  so a even brief mention of these alternatives would have made the book much more complete  whilst the concept of symmetry is very nicely illustrated and explained unfortunately the very important concept of symmetrybreaking is not explained  which I think is baffling in a book which is supposed to deal with time reversibility and the arrow of time Apart from these minor points a very enjoyable and rewarding read    "},

meaning of life in a dream at  then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes I knew this to be trueand yet I have always felt a need to search for the truth that nebulous illtreated creature Adams has always been to me to be a welcome companion in that journey Between the search for meaning and the recognition that its all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams and luckily for us he doesnt seem to mind if you lie there with him Hes a tall guy but hell make roomFor all his crazed unpredictability Adams is a powerful rationalist His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted It turns out it takes little more than a moments questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonableIt is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams quips and absurdities His approach is much more personable and less embittered than Dawkins which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism which is a polite was of saying atheismReading his books its not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who cant even recognize when a point has actually been made Adams humanism however stretched much further than the contention between those who believe and those who dontWe see it from his protagonists who are not elitist intellectualstheyre not even especially brightbut damn it theyre trying By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be trueIts all a joke its all ridiculous The absurdists might find this depressing but theyre just a bunch of narcissists anyhow Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis attractive people in bathing suits and Eulers Identity I say lets sit down at the bar with the rabbi the priest and the frog and try to get a song going Or at least recognize that its okay to laugh at ourselves now and again Its not the end of the worldIts just is a joke but some of us are in on it   In my experience readers either love Adams books or quickly put them down I for example quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page and have read the Hitchhikers Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized But both my wife and father couldnt get past book one the former because she found it too silly and the latter because he found the writing to be more about the authors personality than plot and character WhateverThe first three books in the Hitchhikers TrilogyThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy The Restaurant at the End of the Universe and Life the Universe and Everythingare inspired lunacy The ideas plots puns jokes and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers but people from all fields For instance the Babel Fish software that translates foreign websites for you is named after a species of fish that Adams created in book one you can find dozens of recipes online for PanGalactic Gargle Blasters the chess computer Deep Thought that lost two matches to Gary Kasparov in  was named after a computer in book one and seriously who hasnt heard that the answer to life the universe and everything is  For more of these consult wikipediaorgs entry on The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References Chances are if youre reading these books for the first time youll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams creationsThe books arent of course without their problems Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had and I paraphrase a long beginning a long conclusion and not much in the middle though I cant remember where I read that He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out oneliners The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics Despite this the Hitchhikers Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books Ive ever reada position theyve occupied for some fifteen years Adams wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly consistently make me howl with laughter the other being Terry Pratchett Readers beware if the Adams

impromptu giftgiving than I feel I have accomplished something I only did this because I had a collection of funny pics and couldnt figure out what else to do with them so I bootstrapped them in to a review I care stars   Please before anything DONT PANICThis review is I think that one of the things that one has to keep in mind while reading this book is that it was written in  Having this important factor in perspective its quite astonishing the vision of Douglas Adams the author presenting a lot of visionary elements starting with the very book inside the book I mean The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy since its presented as an electronic book which now its a very common way to read a lot of books now Also he mentioned stuff like touchsensitive screens that yet again its now something introduced in our daily lives ScienceFiction the good science fiction is defined by being visionary in the moment to be published and a fact years later Just like Vernes work predicting events like space rockets and nuclear submarines  Obviously beside the mesmering tecnology stuff that he predicted the signature style here is his remarkable sense of humor SMART sense of humor In literature and pop culture in general there were been unforgettable examples of computers like the cold HAL from  A Space Odyssey and the noble KITT from Knight Rider also robots like the loyal RD from Star Wars and the logical robots from I Robot short story collection However nothing of that can prepare you to the experience of meeting Eddie the Main Computer of the Heart of Gold spaceship or Marvin the Paranoid Android This is one of the best traits of Douglas Adams wit in the development of artificial intelligence I wasnt surprised since some months ago I read Shada by Gareth Roberts but based on the Doctor Whos unaired script written by Douglas Adams where you find another priceless example of a computer with a personality that only Adams is able to develop You laugh and laugh with them BUT not only because theys funny but also they are truly logical as artifical intelligences in their way to react to situations Adams impact of how presenting artificial intelligence can be found too in another novel of Doctor Who Festival of Death by Jonathan Morris where the author showed how well he learned Adams lessons  I believe that Douglas Adams involvement in the production of the iconic British scifi TV series Doctor Who as script editor and writer of three stories it was fated since I found remarkable similarities on the premises of both works this novel and the TV series Both has a peculiar fellow who stole certain machine and along with companions is travelling around So it wouldnt a surprise that he got some inspiration since Doctor Who was widely known since  specially on its native country England Of course his participation on another British TV institution like Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a relevant point for Adams to explode his humoristic potential  Its possible that people unfamiliar with Adams work could think that since this is a novel with comedy they could think that it cant be a serious sciencefiction book However the brilliance of this novel is its capacity of offering smart humor while using scientific concepts like the theory of fasterthanlight objects Even you wont be able to fight against his priceless explanation behind the UFOs sightingsWithout spoiling anything I think that my only reason of getting off a star in my rating of this great novel was its lacking a proper closure I understand that this the first book in a trilogy of five books yes you read correctly it wasnt a mistake so the adventures and mysteries will continue in the second book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe However it was quite unsettling when you are having the time of your life reading it and the book just stopped to have words I describe it like that since I didnt feel an ending It was indeed just like the impossibility of not finding more words in the book What I can give to Adams is that that was quite improbable but in my opinion quite unlikely way to just ending this book Certainly I want to read the rest of this great    of    books Yes yet again you read well and it isnt a mistake   This is not the best book ever written It is unlikely to affect you on any deep emotional level and you probably wont spend sleepless nights just thinking about itBut its a simple humourous scifi adventure It wont do something for everybody but Im a massive fan of Douglas Adams and his sense of humour Come on like it or not Adams has some awesomely quotable sayings not all of these are from this exact book   "},

"text": "Kerouacs classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be Beat and has inspired every generation since its initial publication This is probably the worst book I have ever finished and Im forever indebted to the deeply personalitydisordered college professor who assigned it because if it hadnt been for that class I never wouldve gotten through and I gotta tell you this is the book I love to hateI deeply cherish but dont know that I fully agree with Truman Capotes assessment that On the Road is not writing at all  its typingLovely Turman but lets be clear typing by itself is fairly innocuous  this book is so awful its actually offensive and even incredibly damagingId be lying if I said there arent parts of this book thatre so bad theyre good  good as in morbidly fascinating in the manner of advancedstage syphilis slides from seventhgrade health class Keroacs ode to the sadeyed Negro is actually an incredible incredible example of something Im glad has been typed For the record So we can all see it clearly and KNOWPlease dont get me wrong My disproportionately massive loathing for Jack Kerouac has zero to do with his unenlightened racial views I mean it was written in the fifties and anyway its great that he was able to articulate these ideas so honestly No the real reason I hate this book so much is that it established a deeply retarded model of EuropeanAmerican male coolness that continues to plague our culture todayI could go into a lot more depth on this topic but its come to my attention that Ive been using my horrible addiction to Bookster to avoid the many obligations and responsiblities of my daily life to which I should now return So in closing this book SUCKS This book is UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE And for that very reason especially considering its serious and detrimental impact on western civilization I definitely recommend that you read it if you have not suffered that grave misfortune already   Im supposed to like On the Road right Well I dont I hate it and I always have There are a lot of reasons why I hate it I find Kerouacs attitude toward the world pathetically limited and paternalistic In    he actually muses about how much he wishes that he could have been born a Negro in the antebellum South living a simple life free from worry and does so seemingly without any sense of irony On every page the book is about how Kerouac a young white middleclass solipsistic alcoholic feels and nothing more But thats only one reason I hate this book The main reason I hate it is because for me reading Kerouacs prose is almost physically painful I love the ramblings of selfcentered drunks when theyre selfdeprecating ironic andor funny but Kerouac was none of these things He was a pretentious selfimportant bore who produced some of the most painfully bad and inconsequential prose of the th century Or any century   A View from the CouchOTR has received some negative reviews lately so I thought I would try to explain my ratingThis novel deserves to lounge around in a five star hotel rather than languish in a lone star saloonDisclaimerPlease forgive my review It is early morning and I have just woken up with a sore head an empty bed and a full bladderConfesssionLet me begin with a confession that dearly wants to become an assertionI probably read this book before most of you were bornSo thereWouldnt you love to say thatIf only I had the courage of my convictionsInstead I have only convictions and they are many and variedHowever I am sure that by the end of my this sentence I shall be releasedElevated to the BarI read OTR in my teens which were spread all over the end of the s and the beginning of the sMy life was dominated by Scouting for BoysI mean the book not the activityMy mantra was be prepared although at the time I didnt realise that this actually meant be prepared for warAfter reading OTR my new mantra was be inebriatedMind you I had no idea what alcohol tasted like but it sounded goodGone were two boys in a tent and three men in a boatOTR was about trying to get four beats in a bar no matter how far youd travelled that dayTyping or WritingForget whether it was just typing rather than writingThat was just Truman Capote trying to dot one of Dorothy Parkers eyesThis is like focusing on the mince instead of the sausageAll Drums and SymbolsYou have to appreciate what OTR symbolised for people like meIt was On the Road not In the House or In the BurbsIt was about dynamism not passivityIt wasnt about a stream of consciousness it was about a river of activityIt was about white light white heat not white picket fencesSavouring the SausageOK your impressions are probably more recent than mineMine are memories that have been influenced by years of indulgence I do maintain that alcohol kills the unhealthy brain cells first so it is actually purifying your brainI simply ask that you overlook the mince and savour the sausageBeyond EphemeralityI would like to make one last parting metaphorI have misappropriated it from the musician Dave GraneyHe talks about feeling ephemeral but looking eternalDave comes from the Church of the Latter Day HipstersHe is way cooler than me he even looks great in leather pants in a spivvy kinda wayHowever I think the point he was making if not then the point I am making is that most of life is ephemeral It just happens and its gone foreverHowever in Daves case the way he looks the way he feels he turns it into something eternalIts his art his music our pleasure our memories at least until we dieFootnotes on CoolCreativity and style are our last chance attempt to defy ephemerality and mortality and become eternalYes all that stuff between the bookends of OTR might be typing it might be preserving ephemerality that wasnt worthy or deservingHowever the point is the attempt to be your own personal version of coolHeck no way am I cool like the Beats or James Dean or Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholson or Clint Eastwood or Keith Richards or Camille PagliaHowever I am trying to live life beyond the ephemeralThats what OTR means to me If it doesnt mean that to you hey thats alright Im OK youre OK Its coolOriginal posted March     Ive been thinking about this book a lot lately so I figured that Id go back and write something about it When I first read this book I loved it as a piece of art but its effect on me was different than I expected So many people hail Kerouac as the artist who made them quit their jobs and go to the road become a hippie or a beat and give up the rest When I read it though I had been completely obsessed with hippie culture for a long time and it caused me to steer away from it for a while While I thought that it would be a rollicking tale of freedom and glory I found that all of Deans conquests were tainted by the fact that he had to take advantage of other people every step of the way He was a hugely entertaining character but would have been a terrible friend lover or even acquaintance From the women he married to gas station attendents right down to Sal Paradise himself Dean drained everything that he was right out of other people and it eventually ruined him It left him beatnot heart beating exhilarated but beat up dead beat and alone Once I stepped back a little from the awe at Deans greatness this book was really sad and it caused me to put away that romanticism for a whileNow  years later though On the Road is coming back to me full on I didnt escape the total wonder at the Beats and the road I have been on the road myself for the last  months and have a long way to go before I get back home and I am constantly aware that the the way was paved by Kerouac and the rest of the crazy geniuses of his generation The road is every bit as romantic as Sal Paradise made it out to be and its glory far out weighs the short comings of Dean as a friend I mean the road is a lot like Dean it takes a lot out of you but you get addicted to it and obsessed with it and cant let it go and I dont think theres any other way about it I am in love with America for the first time Now that Ive seen it driven across and up and down around and over America I find it sublime and incredible I think that Kerouac and his friends mightve been the first to see that Maybe not Maybe they are just part of all of American historythey translated the world of Western expansion and canvas covered wagons into the way of the modern world America is something to dream about It is worthy every exuberant and formerly offensive Im proud sticker thats plastered on the back of a pick up truck And Kerouac saw that first hand So it seems that there is a certain tragedy in this book but that it is less important than the unavoidable glory that you come to associate with the road and freedom after following these guys on their crazy adventure I think this book should be read by everyone who wants to know about America   This is the book which has given me anxiety attacks on sleepless nightsThis is the book which has glared at me from its high pedestal of classical importance in an effort to browbeat me into finally finishing it And this is that book which has shamed me into feigning an air of ignorance every time I browsed any of the countless bookstoreadbeforeyoudie listsYes Jack Kerouac you have tormented me for the past  years and every day I couldnt summon the strength to open another page of On the Road and subject my brain to the alltoofamiliar torture of Sals sleepinducing infuriatingly monotonous narration Finally I conquer you after nearly  years of dithering I am the victorious one in the battle in which you have relentlessly assaulted my finer senses with your crassness and innate insipidity and dared me to plod on I can finally beat my chest in triumph ugh pardon the Tarzanish metaphor but a star review deserves no better and announce to the world that I have finished reading On the Road Oh what an achievement And what a monumental waste of my timeDear Beat Generation classic I can finally state without any fear of being called out on my ignorance that I absolutely hated reading you Every moment of it Alternatively this book can be named White Heterosexual Mans Misadventures and Chauvinistic Musings And even that makes it sound much more interesting and less offensive than it actually is In terms of geographical sweep the narrative covers nearly the whole of America in the s weaving its way in and out of Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco and many other major American cities Through the eyes of Salvatore Sal Paradise a professional bum we are given an extended peek into the lives of a band of merry havenots their hapless trysts with women booze drugs homelessness destitution jazz as they hitchhike and motor their way through the heart of America Sounds fascinating right Ayn Rand will vehemently disagree though But no its anything but that Instead this one just shoves Jack Kerouacs internalized white superiority sexism and homophobia right in the readers face in the form of some truly bad writing This book might as well come with a caption warning any potential reader who isnt White or male or straight I understand that this was written way before it became politically incorrect to portray women in such a poor light or wistfully contemplate living a Negros life in the antebellum South But theres an obvious limit to the amount of his vile ruminations I can tolerate  Seriously Godblessed patience Every female character in this one is a vague silhouette or a caricature of a proper human being Marylou Camille Terry Galatea are all frighteningly onedimensional  they never come alive for the reader through Sals myopic vision They are merely there as inanimate props reduced to the status of languishing in the background and occasionally allowed to be in the limelight when the men begin referring to them as if they were objectsEither they are whores for being as sexually liberated as the men are or they are screaming wives who throw their husbands out of the house for being jobless cheating drunks or they are opportunistic and evil simply because they do not find Sal or Dean or Remy or Ed or any of the men in their lives to be deserving of their trust and respect which they truly arentAnd sometimes they are only worthy of only a one or twoline description like the following  Look at Sal talking about a woman as if she were a breed of cat he wanted to rescue from the animal shelter    Is Marylou a wrench or a machine of some kind And this is not to mention the countless instances of get you a girl get girls Lets get a girl and other minor variations of the same strewn throughout the length of the book and some of Sals thoughts about queers which are equally revolting Maybe I am too much of a nonAmerican with no ties to a real person who sees the Beat era through the lenses of pure nostalgia or maybe I am simply incapable of appreciating the themes of youthful wanderlust and living life with a perverse aimlessness or maybe its the flat writing and appalling representation of women Whatever the real reasons maybe I can state with conviction that this is the only American classic which I tried to the best of my abilities to appreciate but failed   "},

the book is by turns passionate political funny and harrowing It is also a journey into that greatest of uncharted landsthe wilderness of the mindand Griffiths beautifully explores the language and symbolism that shape our experience of our own wildness  Part travelogue part manifesto for wildness as an essential character of life Wild is a oneofakind book from a oneofakind author It took me long to actually realise what this book was about it is actually a travel book full of wandering on language history environmental issues etc often with a focus on nonurbanized wild people such as Amazonian tribes and Eskimo huntersThe best thing about it is the language Jay Griffiths can write as well as any writer Ive ever come across Just see how she describes the life in the coral reefs its poetry in prose a symphony in wordsAs for the actual content she makes a strong case for the need of our society to revalue the importance of wildness and challenges the wide held notion of the cultural and moral superiority of western modern society over traditional cultures eg aboriginal hunter gatherers Though she doesnt lack neither facts nor linguistic prowess to make her case and while personally sharing both her environmental concerns and her adversion to Christian religion she partly ruins it by portraying wild people as the good guys and civilised invaders as the bad usually in a judgemental way with no room for nuance or doubt I think this is not so much an antidote to the utterly negative view long held and still held by western society towards other cultures but rather an overraction to it that will please only those readers who already share her point of viewAt times her reasoning is quite poor For instance while rightly denouncing the derogatory meaning of some terms in the English language commonly applied to wild nondomesticated plant and animal species such as weed or pest she then tries to support her view of the Inuit as an environmentally wiser people since their language has no word for either pest or vermin or weed  a fact that indicates little or nothing being merely a reflection of the Inuit being hunter gatherers and most importantly of being almost no flora at all where they live When she denounces the intolerance of the missionary in West Papua and their complicity with the Indonesia military that every year kill innocent people she then asserts that before this the natives only killed for reasonable reasons such as rituals  should we conclude that killing for one religion is wrong but killing for another is not Or again when she seeks to demonstrate the innate kindness of nature and precivilization humans through an etymological analysis of the word kind  didnt realize that the etymology of a word can alone be evidence of how our ancestors behavedI insist on the drawbacks rather than the virtues of this book because I believe it really had the potential of being a masterpiece if only the author had not been so wildly blackandwhite Perhaps this raw at times unreasonable passion is part of what makes this book so fascinating but upon reflection I must consider it its greatest limit The lack of a coherent narrative structure makes it easy to read at small bites like on a short bus ride but on the other hand may give you the headache if you try to follow it for more than  minutesThis book could have been something truly special It isntwsa   Ive never read a book quite like this its very difficult to describe Seven years in the writing like some mythical heros trials its a hymn to the wild written by a young poet anthropologist philosopher adventurer and probably manic depressive too Its divided into sections for each element Earth Ice an element on its own Water Fire and Air and Griffiths travels the globe in search of unspoiled wildness the Amazon the Arctic Indonesia Australia and West Papua with a brief epilogue in Outer Mongolia It might seem overdone in places but there is some wonderful sweeping poetry and passionate advocacy of the rights of savages as well as epic rage against suburbia Christianity and golf courses among other thingsThe language itself is wild and anarchic although she is wonderful on the etymology of words drawing all sorts of intriguing connections On the enclosure of land in Australia for example Fence means not only boundary but also the keeper of stolen goods and settlers stealing the land fenced it before they did anything elseHer bibliography is staggeringly eclectic and erudite she quotes the Bible Rousseau Francis Bacon Conrad and Flanders and Swann with equal facility Yet despite her erudition she can become fully absorbed by wild cultures getting stoned with shamans in Peru going out with whale hunters in Alaska or struggling through mountains and swamps in West Papua with local guides whom she feels more at home with than the obnoxioussounding anthropologist who is her companionI took seven years over this work spent all I had my time money and energy Part of the journey was a green riot and part a deathly bleakness I got ill I got well  I got to the point of collapse I got the giggles I met cannibals infinitely kinder and more trustworthy than the murderous missionaries who evangelize them  I found a paradox of wildness in the glinting softness of its charisma for what is savage is in the deepest sense gentle and what is wild is kind   Ive just recently finished reading this book  after eight months I really laboured through it and only finished it because I dont like starting a book and not finishing it It came highly recommended by someone I admire but I have a few quibbles with itJay writes exquisitely which I truly admire and envy her for She is also extremely brave and adventurous for having tackled places and situations that she writes about I also share many of her views on wildness What irked me was her selfrighteous tone at times I did find her preachy and often inconsistent and offensive in her viewsShe does unilaterally dismiss all western white people as being in the wrong and all primitiveie victims of the white westerners and untainted by civilizationpeople and their cultures as right Of course there was a lot of wrong done in the name of civilization and turning people to Christianity but there must have been a lot of good people among them too Likewise I dont believe for a moment that the primitive people are not capable of their own atrocities tooShe comes across as prowomen but she does admit that she feels more comfortable in the presence of men and her description of the people in West Papua does point to chauvinist behaviour When a child dies in that society it is womensears or finger tips that are chopped off and not mens She writes eloquently of being allowed as an honorary man to sit with the men in their hut at night while they smoked but Id like to ask why the women in that society are excluded from such gatherings Isnt it reminiscent of men only clubs in the western world or of Victorian times when women used to beat a hasty retreat after dinner to leave the men to their port and cigarsAnother point is her bashing of Christianity Each to their own and all that but would she have got away if she wrote like this about the Jewish faith or Islam A little respect for other belief systems whether you agree with them or not would not have detracted from the value of the bookAt the end she describes her heartbreak very movingly but then goes on to say that after a period  a few weeks  its time to thrive and start living again as nature does Well good for her but for some people it takes longer than others to recover from tragic events and some dont recover at all Are such people less than othersA great author but a little humility would not hurt    While I enjoyed the stories of her global travels and descriptions of other cultures and customs I was intensely repelled by Ms Griffiths obvious deepseated hatred for so many things especially white people and western civilization Ms Griffiths has a way with words and can weave beautiful poetic images yet often resorts to crude slang If you enjoy odd philosophical meanderings and radical ideologies pseudointellectual ecosocialism and scathing attacks on the moralism and ethics of anyone who isnt a loinclothgird savage this book is for you   If you only have time for one sentence hear this Jay Griffiths book Wild is one of the most powerful books Ive ever read Wild is a celebration of wildness and freedom It celebrates societies that work societies that have complete respect for their ecosystems societies that have survived for thousands of years without suffering destructive whirlwinds of mass hysteriaGriffiths is a brilliant heretic and a proud one Her book shows us what happens when madness collides with wildness It helps us understand the dark injuries that destroyed our own freedom and put us on the path to what we have become It is  pages of fullthrottle outsidethebox thinking written with passion and eloquence For outsidethebox thinkers its just awesome For light sleepers it might provide a lifechanging wakeup call Griffiths was born in deepest darkest England a devastated island that was once a magnificent rainforest She was blessed with the precious curse and gift of having an active mind She excelled at asking penetrating questions that were not proper for young ladies or lads to ask The wardens were not amusedDuring her teen years she hung out with fundamentalist Christians but what they were teaching could not survive rational scrutiny and her mind was highly allergic to blind faith Painful clashes inspired her to run away She abandoned the normal life for which she had been trained I lost a walled city but found a wildness and freedom I never regretted itShe wandered around the world but life was not always easy Following a passionate freedom can mean loneliness penury humiliation for we live in a world where the caged hate the free By and by she floated away into a healthy dance with depression Depression is one of lifes valuable idiot lights warning us that its time to pay attention and alter our courseOne day the phone rang and a friend invited her to Peru where she could hang out with shamans use powerful medicine and recover her lost soul So she did and it worked The heavy black clouds soon dispersed She spent the next seven years working on her book travelling from the Amazon to New Guinea Australia and Arctic CanadaWe routinely teach our children that wild people are primitive and that their way of life is inferior and undesirable In so doing we erect a brick wall that prohibits fresh wild notions from flushing the crud out of our wheezing slobbering imaginations Instead we teach our children to live like theres no tomorrow to shop till you drop to leave nothing behind for future generationsGriffiths understands that the brick wall must be smashed for the sake of all life Her mind is a sledgehammer She takes us on visits to wild ecosystems that stood in the path of the alldevouring global economy She listened to the wild people in a caring and respectful manner hearing their pain rage and despair They had a healthy way of life before the invasion They needed nothing from us They simply wanted to be left alone She took long treks through the jungle with wild people who possessed immense knowledge of the plants and animals They perceived that all flora and fauna have spirits except for domesticated plants They saw that all wild beings were animated by the same life force but different species appeared in different forms We were all equal When humans lived like equals rather than masters they didnt gang rape their ecosystem because that would have been inconceivable After days of hiking through a perfectly healthy land a treasure of abundant life they stumbled upon the town of Maldonado the cash economy the modern world  electric lights pop music abundant booze and drugs discarded syringes splatters of puke and overflowing outhouses Everyone seemed to be mad To me the forest had been wildly beautiful and the town was a hideous wastelandOne chapter was devoted to the vast wildness of the sea the place where all life began The surface of Mars is better known to us than the floor of our oceans The underwater world is a realm of immense beauty and diversity Cetaceans like whales and dolphins are incredibly intelligent and they live in an incredibly intelligent manner exactly as evolution prepared them to live wild and free without technology a brilliant strategy for longterm successThe ocean is a place where primates have little business beyond the shoreline Civilized primates have become abusive ravaging the sea life and filling the waters with toxins sewage garbage and noise Climate change is making the oceans so acidic that catastrophic harm now seems very likely Wild people didnt do this  even when they lived too hard the harm they caused was far far less than the harm caused by our way of lifeMissionaries were high on the list of people that Griffiths most resented because their mission was to destroy wild cultures and convert wild people into literate employed Christian consumers In Peru four different missionary groups using helicopters and speed boats competed to find uncontacted tribes They knew that they would import deadly diseases but they didnt care In some places half of the people died within two years of their arrival The priests blamed female shamans for the illness and the angry people killed the shamansCommon gifts for the converts included axes tobacco clothing and mirrors Mirrors enabled people to see their own faces and become more aware of their individuality Jesus saved individuals not communities God lived in heaven and the Earth was a realm of wickedness so it didnt matter it was worthless Missionaries built roads into the jungle which were soon used by miners loggers and other destroyers Separated from the family of life the modern heart gets hardMissionaries forced the natives to surrender their sacred objects which they burned Within two generations traditional knowledge becomes extinct because it is no longer being passed down to the young who spend their days in classrooms Cultural genocide is emotionally shattering In one Brazilian tribe over  natives committed suicideIn Australia the invasion of civilization has been devastating for the Aborigines and their home but the elders maintain a sense of patience for the noxious cities are nothing more than ugly scabs Whites have never possessed the spirit of the land which remains alive beneath the parking lots and shopping centers With time the disease will pass the land will heal and thrive once again to the best of its abilityHumans are not domesticated we are genetically wild animals but so many have been tamed Tamed creatures are doltminded and dumb insipid and bland Griffiths tells us The tame are trained only to hear the voice of their tamer having ears only for command Our wild genes scream in despair as we go berserk with cage rage Sensible habits and good road safety skills will keep you alive till eighty So what If you didnt know freedom you never livedThe myth of human superiority has constructed an enormous ecocidal monstrosity and its ongoing selfdestruction will result in unimaginable harm If we cannot find a way to return to our humble place in the family of life we will have no future Thats the message here   "},

"author": "Jon Krakauer",
"text": "What would possess a gifted young man recently graduated from college to literally walk away from his life Noted outdoor writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer tackles that question in his reporting on Chris McCandless whose emaciated body was found in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness in  Described by friends and relatives as smart literate compassionate and funny did McCandless simply read too much Thoreau and Jack London and lose sight of the dangers of heading into the wilderness alone Krakauer whose own adventures have taken him to the perilous heights of Everest provides some answers by exploring the pull the outdoors seductive yet often dangerous has had on his own life This book is a wonderful cautionary tale I will probably read it again with my daughter when she is old enough to discuss it Unfortunately Im afraid the reason most people will read the book and see the new upcoming movie is for a different reason Chris McCandless in the book and from what I understand in the movie is a hero and courageous for flying in the face of everything he grew up with to find a better way A young man unhappy with the materialism hunger and waste in the world angry with his father for not being a perfect father to him intellectually superior a fantastic athlete in top condition and yet a young man who died because of his own decisions and his own actions He cut off ties to his family hitchhiked and worked his way to Alaska headed into the wild in April  and was found dead in August  most probably from starvation How wonderful to fight against the odds and ask real questions Unfortunately Chris didnt really fight against any odds he took the easy way out by cutting off real relationships Chris may have asked real questions but he denied real people the opportunity to answer them in any way because he had already decided what was the right way This is not heroic It is immaturity It is tragic and sad yes but not heroic or courageousAfter reading the book I think Chris died because he was foolish Intellectually bright yes Athletically gifted yes But he had no wisdom Wisdom has been defined as skill in living and wisdom is not always bestowed on the young and the healthy and the intellectually smart The opposite of wisdom is foolishness His anger and questioning drove him not to wisdom but to selfreliance and an overweening arrogance in his own ability to get through it Well we see the result of those decisions and those attitudes to quote Darwin Chris is an example of how survival of the fittest applies Chris was not fit therefore he did not survive But why wasnt he fit He was smart and young and gifted in many ways but he chose to abandon relationships and abandon those who loved him and create himself anew with no relationships and no ties He walked away from people who loved him made friends with people who came to love him and walked away from all of that to find his answers in the wild on his own The way away from love and relationship leads not to life but indeed to death And death is what Chris gotThe book quotes Chris mother as saying I havent prayed since we lost him pg  An older man who befriended Chris Ronald Franz also says When Alex left for Alaska I prayed I asked God to keep his finger on the shoulder of that one I told him that boy was special But he let Alex die So on December  when I learned what had happened I renounced the Lord I withdrew my church membership and became an atheist I decided I couldnt believe in a God who would let something that terrible happen to a boy like Alex pg  But God didnt do anything to Chris except let him do as he wanted If Chris sought real answers to his hard questions God is there and God can help but you have to know you need help and submit to someone wiser than you Chris McCandless never submitted willingly to anyone and he certainly never admitted anyone else had teaching or wisdom for him He was smarter than everyone else better able to see the truth than anyone else So the heritage Chris McCandless left is one that drives his mother to stop praying and converts an old man to atheism Is this the heritage anyone would wantSo read this book but read it with questions in mind Why are we lauding a young man as a hero who was actually a foolish man What kind of society are we in where real courage and real heroism are somehow playing nd fiddle to selfishness and arrogance When are you so intellectually intelligent that you become stupid Is there any time when foolish decisions could be called courageous In a search for truth and what really matters in life is it acceptable to think nothing of hurting those people who are most vulnerable to you When you die will the way you lived your life cause others to abandon their faith or grow in their faith Is it ever courageous to be selfish and think only of yourself Is it harder to walk away from a relationship or to stay in a relationship and work on making it better Would you ever teach anyone else that the way to have real relationships is to limit yourself only to those people who cannot ever hurt youReal courage real heroism comes when you love others and you serve others Real courage has nothing selfish in it Fathers and husbands who remain with their families and provide for them even though they would rather have a midlife crisis and leave it all they are courageous and heroic They remain they work they dont father or husband perfectly but they remain in difficult relationships It courageous to stay in the hard parts of life and try Mothers and wives who sacrifice and serve again and again and again without books being written about them without thanks but who continue to love and give of themselves to others That is courageous It is hard to stay in messy relationships It is easy to leave It is courageous to stay and do hard things It is easy to leave and do what you wantSo lets read this book but read it as a cautionary tale This is what happens when you seemingly have it all but have not love When you die will people be driven to become atheists Will people stop praying when you are dead Or will you live a life of wisdom and love Will you leave behind you a heritage of godly love and service Will people pray more because of the example you left them Will they be more loving better mothers or fathers or sisters or brothers Or will they become angry and arrogant and foolishness Yes this is a good book to read But lets read it for the right reasons and with the right questionsNOTE In the book and in the movie the author proposes that Chris ate some poison berries which caused his death But tests have been made around the area and plants that would have been available to Chris were tested and no toxic berries or plants have been found The truth is probably that he starved Too few calories coming in high expenditure of calories for hunting and keeping warm resulted eventually in such a calorie deficit that he died Some good articles I found on Chris McCandless includehttpwwwnewsminercomnewsaphttpnmgegmuedutextandcommunityAlaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote I am exposed continually to what I will call the McCandless Phenomenon People nearly always young men come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent  When you consider McCandless from my perspective you quickly see that what he did wasnt even particularly daring just stupid tragic and inconsiderate First off he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area If he had had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament  Essentially Chris McCandless committed suicide Some may argue that this is what he wanted all along given his troubled pastAn update as of Sept  as to how McCandless died See httpwwwnewyorkercomonlineblogs which documents the poison contained in wild potato seeds Consuming these seeds introduces a neurotoxin into the body which results in lathyrism This condition causes gradual paralysis which ultimately made McCandless very weak unable to stand or walk and thus unable to forage or hunt for food   My grandfathernot an Alaskan but an experienced outdoorsmanwould have tied this kid to a tree and let the bears play tetherball with himA small part of me appreciates the effort Krakauer put into researching this book A much bigger part of me is completely disgusted both with McCandless himself and with Krakauers mindless adoration of him Krakauer pulls out all the stops to make McCandless look like a phenomenon and seems to agree with McCandless that the world should have handed itself to him on a silver salver because he was just so darned special Were told he was brilliant independent funny kind musical athletic visionary talented Can you see the halo Unfortunately the impression that comes across is of a snotty adolescent who has never seriously thought of anyone but himself and is used to getting by on charm and flippancy rather than making good use of his considerable gifts and I do not doubt that he was gifted The conflicting aspects of his personality dont sound quirky they sound devious and selfservingKrakauer tries halfheartedly to disguise his fascination but his admissions that McCandless was a clueless young hothead sound insincere he has to say it to sound credible to his readers who are less smitten Krakauer makes an apt comparison between himself as an idealistic and foolhardy young man and McCandless and then dismisses himself because he didnt have McCandless intellect This sounds utterly bogus after all we have been told about McCandless foolish mistakes and the obvious fact that Krakauer is not stupid Two chapters that could have provided some insight into his hero are wasted because Krakauer sounds like a religious fanatic with McCandless as his unknowable God and Krakauer as the Imnotworthy followerMcCandless and Everett Ruess overconfidence speaks to a fascination with nature but not a respect for it Courage is not the same as not knowing when we ought to have a healthy degree of fear Instead McCandless arrogantly drives his car into the habitat of an endangered species of poppy He butchers a moose wasting the life of a beautiful and welladapted animal because he could not be bothered to learn ahead of time how to preserve itThis was not a tragedy this was inevitable I dont believe he was schizophrenic or suicidal Bipolar or ADD maybe His own friends readily admitted that he had a lot of enthusiasm but little common sense and didnt know much outside of academia There are so many glaring outdoorsmanship errors made in the first two chapter that even I was cringingI write this with full admission that I am not much of an outdoorsperson However I dont believe for a minute that he lasted longer than most of us would have or that at least he tried it as so many of his fans insist I wouldnt try it not because Im scared but because I can tell from here that ten pounds of rice and no preparation is a recipe for failure I dont need to try it and if I did Id want to live to get something out of it Lots of other people have gone into the wilderness and come out just fine because they knew the magnitude of their own insignificance and planned aheadIm not jealous of his alleged brilliance either I was accepted to Emory And the University of Chicago And a couple of other amply respected schools Lots of people are Big deal His bourgeois status made his adventure possible in the first place He had money to pay his college tuition the rest of us graduated and went to work to pay off our loans He also had the gall to complain about his parents offers to help him out which smacks of a kid given so much that he doesnt know how fortunate he isFurthermore living with nothing by choice is very different from living with nothing because you have no alternative Though Im sure he would have denied it McCandless had the option of going back to his affluent life if he had wanted to or if he had had to in an emergency Maybe it would have knocked his selfimage for a loop but he would have been sheltered fed and nursed back to health A lot of people live in poverty without that safety net  Now is not the time to be squeamish about killing animals Hint There are no vegetarian Aleut This guy was a history and anthropology major I learned in anthro that you can eat plants and lean protein until you burst and still starve to death if you arent getting enough calories Its very difficult to feed yourself if youre alone and dont have a lot of practice at it If he got this idea from Thoreau and London he wasnt reading very carefully McCandless should have read less Thoreau and more Donner Party Londons Alaskan experience was during the Klondike Gold Rush when he had plenty of help from others Thoreau lived in a cabin on the edge of town a mile and a half from the family home He was not in the wilderness Furthermore Thoreaus civil disobedience was a protest against the Mexican War and slavery not a petty defiance of matters of public safety such as mandatory car insurance McCandless was a rebel without a cause Booksmart cant save you now Successonly learning does not work Krakauer goes into raptures about McCandless education and intelligence to demonstrate the supposed tragedy of his loss Nice brain gymnastics but apples to oranges when what you need is practical knowledgeThis guy was idolized by some my college classmates most of whom were sheltered relatively wealthy urbanites They had the same vague and pathetic need for real experiences and arrogant expectation of success that comes from never having failed at anything in their lives For most of his trip McCandless was neither independent or selfreliant He got lost in Mexico it would have been more selfreliant to get a map and take charge of his own navigation He didnt eat for days until somebody felt sorry for him and fed him Once he was in a situation where there was nobody to step in for him he died in this respect I disagree with Krakauer that McCandless was any different from Carl McCunn Even at that point he left a note on the door of the bus begging for rescueThe best and most independent outdoorsmen spend years learning Just because you were a superstar student and athlete doesnt mean you get to skip all the hard work Ive no doubt that McCandless was smart but he was mindbogglingly ignorant and inexperienced Why are these selfdiscovery escapades always so selfcentered How about joining the Peace Corps Teaching in innercity schools Working in healthcare in a remote South Asian village If youre so disgusted with society why dont you do something to improve it rather than keeping all the enlightenment for yourself Nature is not your babysitter Nature doesnt care if you live or die Its survival of the fittest and humans compared to most animals are slow weak poorlyarmed poorlyinsulated have no stamina have poor senses of smell eyesight and hearing and are illadapted to go without clean water and food for any length of time We are clearly meant to live in groups and use tools This guy didnt even bring an ax He was already controlled and tainted by society or else he would not have worked so hard to avoid it His antisociety and antimaterialism were as controlling of him as is the materialism of those who think they can find themselves by buying the right clothes or drug habit or SUV Unprepared people who set out on illplanned adventures and need to be rescued are jackasses A lot of other peoplebetterprepared bettertrained and more sensible people such as park service volunteers and EMTsend up spending a lot of time and money and risking their own necks to save them McCandless spared everyone that trouble but Im sure theres a whole line of wannabes lined up to try it I hope they have to pay back every penny spent on their rescuesAnd Truth The bad news is that Truth is relative It doesnt exist in a vacuum What a waste   Overall I was pretty disappointed with this book The genesis of the book was an indepth magazine article and I suspect that the article was superb But I just dont think theres enough here to warrant an entire book As evidence I point to several lengthy chapters that have nothing to do with the underlying storythey discuss other people who have gone into the wild and surprisingly Krakauer includes a whole chapter about himselfMy other problem is that I found myself unable to identify or empathize with the central character here I think that Chris McCandless was not much more than a privileged entitled selfish and undeniably intelligent person who threw everything away and nearly destroyed his family for reasons that werent any clearer by the end of the book than they were at the beginning I worried far more about his parents and his sister who he called his best friend than I did about himI ended up finishing the book by skimming the last  or maybe even the last  I almost gave this only  star but decided to go with  because I want to give Krakauer the benefit of the doubtits a wellwritten book I just dont think it needed to be written at all   I live a life I suspect that is much like yours Wake up go to work come home eat dinner go to bed At the end of this weekly desert there might be a drink or ten to celebrate the victory over another five days of soulcrushing drudgeryI am a desk jockey A paper pusher I mean that literally I sit in my office and when people peer inside they will see me moving a sheet of paper from one side to the other It looks to the untrained eye like valuable labor When I get the chance though I head to the mountains to the wild I love the awayness of these trips At the risk of sounding absurdly curmudgeonly I like getting away from the crush of humanity and Im sure the crush of humanity appreciates my temporary absence There was at time when my friends and I would head out west every summer We picked a destination isolated challenging packed the car and plunged into the wilderness We undertook silly risks because we were younger and we laughed at consequences or at the possibility that there were consequences Once a little later on we gathered around a campfire four of us and swore  like characters from a young adult novel  that wed always do this that wed always head out to the mountains together Then we got older My friends married they started having kids and the mountains became a memory a slideshow of pictures that showed up on the screen savers of our computers Friends with whom Id jumped off cliffs slid down glaciers and climbed rocks matured overnight into sober professionals husbands and fathers It was remarkable how age engendered caution and squelched the desire for adventure That was my mindset when I picked up Into the Wild Jon Krakauers classic is to put it mildly a polarizing book Based on the people Ive surveyed Ive found that you either love it or you hate it and whether you love it or hate it will be determined by what you think about Christopher McCandless the young man at the center of Into the Wild You will be taken in by Chriss literate philosophical iconoclastic boundarypushing vagabondism Or you will be sickened by his selfishness his selfpity and the way he left a shattered family in his wake Either way you will have a vivid responseUpon graduating from Emory University and instead of going on to law school which was my choice McCandless gave away  to charity and began his life as a tramp or hobo as they sometimes like to be called I was in sixth grade when McCandless walked into the Alaskan wilderness and never returned He was  The power of Into the Wild is directly attributable to Krakauers empathy for his subject Krakauer is a solid adventure writer but hes not a prose stylist Rather he uses his own life experiences to connect with Chris on a very intimate personal level He does not attempt any faux objectivity that is often the hallmark of serious serious journalism Instead Krakauer admits straight up that he saw his younger self in Chris with the exception that Krakauer survived his youth while Chris did not For instance there is an autobiographical section in Into the Wild where Krakauer tells his story about climbing the Devils Thumb This could easily have been a selfserving digression but Krakauer uses that experience and the vividness of his memory to explore the the compulsions that drove Chris McCandless to follow his unique path to his destiny I think Chris in his own way was a towering figure he was the person I would like to be if I had more guts and less excuses He was a smart kid a college grad who came from money His parents were messed up but really whose parents arent After college instead of going to law school dont go to law school by the way he gave away  burned his credit cards and set out to see the west Whatever else you call him you cant call him a poser Like everyone he had his share of dreams and demons and he set out to follow his dreams and fight his demons Theres something to be said for what he put his parent through Still the world forces us to be our own person He went forward the best way he knew how defining himself along the way The tragedy of course is that the lessons he learned  about the value of friends and family  he learned too late I dont really need to defend Chris Krakauer does that He is unabashedly in his corner defending his choices his skills his desire to go alone to the far places like John Muir before him Chris McCandless was himself fully and completely which is saying a lot in this day and age Or any day and age He was part adventurer part philosopher and part monk the monk part fascinates Krakauer who spends a lot of time wondering whether Chris died a virgin I suppose a brief note on the movie directed by Sean Penn is in order While I found it poetic and inspiring the movie focuses too much on Chriss effect on the various people he meets on his journeys In a way Chris becomes some kind of wondering apostle healing and helping those he meets along his path before he dies a martyrs death in Alaska a vision from a Don Maclean song the world was never meant for one as beautiful as you The book on the other hand keeps Chris firmly grounded as a human being Krakauer admires Chris to be sure but he does not neglect the warts However Krakauer sharply dismisses those armchair psychiatrists who want to diagnose Chris with a mental disorder Im glad he does I think its saying soemething about the conformity of our society that anyone who bucks the trend he gave up law school is called mad In the end Chris was one of those rare people who wanted to know the world intimately and in the process of discovering those secrets was killed by that same world Maybe there was something quixotic or foolish in his quest maybe he should have taken a job taken a wife found a safe desk behind which to grow old Or maybe there is something foolish in us to believe that we can outlive the world with our caution    I love Jon Krakauer I didnt find one single thing about the Alex McCandless even remotely interesting He came across as a spoiled brat with no concept of reality  basically because of his priveleged upbringing But somehow he blamed his parents for that void of myopic self absorption I live in Alaska and Ive lived in Idaho and Colorado and Oregon    basically AROUND people who love the great outdoors I am more comfortable in a heated coffee shop READING about the great outdoors Still I know that heading into any forest  particularly one at that latitude and altitude in pursuit of adventure with a no food b no gear c no plan and d no backup plan is nothing short of delusional or maybe just stupidI absolutely adore Jon Krakauers attempts to explain Alexs possible motives and angst I get that Krakauer identifies with some of what gnawed at Alex    that discontent    that feeling that life cant possibly be this pointless    etc I wonder about those things with fairly consistent frequency I suppose I have my own means of stamping those feelings out alternating burst of extreme carbohydrate consumption and running or spinning work and volunteerism Still the fact that Alex died of exposure in an abandoned bus in Denali National Park is less poignant than poetic  justice that is Darwinism if you want to be cruel Cringe That sounded really awful didnt it But Krakauer carefully paints a picture of a young man completely disillusioned with the life that his parents provided for him the future they groomed him for A life easier better than theirs He points to his parents mistakes and flaws as lightening rods for Alexs rejection of them and his pursuit of deeper understanding What a luxury One that we all pursue at some point in our lives and if we have any sense grow out of I was constantly irritated with Alex for hitching homelessness biting every hand that tried to feed him His lonely desperate death not at all surprising and not terribly sad either    except for what it put his family through I had no interest in seeing the movie I saw trailer images of a young man looking off into the wildnerness with

"text": "Alone on a desert island  everything and everyone he knows and loves has been washed away in a storm  Mau is the last surviving member of his nation Hes completely alone  or so he thinks until he finds the ghost girl She has no toes wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird and gives him a stick that can make fireDaphne sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark Shes certain her father distant cousin of the Royal family will come and rescue her but it seems for now that all she has for company is the boy and the foulmouthed ships parrot until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island Together Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things including how to milk a pig and why spitting in beer is a good thing and start to forge a new nationEncompassing themes of death and nationhood Terry Pratchetts new novel is as can be expected extremely funny witty and wise Maus ancestors have something to teach us all Mau just wishes they would shut up about it and let him get on with saving everyones lives Philip Pullman is known perhaps infamously for His Dark Materials trilogy which has been attacked because of Pullmans atheist beliefs as well as the endorsement of atheism that book represents Pullman isnt the only writer to have been attacked due to his view on religion and I doubt that he will be the last one Of course he will undoubtedly be attacked this year because of his new book about Jesus and his buddy ChristI find it strange that there was barely a peep about the books until the movie came outThe problem as I see it with such fame as Pullman receives is that people get hot and bothered either condemning the work or justly defending the work So hot and bothered that books like Nation get overlooked In many ways this is good for no one is trying to ban the book In other ways it is bad for the book doesnt get the fame it deservesTerry Pratchett is a humanist writer of fantasy fiction He wouldnt call his work literature but many of his later novels either is literature or rests on literatures mutable border Ive been a huge fan of Pratchett since Wyrd Sisters made me laugh during a very tough time in my life Thanks Mom for giving the book to me Nation is the best thing that Pratchett has ever writtenNation is LiteratureIm not sure if Nation was inspired by the Tsunami in Asia andor Pratchett receiving his medical news In truth I dont really care I do know for Pratchett himself has said it that Nation demanded to be told and he stopped other projects to write itSupposedly a childrens book Nation tells the story of Mau who loses his whole Nation his whole tribe when a tsunami hits his island home Eventually Mau discovers Daphne a ghost girl who was washed up by the same wave What then follows is part Robinson Crusoe told from Fridays point of view part Swiss Family Robinson part Island of the Blue Dolphins and part religious and philosophical debatePratchetts novels work because each of his characters is like the reader or like someone the reader knows His characters are human and contain one or more aspects of everyone Even Pratchetts most heroic or inhuman characters such as Carrot Rincewind or Death have human traits that effect how they act remember Death really likes cats Here in this book Pratchett presents multiple answers to the questions Why do bad things happen to good people if there is a just god and How do you feel afterwardsBoth Mau and Daphne have tragically lost family Both of their reactions are human yet different from each other Both question the idea of god or in the case of Mau gods and faith Both arrive at different answers More importantly Pratchett doesnt preach he doesnt persuade He just wants the reader to think the conclusion is left up to the reader This makes the book totally honest for there is no clear cut answer to the first questionBesides engaging the idea of the god debate Pratchett touches on another part of creation  where do stories come from Are stories more than just religion Is religion more than story This comes as no surprise to the reader who has read the last two Science of Discworld booksDespite the tragic and bittersweet events of the story Pratchetts trademark humor including footnotes is present in full force Like his characters Pratchetts humor works because it contains an element of human truth As the following exchange showsDont look backWhy notBecause I just did Run fasterThe tale of Mau and Daphne is an adventure tale of two teens surviving the aftermath of a natural disaster They most rebuild They must outwit cold blooded killers and hungry cannibal as well as the odd Grandfather Bird and tree climbing octopus It is a thrillingly story that closely honestly and fairly examines faith science and all in betweenOlder ReviewWhen Nation came out I was a bit disappointed that it wasnt a Discworld novelThen I read itIts the best thing that Pratchett has ever writtenThe one thing about Terry Pratchett as Lawrence WattEvans pointed out is that the only real difference between his adult books and his children books are the age of his protagonists There is no reason why an adult shouldnt treat this as a bookIts a book everyone should readI suppose if Pratchett had the reputation or high profile of Philip Pullman or J K Rowling then there would be a huge cry of how this book should be snatched from the hands of impressable children before they learn how to think for themselves Maybe there is already such an outcry but I havent heard anythingNation reminds me a bit of Island of the Blue Dolphins with much more thrown in Pratchett addresses the big questions of whether or not there is a god and if there is a god why do bad things happen Bad things happen in this book right from the start Pratchett deserves credit for not sugarcoating what happens but for also dealing with the deathes in a way that does not alienate or upset readers okay upset them too muchWhat Pratchett presents for the reader is a book about what extactly faith and life are When one reads Pullman it is quite easy to figure out where Pullman stands in regards to religion It is not easy to figure out where Pratchett stands One character has lost his faith but may or may not be talking to the gods Other characters have faith Neither character is seen as stupid or evil because of a belief or lack of belief In many ways Nation is a more mature novel about faith than Pratchetts earlier tolerance novel Small GodsThis a powerful book and I hope it continues to fly under the radar of those people who think children shouldnt read books that make you thinkEveryone should read this book   Terry Pratchett is a weird and wonderful writer his style is completely unique There really is no other author quite like him and there will probably never be another a true orginal His humour is so strange but remarkably witty Some of the metaphors he uses are just plain genius This is the first Terry Pratchett book I read and I really do need to go and read some more This novel takes place on a wacky island full of strange creatures and even stranger people The islands bananas are pink the trees secrete poison it has tree climbing octopus and stones that are worshipped as gods by the inhabitants Doesnt it just sound like a great place Unfortunately for Mau one of two protagonists in this novel his tribe is wiped out by a great wave that surges all nearby landHe could see that the village had gone The wave had sliced it off the island A few stumps marked the place the long house had stood since for ever The wave had torn up the reef A wave like that would not have even noticed the villageOn the other hand the island itself remains intact Mau however doesnt have a soul He was completing his initiation to manhood when the wave struck he didnt get chance to finish as the initiators all died leaving his transcendence incomplete Whats the poor halfman to do He concocts a death wish plain and simple Theres no reason to live anymore Well until the second protagonists boat Sweet Jude shipwrecks her on the island Ermintrude later called Daphne is a trouserwoman a person from civilisation who is not a tribal and is defined by her cultures wearing of trousers Quite funny really these people are silly trousermen and silly trouserwomen well at least they are to Mau Pratchett has created a brilliant narrative voice for Mau that is ever so evocative of his innocence and of his humorous perceptions of westerners Ermintrude almost shoots him when they first meet and the poor lad thinks the gun is a sparkmaker to help with building fires Is this a frown at imperialism I think so Ermintrude is also a lady who loves to use the etiquette her Grandmother has taught her quite the contrast to Maus tribal standards After the two get over their first hilariously embarrassing attempts of communication and manage to gain a small degree of understanding of one another they must try to survive on the remains of the wonderful island No easy task considering another bunch of people wash up on island including a wise old priest a pregnant mute woman and eventually another family group This is foreshadowed by the approaching cannibalistic raiders that want to kill everyone on the island Mau and Daphne must solidify their newly forming culture with the remains of the old one and learn to surviveThis book was great The writing was superb the plot exciting and the characters well rounded and funny More importantly however Terry pratchett is an uplifting change to those novelists who take themselves too seriously I should read more books like this books that are random and odd Heres a picture of a bird   Dear Terry Pratchett It is entirely unfair that every book of yours I read increases my estimation for you At some point you will no longer be able to live up to my expectations and on that day I am probably going to crySincerely Cait who is thinking about getting a hermit crab tattooI kind of dont want to talk about the plot because Native boy and English girl survive tsunami build empire of survivors and create a nation of science does not convey how awesome it all is Guys this book is fantastic Its about comingofage religion science culture exploration tsunamis the South Pacific mysterious powers behind the throne and also and if you needed an also I am going to point out that you and I might not be able to be friends anymore there are tree climbing octopodes Seriously what more can you ask    Disclaimer Im about to wax poetic in a totally corny way Just warning youI am and have been for years of the opinion that Pratchett is the best writer there is He continually serves up pitch perfect depictions of spectacular characters who are both wonderfully inventive and at the same time purposefully normal And in every book hidden in the hilarity and the side splitting satire is a perfect pearl of truth about human nature I remember when I first found one It was the slender and yet unbreakable thread connecting the commercial idiocy of our Christmas season with a sweaty desperate beast running for its life through a winter night knowing its death was inevitable Hogfather was a revelation for me For years Pratchett fans have been telling anyone who will listen that only the jokes kept Pratchett from being called a literary genius by the mainstream For me Nation is the final proof No story that opens with such souldeep sorrow can be called a comedy There is some humor of course The foul mouthed parrot is hard to miss but even that has a somewhat sinister explanation This is the first Pratchett book that I had to finish in one sitting Always before they were savored over days I knew I could trust Disc World to be alright in the end and if some people met death in the process well hes a pretty good guy all around so wheres the harm in that But Nation is not set on Disc World but much closer to home so I had to stay up until  AM to see how it all ended Death is a much scarier guy in this book although at the end much the same The pearl of wisdom in this book is not small and not hidden Its sitting right out there in the middle of the stage with flashing lights over its head This is about why we believe or choose not to believe In something In anything Its about us but then again it always is even when its also about trolls and dwarves And as always it is the characters that catch me Two seemingly normal individuals made extraordinary by circumstances and the way they react in those circumstances In the end I love Pratchett because he can show me characters that I know are human all the way to their toes and yet they give me hope Mau Vimes Granny Weatherwax even the Patrician they dont do what they do so that people will thank them appreciate them worship them They do what they do because it needs doing and no one else stood up for the job They do the hard jobs they give up certain niceties in life so that at the end of the day all is well not just for them but for everyone It gives me faith that somewhere in this world there are men and women like that It gives me hope that the human race as a whole might be worthwhile In the end all I can say is Terry Thanks   Young Mau is a boy living on an island he knows only as the Nation He has been sent to the Boys Island where he must survive until he can using only the tools of the island build a canoe that will take him on the return voyage to the Nation By doing so he will prove that he is a man and the village will celebrate as he sheds his boys soul and takes on his mans soul Except when he returns there are no fires There are no feasts There is no one to welcome him home What is there is death destruction and the dawning realization that the Nation a powerful island tribe has now been reduced to a population of one If Mau dies then the Nationits heritage its ancestors its religionwill die tooThis book had two strikes against it when I picked it up  its marketed as young adult and  my one foray into Pratchetts writing The Color of Magic was underwhelming So Nation was a very pleasant surprise This isnt young adult literature in the sense that its written strictly for a younger audience but I think it has been labeled as such because the protagonist is young and now that no one is there to perform the rituals that will draw his mans soul to him wonders if hell always be more than a boy but less than a manWhat seems to be a deceptively simple adventure tale on the surface has levels of complexity as it explores issues tied to colonialism existentialism feminism and racism and one must admit thats an impressive collection of isms As Mau works tirelessly to bury the bodies at sea according to custom he begins toas so many do after a traumatic and lifealtering crisisquestion the gods and everything hes ever been taught to believe in This confrontation with the void is complicated by the fact that Mau suddenly hears what may be the voices of the gods speaking directly to him When he comes into contact with whites he questions whether or not his people who seemed to have everything were really inferior savages Now if all that sounds terribly tedious and didactic to you WAITTHERES MORE Theres also action adventure romance and humor There are tsunamis shipwrecks mutineers kings secret passages sharks beer cannons and a foulmouthed parrot And theres a damsel who can take care of herself thank you very muchAnd thats the wonderful thing about this book It causes the reader to think while being entertained And Pratchett accomplishes all of this without being preachy or trying to substitute his answer for your own In fact his message seems to be that you must have faith in somethingwhether its a god a science or a nation As long as what you believe in is good and furthers mankind your faith is not wasted Perhaps his stance is best summed up by one of the charactersEverything I know makes me believe Imo the god of the islanders is in the order that is inherent amazingly in all things and in the way the universe opens to our questioning When I see the shining path over the lagoon on an evening like this at the end of a good day I believe    I just believe You know in things generally That works too Religion is not an exact science Sometimes of course neither is science In Nation as in life there are no easy answers but as in life its one helluva rideCross posted at This Insignificant Cinder and at Shelf Inflicted   "},

"isbn": "0544668251",
"author": "Randall Munroe",
"text": "In Thing Explainer Complicated Stuff in Simple Words things are explained in the style of Up Goer Five using only drawings and a vocabulary of the  or ten hundred most common words Explore computer buildings datacenters the flat rocks we live on tectonic plates the things you use to steer a plane airliner cockpit controls and the little bags of water youre made of cells I loved the German translation so much that I had to buy the English edition too and of course it was better The book has such an excellent idea that I only really thought about that when I read it in German but in the original you can see what a poet Munroe is and poetry never really translates quite right Here are some of my favorite passages   Rather perversely given that I keep telling people I dont like translations I read Randall Munroes new book in German  but I thought it might help develop my language skills to go through this unusual piece of work where the inventive Mr Munroe spends sixtyone A pages explaining a lot of complicated things using a vocabulary of only the one thousand most common words My feeling is that its done me some good despite the disapproving look I got from one of my germanophone colleagues Youll learn all the wrong vocabulary she sighed shaking her head But Ive hopefully escaped intact my German is good enough by now that Im not likely to believe Bildermacher really is the word for camera or Hochziehzimmer the word for elevator or Himmelsboot the word for airplane Anyway enough about that The content of the book is more interesting than the languageMost people seem to be treating Thing Explainer as no more than a weird bit of entertainment but like Perec in La disparition I think the author isnt just doing it to demonstrate his ingenuity A couple of weeks ago I read an annoying novel called Topologie de lamour which purports to give you an idea of what mathematicians are like The author has evidently met some mathematicians and hes by no means wrong about everything for example mathematicians tend to be very impractical in romantic matters What he missed though is that the interesting thing about them isnt their habit of falling in love with the wrong people but their way of looking at the world Munroes book does a far better job of conveying what that unusual angle isClever people as Munroe says in the introduction typically like to demonstrate that theyre clever by using big unusual words Mathematicians dont exactly refuse to use big words and they can also think its fun to show off this way But in their hearts mathematicians dont want to do this Mathematics is all about reducing things to their essence and that means using as few words as possible If a mathematician could get by using only one word that would make them truly happy Formal logic is the most thoroughgoing expression of this impossible dream Thing Explainer doesnt go to such absurd lengths but Munroe shows that you dont need to know a lot of words to be clever its enough to understand what the words really mean and how they are connected to each other and to the world He gives wonderful concise explanations of things like plate tectonics and how a cyclone forms and the strategy the Mars Rovers used to come down successfully in one piece I learned here how a turbofan works  for some reason I had never got around to finding out He has the best onesentence summary of quantum mechanics I have ever seen About a hundred years ago people learned that the idea of Where doesnt always work for very small things When you describe things in this unusual way you can get a different idea of them and you can think that the big words you normally use are really stopping you from seeing the world instead of helping you see it better Munroe has a couple of deadpan helpfully informative pages on nuclear weapons Machines for burning cities When he gives you a schematic of a Trident submarine Worldending boat and the history that led up to building this interesting device its possible that you may briefly wonder whether it is in fact a good thingOn the last page Munroe shows you the Tree of Life the family tree of all the living things there have ever been who as he says are all related to each other Or to be exact he shows you a tiny part of this tree  which really should contain a branch for every creature alive and the many many more that used to be alive and are now dead He asks you to imagine all the grains of sand there are on all the beaches on Earth And then he asks you to imagine that each of those grains was another whole Earth with its own seas and beaches and how many grains of sand you would have if you added all those beaches together Well thats how many branches you would need to draw if you really drew the Tree of LifeAs he says in the books last sentence next to the world we are talking about all our words are small   Randall Munroes XKCD comic is a delight to read What If was fabulous so I was expecting something even more from Thing Explainer Extremely disappointed By utilizing only the  most common words to write this book Munroe created a confusing mess The simplistic language created a moment or two of cheeky comedy but for the most part it was a confusing in the most annoying sense of the term way to have complex ideas explained Just call it Mitochondria and then talk about how its a bag of water full of bags of water with more bags of water facepalm   I have been a long time fan of xkcd a delightfully nerdy and funny webcomic that has a wonderful mix of science humor and the occasional pun If you like science and humor and arent reading xkcd you need to zip on over there statWhen I heard that Munroe the artistwriter of xkcd announced he was going to put out a book explaining things using his simple yet elegant art style I was excited Here was a person who knew science had a passion for educating the masses about it and had a subtle but wicked sense of humor to help deliver the information And for the most part I greatly enjoyed the book all  very very dense pages of it But I felt the book hamstrung itself a bit too muchIn the course of trying to make this book as accessible as possible a good thing Munroe limited himself to the thousand most common words in the English language While I commend his enthusiasm and goal of making the book accessible to the masses I thought this tactic limited the book in several places This book delves into both the common place dishwashers light elevators and the complex nuclear weapons biological cells computers and while it is nice to have components explained in straightforward ways some pieces are just so complex or specialized that using this plain language is either unhelpful or providesFor instance Munroe typically has to use the word water for liquids and air for all gases Because they were used in some many places it would be easy for a person to get confused and mistake different kinds of water and air In these cases the goal of simplifying the language for the masses could easily result in confusion Maybe if he had upped the number of allowable words to  or  things would have been much clearer and probably still as accessibleBut that doesnt detract too much from some of the great great art and humor in this book Munroe has some very straightforward but detailed drawings of the various subjects with some nice little humorous asides or pictures folded in This book is quite educations and would be a great resource both for children just starting to learn about the world sort of an updated The Way Things Work and adults who just want to learn more about the world Even areas I was already familiar with were shown in a new and humorous light   This book read itRandall Munroe never ever fails to make me laugh Having been indoctrinated to internet humor at a very young age okay so like my late teens with xkcd I was entirely thrilled to learn about What If being released some nine years after that and thats still one of the funniest books Ive ever read I wrote a longform book review about it for my librarys newsletter Its really that goodThing Explainer is just as good I hesitate to use the word better for two reasons  first of all because What If is the book I would have written if I were smart enough to write it which is to say it is exactly my kind of knowledge delivery system using exactly my kind of humor and second of all because Randall Munroe needs to be capped No one should be allowed to be this funny so for the rest of us were going to have to level cap his humor and if I say Thing Explainer is better than theres no point in living except to read more Randall Munroe books It is written using only the one thousand  er ten hundred  most commonly used words in English and he includes a list of those words as well as his reasons for using the list that he did but is written with such a deep understanding of those topics that its impossible not to understand the concepts hes driving at And I honesttogod learned something Lots of things actuallyMy favorite pages in the book were the Red World Space Car Mars rover the Food heating radio box microwave The pieces everything is made of periodic table and of course the Machine for burning cities nuclear bomb If you didnt laugh once after reading that sentence this book is not for you and also we should not be friendsHonestly I posted so many pictures of so many excerpts of this book on Instagram that I should be sued for copyright infringement But it really was just that good and I really did want to share it that much So do yourself a favor go out and get this book and open it up to any page and just read Youll learn something And youll be glad you did   "},

"text": "The Tales of Beedle the Bard a Wizarding classic first came to Muggle readers attention in the book known as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Now thanks to Hermione Grangers new translation from the ancient runes we present this stunning edition with an introduction notes and illustrations by J K Rowling and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales The Wizard and the Hopping Pot The Fountain of Fair Fortune The Warlocks Hairy Heart Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump and of course The Tale of the Three Brothers But not only are they the equal of fairy tales we now know and love reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter                                               I felt very warm and fuzzy reading new JKR How can I not love an alleged childrens writer who mentions murder mutilation cannibalism adultery and bestiality all within the span of  ultrashort pages The stories are on the meh side but Dumbledores commentaries showed a smart literary eye that reminded me briefly of Pale Fire Im all Hey JK you did your thang Be that as it may Im a bit offended by the Dumbledores antiantiMuggle bias I see nothing wrong with witches and wizards not wanting to associate with Muggles I hate Muggles they are the worst And I have Muggle heritage myself but dont tell anyone I said that EEW EEW EEW so you know I cant be magicist Sometimes I look in the mirror and I think Go back to where you came from Mudblood So I did  but the staff at New York Presbyterian wouldnt take me back   I actually started this a few nights ago and would read one story each night but completely forgot to add it to my currently reading shelf I absolutely loved these stories as well as Dumbledores commentary I learned some new things and connected a few others They were such a phenomenal addition to the books especially Deathly Hallows I will forever love The Tale of the Three Brothers and it will always be a classic tale for me I cant believe how much effort JK Rowling put into every single aspect of her series just to make it that much more wonderful I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making This takes so much time effort and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series Every addition to this amazing series brings me so much joy and I cant say enough good things I highly recommend giving these a read You wont be disappointed She gave it her all and I could never give this less than  stars    Im having a hard time deciding which is my favorite tale but Id lean towards The Fountain of Fair Fortune with the The Warlocks Hairy Heart coming in a close second if only it had been executed a little betterKeeping in mind that these are wizarding fairy tales with commentary by Dumbledore and translated by Hermione oh MAN wouldnt it be awesome to get into a crazy discussion about Hermione as a biased translator Dumbledores comments are obviously  biased  the book is really quite cute It shouldnt take you much more than  minutes to read it but I was expecting a short readand honestly my  complaint is the binding t he book just feels awkward and I am dreading when the spine is obviously cracked openSpoilers start hereTale  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot The most obvious morality tale in the book A young man inherits his fathers cauldron and his fathers requests for aid from needy but humble  worthy Muggle neighbors resists with an attitude and is taught a lesson in charity I found Dumbledores notes more interesting than the tale itselfTale  The Fountain of Fair Fortune Almost a Wizard of Oztype story a Muggle Knight and  witches quest for their greatest wish to be granted at the Fountain of Fair Fortune but end up solving their problems on the journey I really think JKR could have expanded this out into much more of a short story although it does make sense in the fablefairy tale format Really quite cute and the happiest of the bunchTale  The Wizards Hairy Heart Obviously the darkest tale a man turns to the Dark Arts and cuts himself off from enjoying life by literally taking his beating heart out of his chest so he will never be hurt Dumbledores notes sort of point towards the ZOMG TERRIBLE HORCRUX IS TERRIBLE idea but never outright says so this Tom Riddle kid TOTALLY ate this one up at the Muggle orphanageOH WAIT HE TOTALLY DIDNTTale  Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump A really stupid Muggle king wants to wipe out witches and wizards gets scammed by a con man but his dishwasher is a real witch and not only stops the persecution but even gets a gold statue through her own cunning I think this was my least favorite out of the Tale  The Tale of the Three Brothers We know this one from Deathly Hallows but  brothers run into Death get the Elder Wand the resurrection stone thing and the Invisibility Cloak Brothers  and  are totally dumb and die pretty quickly but Brother  knows meeting Death is inevitable but hides and lives into old age Again Dumbledores notes are very vague and full of NOW THIS WANDSTONE BUSINESS IS TOTALLY FOLKLORE also can I just say how much the term Deathstick amuses me to no end BUT INVISIBILITY CLOAKS RUUUULE Overall its sort of cool to think how these tales might have played into the upbringing of some of the characters The Weasley kids probably heard all of these  million timesOh AND I forgot my favorite part is when Dumbledore goes into as close as he can get into a rant about censorship concerning the content of the tales the Malfoys across the ages are big into banning books Its even more funny considering HPs history and the fact that JKR was nice enough to let Dumbledore give the gentle smackdown   Now I happened to be at a WalMart at  pm on December third the day before this book was to be released Upon my arrival to the inside of the store I saw a table decorated with a single blue balloon and a plastic tablecloth Taped across the front of the small buffet table was a sign that said Join us at  for Tales of Beedle the Bard Needless to say I squealed aloud with delight and my best friend blushed with embarrassment at being seen in public with a squealing Harry Potter fan I could hardly believe that I had forgotten the realease date for the storybook Harry Potter fans everywhere were waiting for Of course I searched frantically for my wallet but it was nowhere to be found lost in the abyss that is my purse As I began to walk away with my head hung low Kristen the dearest friend Ive ever known then took me by the hand and led me back to the table She told me that she would buy me the book as an early Christmas present but I had to promise to love it And that very night after I had finished the book my promise was kept and I loved it    "},

of these The best thing about this book is that it lets you to hear from Linus and to hear about LinusThere seems to be two points of view Linus as he sees himself and Linus as he is seen by others And it is very interesting to compare these two sites points of view And your own tooThis book may be interesting to people who dont know anything about technology but they are interested in celebrities But it is interesting to people who want to know everything about Linux how it was born how it was developed what did it take to make Linux as we see it today and maybe what it is going to be in future Linus also explains his opinion about open source and copyright which is really interesting More than that he does his best to answer all these questions that people keep on asking him So I strongly recommend the book to everyone whether you know Linus or Linux or not Linus experience is very inspiring   kinda split about this one i went into it expecting a certain character to linus and finding a totally different onei guess i shouldnt be surprised i had the notion of the rockstar shattered many moons ago in the end linus is just another guy with flaws just like anyone else heck linux wouldnt exist if he hadnt accidentially tried to dial the university of helsinki through devhda instead of devtty theres a resiliency and an honesty to him i really like even if he seems to try to avoid every argument despite this he still has lessthanfavorable things to say about gates jobs stallman and tanenbaum to name a few which is good for a few laughs in the end i enjoyed the fact that the book made the legendary linus unremarkably human the pithy technical bits at the beginning were great i wouldnt have liked it as much without them im also not entirely disturbed that the book wasnt entirely composed of them the switching back and forth between linus and david was interesting and added a little extra perspective it also wasnt overused to the point of being annoying which it certainly could have beenlinus does reveal a few philosophical thoughts not just on open source mind you he offers his law of life so to speak interesting as it is it is not a life changing insight nor is really anything else in the booklets face it linus did what he did because he enjoyed hacking and he liked people getting excited about it and providing him new challenges to flex his hacking muscles so he kept doing it he didnt set out to change the world or become rich but he doesnt mind having done either i think if theres anything that i learned from this book is that linux is great because it is a global community projectif lance armstrong can be remembered by its not about the bike then linux should be remembered by its not about the initial creatorthat being said though it was entertaining to know about linus id probably not be recommending this book as much as i might recommend reading the gpl    I thought I might get excited about open source as a conceptbut its a pretty straightforwardly awesome concept so I didnt find anything surprising What IS interesting philosophically is that he comes right out and says This is my life philosophy Its really only touched upon at the beginning and end but sort of exemplified through the whole quirky detailed fun story of this guys life Hes a weird dude both in what he says about his past his attitude toward it and how he acts while being interviewed about it Its strangely relaxing to read He just has this very mellow attitude So I recommend it if youre interested in him at all or feel like a weirdquirky programmer dude or even if you just like memoirs I dont know much about Linux nor did I have any expectations of Linus and yet I found it to be this pleasant reflection on actually DOING something with your life just becausejust for fun                                                                                                                    "},

"author": "Neil Gaiman",
"text": "Nobody Owens known to his friends as Bod is a normal boy He would be completely normal if he didnt live in a graveyard being raised and educated by ghostsThere are dangers and adventures for Bod in the graveyard But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bods family Recently on a car trip with my little boy I decided to try listening to an audiobook In the past this hasnt been a success He loves to be read to in person both picture books and chapter books But he not a fan of listening to books in the car At best hes indifferent but usually he just asks me to turn them off Generally speaking hed prefer to listen to Macklemores Thrift Shop which he calls The Sway Music But hes four now with a vocabulary thats diverse to the point of being a little creepy I taught him cruft yesterday So I plugged in the Audio of Gaimans Graveyard book For those of you who dont know Gaiman reads his own audiobooks more often than not Lovely accent aside hes fucking amazing at it Really irritatingly good We listened to it for about  minutes or so then I heard him saying Dad Dad from the back seat I sighed and turned it off I expected him to tell me that this was boring and we should stop Or that he wanted to listen to the Sway Music or one of his as he puts it Kid CDs But it wasnt anything of the sort instead he said Dad Im listening to the story and I can see the pictures in my head Really I askedYeah he says Its like a movie I couldnt be happier Neil Gaiman as his first audio My boy has good taste What does it look like in your head I ask Theres a hill and on the top of it there is a fence and a graveyard We talk about the story for a little bit Hes slightly confused on some points he thinks the boys name is Jack and he thought that the man who was coming to hurt the boy was invisible except for his hand Which is understandable given the way Gaiman describes things focusing on the hand and the knife But generally he was getting it More importantly he was enjoying it I know this because for the next couple days whenever we got into the car he asked if we could listen to the story of the boy that lived in the graveyard Yes yes we can    Ive noticed that theres been an increased interest in the macabre in childrens literature lately Sometimes when Ive had a glass or two of wine and Im in a contemplative mood I try weaving together a postulation that ties the current love of violent movies into this rise in childrens literary darkness Is the violence of the world today trickling down into our entertainment Hogwash and poppycock and other words of scoff and denial says sober I But Ive certainly seen a distinct rise in the Gothic and otherworldly over the last few years and one wonders if its because kids want more of that kind of stuff or publishers are merely getting less squeamish All that aside generally Ill read a May Bird book or an Everlost title and theyll be fun examinations of the hereafter but not the kind of things that touch my heart Great writing doesnt have to transcend its genre It just has to be emotionally honest with the reader And The Graveyard Book is one of the most emotionally honest books Ive yet to have read this year Smart and focused touching and wry it takes the story of a boy raised by ghosts and extends it beyond the restrictive borders of the setting Great stuffIt starts with three murders There were supposed to be four The man Jack was one of the best maybe THE best and how hard is it to kill a toddler anyway But on that particular night the little boy went for a midnight toddle out the front door while the murderer was busy and straight into the nearby graveyard Saved and protected by the denizens of that particular abode the ghosts and the far more corporeal if mysterious Silas the little boy is called Bod short for Nobody because no one knows his name As he grows older Bod learns the secrets of the graveyard though he has to be careful The man or is it men who killed his family could come back for him Best to stay quiet and out of sight Yet as Bod grows older it becomes clear that hiding may not be the best way to confront his enemies And whats more Bod must come to grips with what it means to grow upCan I level with you You know Coraline Mr Gaimans previous foray into middle grade childrens literature Come close now I dont want to speak too loudly Uh I didnt much care for it WAIT Come back come back I didnt mean it Well maybe I did a tad It was a nice book A sufficient story But it was very much new category alert an adultauthortochildrensauthorfirsttimertitle Gaiman appeared to be finding his sealegs with Coraline He took the old Alice in Wonderland trope which adult authors naturally gravitate to on their first tries see Un Lun Dun Summerland The King in the Window etc Throw in some rats bees and buttons and voila Instant success But Coraline for all its readability and charm didnt get me here thumps chest I didnt feel emotionally close to the material Now why it should be that Id feel closer emotionally to a book filled with a plethora of ghosts ghouls nightgaunts and Hounds of God I can only chalk up to The Graveyard Books strong vision My husband likes to say that the whole reason Buffy the Vampire Slayer worked as a television show was that it was a natural metaphor for the high school and eventually college experience Likewise The Graveyard Book has this strongstrange wonderful metaphor about kids growing up learning about the wider world and exploring beyond the safe boundaries of their homes Theres so much you can read into this book I mean arent all adults just ghosts to kids anyway Those funny talking people whose time has passed but that may provide some shelter and wisdom against the wider crueler world Plus Mr Gaiman also includes characters in Bods world that kids will wish they had in their own Silas a man who may be a vampire though the word is never said is every childs fantasy A mysteriousmagical guardianfriend who will tell you the truth when your parents will notOne thing I particularly liked about the book was the fact that Bod makes quite a few careless or thoughtless mistakes and yet you dont feel particularly inclined to throttle him because of them Too often in a work of fiction a person isnt properly put into the head of their protagonist So when that character walks off and does something stupid theres the sense sometimes faint sometimes not that they deserved it and youre not going to stick around and read about somebody that dumb are you But even when Bod is at his most intolerable his most childishly selfish and singleminded you can understand and sympathize with him Bod is no brat a fact that implies right there that he is someone worth rooting for We see our own young selves in Bod and we root for him as a result And as Bod reaches each stage in his growth he encounters experiences and personalities that help him to reach maturity Thats a lot to put on the plate of a lil ole fantasy novel particularly one thats appropriate for younger kidsAnd it is appropriate too Dont let the fact that the first sentence in the book There was a hand in the darkness and it held a knife put you off The murder of Bods family is swift immediate and offscreen What remains is just a great fantasy novel that has the potential to appeal to both boy and girl readers Kid wants a ghost story Check Kid wants a fantasy novel set in another world appropriate for Harry Potter fans Check Kid wants a good book Thats my favorite request When the elevenyearold comes up to my desk and begs for a good book I can just show them the cover and the title of this puppy and feel zero guilt when their little eyes light up A good book it isI guess that if I have any objections at all to the title it has something to do with the villains Theyre a bit sketchy which I suppose is the point but we live in an era where childrens fantasy novels spend oodles of time defining their antagonists motivations and histories Gaimans more interested in his hero which is natural but the villains raison dtre is just a bit too vague for the average reader Honestly if it werent for the fact that Bods family is slaughtered at the start of this tale you wouldnt necessarily know whether or not to believe that these people are as nasty as weve been toldThat said the books a peach I once heard someone postulate that maybe Neil Gaiman wrote it just so that he could play with the sentence It takes a graveyard to raise a child Unlikely Fun but unlikely I mean he does make a casual allusion that isnt far off from that phrase but he never goes whole hog This book doesnt feel like it was written to back up a joke It feels like a book written by a parent with children growing up and moving out Its a title that tips its hat to kids making their way in the world their pasts behind them their futures unknown This is not yet another silly little fantasy novel but something with weight and depth The fact that it just happens to be loads of fun to boot is simply a nice bonus Highly recommendedAges  and up      This is a summary of this magical sweet and imaginative story for children which in a good tradition of the Brothers Grimm started with a triple homicide   Neil Gaiman does not waste time with unicorns and princesses and butterflies which are often considered acceptable for children He kicks off his book with the brutal murders of a childs entire family written in a chilling tone that made me quickly turn all the lights on in my bedroom Nobody Owens named so because he looks like nobody but himself or simply Bod is the sole survivor of the aforementioned triple homicide who is in The Jungle Book style promptly adopted by a sweet ghost couple in the graveyard inhabited by an afterlife community He even gets a vampire as his guardian and mentor  There were people you could hug and then there was SilasGiven the Privilege of the Graveyard and taught how to Fade into the background Bod spends his entire childhood playing among graves learning his letters from the gravestones running into trouble with some ghouls being tutored by a werewolf with a taste for Eastern European food dancing with Death and making friends with the ghost of a young witch burned at stake He does crave human company though and in addition to becoming an imaginary friend of a little girl also does a brief stint as a nonsoordinary student at a school All this while the evil that tried to murder him in the first place is still searching for himNeil Gaiman has a real knack for the imaginative combination of sweet and creepy elements together with the bittersweet ending creating a unique and unforgettable story which appeals both to children and adults Told via a succession of interludes from Bods unusual life the story could have been overly sugary or overly morbid but Gaiman easily avoids either extreme This story has just the right mix of sweetness whimsy sadness suspense and adventures to keep the reader captivated throughout   Seeing the world depicted through the eyes of a quiet graveyardraised but very human boy colors the story with almost Bradburyesque feeling of nostalgia for the fleeting magic of childhood We see the inevitable process of growing up finding ones self and letting go of the comforts of childhood home written poignantly and sweetly and yet without overkill   Bod is a great character for a childrens story He is smart and resourceful quiet and observant loyal and brave somewhat mischievous and ultimately very lifelike His demeanor reminds me of my awesome younger brother actually Watching him grow up from a sweet child into what seems to be an actual good adult is a pleasure    This story even though wonderfully complete still reads almost like a tease at times Gaiman gives us a delightful and lyrical glimpse into the world which I would love to get to know better He creates such rich captivating characters that even after the book is over I am left longing for more I would love to read a whole another book dedicated to Silas or Miss Lupescu or Lizzy the witch Mr Gaiman if you ever run out of other book ideas just sayin stars and a wellearned spot on my for my future hypothetical daughter reading shelf      This is how it usually goes with me and Neil Gaiman booksScene at the libraryPicks up A couple months later At the libraryPicks up So I was a little hesitant to pick up The Graveyard Book Again the idea is interesting  a toddlers family is killed and hes raised in a graveyard by ghosts  but Gaimans books have seemed interesting to me before So its with gratitude that I sayFinally FINALLY To me this book at long last connected I loved the characters and the concept and the actual text seemed to flow and be more engaging than the previous books Id read Im glad I gave Gaimans books one more last chance after the last last chance I may even try one more   Ive got a doctors appointment scheduled for Monday Maybe Ill ask whats wrong with me I mean why dont I love Neil Gaiman as much as everyone else After all the hype surrounding him I finally gave in and started reading his books Aside from his collection of short stories Fragile Things I havent been as impressed as I expected to be The Graveyard Book in particular I found to be slow moving and depressing Maybe thats inevitable being that most of the characters in it are dead Its not that the writing isnt good Gaimans stories generally arent to blame either in fact there are some flashes of real ingenuity in some of them Coraline and Stardust have been standouts for me personally in this respect I have noticed that sometimes the scene description is lacking There have been moments in the middle of a page where Ive stopped and said wait where is this happening and when I look around all I see are a couple characters in a room about as decorative as the inside of this text block Im writing in right now But those arent common occurrences and theyre certainly not enough to sour the whole bookI dont know if the doctor cant help me maybe Ill seek a second opinion from the librarian    "},

"text": "The literary event of the season a new novel from Ian McEwan as surprising as it is masterful Michael Beard is a Nobel prizewinning physicist whose best work is behind him Trading on his reputation he speaks for enormous fees lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions and halfheartedly heads a governmentbacked initiative tackling global warming While he coasts along in his professional life Michaels personal life is another matter entirely His fifth marriage is crumbling under the weight of his infidelities But this time the tables are turned His wife is having an affair and Michael realizes he is still in love with her When Michaels personal and professional lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways an opportunity presents itself in the guise of an invitation to travel to New Mexico Here is a chance for him to extricate himself from his marital problems reinvigorate his career and very possibly save the world from environmental disaster Can a man who has made a mess of his life clean up the messes of humanity A complex novel that brilliantly traces the arc of one mans ambitions and selfdeceptions Solar is a startling witty and stylish new work from one of the worlds great writers ian mcewan hates you dear reader have no illusions the guy flings more shit and pukes more bile in solar than gg allin ever dared dream check it mcewan dazzles in select passages but the sum aint always more than its parts  which isnt necessarily a bad thing those perfect books with clearly defined themes succinct streamlined yuk you can have em we like the meandering messes shot to shit with all the baggage but at the end of the slop weve gotta feel something its gotta mean something so mcewan throws a lot at us but it aint enough picasso could impress with something he sketched while taking a shit and mcewan the best of his countrymen yup gimme mcewan over rushdie amis or barnes anyday offers up some great characterizations nice acerbic little observations on man in the world hes created for himself some great prose oh that prose this is one reader who kinda loathes those who worship at the altar of the perfect sentence and he readily admits to getting half wood when mcewan waxes poetic etc but solar above all else reeks of one thing fatigue yes mcewans writing about the same old bastard displaying the same old bad behavior all tangled up in the same old rigid story  it doesnt work dramatically or satirically and whatre we left with bullshit a rothmailerupdike caricature with not much to say for itself i challenge a reader to tell me what lies here other than a gratuitously pessimistic view of humanity lacking a morsel of insight or true emotion mcewans running on empty hes tired bitter angry its ugly sorry michelle   The novel is completed He has posted the bulky typescript to his publisher  oldfashioned he prefers this unnecessary gesture to the casual economy of emailing a PDF  and now he is free of the tormented inner voice telling him to reword rejig rewrite rethink He knows it is not as good as his earlier books which sometimes feel as though they were written by a near stranger by a person he only halfremembers being He has poured some of his confusion and disappointment into the novels central character along with other selfloathings his treacherous body his increasingly unreliable memory the stream of women who  God knows why  want to sleep with an aging still famous novelist and to whose insistent demands he occasionally acquiesces Against his better judgement he has taken a sideswipe at his own activities in trying to slow the inevitability of climate change cruelly satirizing the concerned group of likeminded writers who sometimes appear with him on latenight TV programs that few people watch He wonders if anybody will recognize himself but considers it improbable he has moved around the cards thoroughly enough that no one will spot the ladyHe tries not to think about the books many shortcomings The passages which laziness and failing imagination have made him haphazardly borrow from his own and other peoples writing an episode from Enduring Love with the focus slightly changed and Milton replacing Keats the polar bear theme from that Norwegian novel he read a few years ago a whole scene from Douglas Adams Even his timid editor reacted to that last one and with bad grace he has inserted an explanatory passage that puts him in the clear Oddly the thing he feels most distressed about is the letter from his physicist friend who has faithfully read every line and located a few errors Rest mass rather than resting mass And surely you mean Ricci tensor rather than Ricci scalar Ten minutes on Google show hes right but its too much trouble to call the publisher at this stage The worst part he thinks as he pours himself another glass of Macallan is that its good enough He has accumulated an army of loyal fans and they wont desert him at this late hour There is plenty of his trademark prose even if he sometimes lapses into telling rather than showing for pages at a time The opening is strong and will suck people in He has cleverly rearranged the timeline to create the necessary dramatic tension as the plot moves towards a climax as mechanical as that in the only explicit sex scene It will attract a few positive reviews who knows some of them may even be sincere Above all he knows its a pageturnerBut he still feels disgusted with his technical competence and he has marked that in one of the more bitterly selfreferential passages He rereads it and feels an obscure satisfaction Maybe a few other readers will also be amused for a momentHe took the bag in both hands and pulled its neck apart discharging a clammy fragrance of frying fat and vinegar It was an artful laboratory simulation of the corner fish and chip shop an enactment of fond memories and desire and nationhood That flag was a considered choice He lifted clear a single crisp between forefinger and thumb replaced the bag on the table and sat back He was a man to take his pleasures seriously The trick was to set the fragment on the centre of the tongue and after a moments spreading sensation push the potato up hard to shatter against the roof of the mouth His theory was that the rigid irregular surface caused tiny abrasions in the soft flesh into which salt and chemicals poured creating a mild and distinct pleasurepainHe pours a third glass   The main character in Solar cant control his appetites He eats like Jabba the Hut at a casino buffet drinks like an alcoholic fish and chases women every chance he gets Hes also an unorganized slob who would rather just travel or stay somewhere else rather than clean up his own living space On top of being greedy opportunistic selfish and lazy he has no regard for the future He can rationalize any potential warning signs of health issues or unpleasant business hed rather not deal with and just keep living exactly the way he always hasSound like any species you knowMichael Beard is an English physicist who once won a Nobel Prize and has been coasting off that accomplishment ever since Rather than do any more work in physics hes content to give lectures and take a series of figurehead jobs Hes also been married five times and has never been faithful to any of them but wife  Patrice has turned the tables by having an open affair with a workman doing repairs on their houseNaturally the selfabsorbed Beard wants what he cant have and becomes obsessed with winning Patrices love again Hes also taken a job as the titular head of an English think tank working on alternative energy sources and stopping global warming Beard believes in the science of climate change but he figures itll be somebody elses problem after hes dead so hes really only interested in the paycheck A zealous young researcher is driving him nuts by wanting to work on solar energy instead of the worthless wind turbine Beard has committed the institute to buildingA freak accident puts Beard in a position to claim credit for groundbreaking research and just maybe invent a whole new energy industry and save the world If he can put aside his greed and need for instant gratification long enough to make it workClever Mr McEwan Very clever Using a brilliant but lazy man who knows full well that hes courting disaster with his lifestyle and his actions but is just too weak willed to do anything about it as both a potential savior and symbolic destroyer of the world was a nice piece of work    So I imagine young novelists are a promiscuous bunch Writers play around and flirt with all manner of novels date one genre for a few months before finding it oppressive move in too quickly with a voice that turns out to be all wrong for them have onenight stands with forms that are way too experimental And Im sure its great fun for awhile but its not what theyre ultimately after No novelist wants to play the field forever And some do find that special novel early while for others it takes a lot longer time Some never do find it and remain lifelong bachelors which eventually does become a bit tragic a guy in his forties chatting up ironic twists on noir that are way too young for him but Im not talking about them the ones still out tomcatting around Im thinking about novelists who did find the OneIts the match theyve been searching for they settle down and buy a house The novelist and his novel are a symbiotic unit They socialize with other couples in the culdesac their kids all play together The novelists belong to the same club and their novels are close When the novelists take the train in together they ask after each others novel with whom theyre familiar old friendsAnd maybe it goes a little beyond that As happy as each novelist is with his novel after some time he cant help noticing how well the other novelists novel has kept itself up Maybe its all those pilates classes Theres something about the other novelists novels thick red hair and supermeta twist endings As the years go by the other novelists novel starts looking well sorry but novel Because while theres nothing like coming home to ones own novel each night the truth must be told that there is nothing quite like coming home to ones own novel each night and it could also be the truth that these novelists and their respective novels are in a bit of a rut and havent slept together in months You know how it isAll this endless babble anyone still there is to say that I finally figured out what went wrong with fiction this summer Ian McEwan and Martin Amis went to a key party They swapped novels and the results  while perhaps an invigorating experience for each middleaged novelist himself  were far from successful in this readers eyesFull disclosure Im only halfway through Solar right now and am on the fence about whether I should keep reading Any opinions on that I did manage to finish The Pregnant Widow Martin Amiss take on the McEwanesque themes of a bygone era and erotic longings but Im finding this one even less fun See youthful sex in an s Italian castle wouldve been great if McEwan were writing it But Amis isnt lyrical Worse though McEwan isnt funnyMichael Beard the Nobelprize winning physicist of Solar is a classic Amis antihero but with a lot of melted ice That is John Self of Money and Richard Tull of The Information are revolting losers who are driven into the ground by their appetites and too horrifically flawed to be real But McEwan cant pull off the biting stinging nausea thats Amiss sobaditsgood trademark He isnt funny  not to me anyway  and he just cant go gonzo This book has slapstick moments what I suppose was meant to be satire and plenty of scenes that should have been ludicrous But the volumes never up high enough and its all tempered by that patented lovelysentenced restraint The rather bloodless result is something that is not great the way I expect McEwan to be great to be fair Ive only read a couple of his books and certainly doesnt meet the searing demands of the topic hes chosen Martin Amis should be writing about climate change His take on human greed sloth and blind grabbing depravity is uniquely suited to this topic McEwans is not McEwan should be writing stuff like the scene in this book that describes landing at Heathrow but he shouldnt be writing a Martin Amis novel he also shouldnt be writing a Richard Powers novel but thats another rantAnd this really isnt the place to expand on this but to be fair the hollow ineffective and almost comically amateurish ending of The Pregnant Widow might be something McEwan wouldve handled brilliantly Your friend Ians rendition of Once in a Lifetime is inimitable Martin So sit down and watch and dont try it yourselfEnough of an experiment you married that novel for a reason Now go home to her boys and tell her you love her   I was reading in bed last nightI was a little more than halfway throughand it hit me it is taking way too long to read this thing Why Not because its a big book or particularly difficult to understand but because it is so boring I dread opening it each day so I put it off I read anything else I closed it and tossed it aside Im done Ill go find a new one tomorrow at the library Its really disappointing too because when I read the premise it sounded great But McEwan spends so much time on these little details that he forces unnaturally into metaphors that you find you are stuck reading about how the human race is like a healthy spore a few different times a few different ways That particular analogy by the way was pretty good until he pointed it out and forced me to see it rather than letting me come to the relationship on my own The main character is well developed but that doesnt make him any less boring Hes an old man who sucks at relationships and thats another thing we spend every few pages being told Does he do nothing other than think about his past marriages and how to screw up future ones Anyway yes I found this book to be a massive disappointment and must add it as my second book I couldnt finish How depressing is that   "},

epic proportions threatens to breakScary gripping and deeply unsettling American Gods takes a long hard look into the soul of America Youll be surprised by what  and who  it finds thereThis is the authors preferred text never before published in the UK and is about  words longer than the previous UK edition Anybody who tells you that the book is about old and new gods or about a man named Shadow or about coin tricks or about having ones head smashed in for losing a game of checkers is selling you a line because those are just details not the story itselfMuch like any Neil Gaiman story the devil is in the details and you just have to resolve yourself to coming along for the ride or youll miss it Its not one story or two its many and its all completeand you have to just read it and enjoy it and accept it Or just dont botherI might as well sell you a violin as sell this book to you or pluck a synopsis of it from behind your ear and then deposit it in my hand only to have it turn into a critical review while your attention is elsewhere But I wont youll just have to find the magic yourself   In  I walked away from my childhood religion  a high control some would say abusive group with a tiny little worldview and a severe superiority complex This was my realityI believed with all my being that the things depicted above were real and were just over the event horizon Leaving meant losing almost every friend I had ever made since childhood it created a rift with my still devout family and quite possibly saved my life Is it any wonder that fiction  alternate realities fantasy and mental escape  helped me make that decision helped me move on and helped deprogram my cultthink One fiction supplanted the other only this time I already knew I was working with stories Some of this fiction I had read many times not understanding why the stories resonated so strongly within me just knowing that I was compelled to return to those worlds over and over Others were stories I read during the time surrounding my breakaway and shortly thereafterAmerican Gods made me observe and think differently It gave me a new context for the mythologies I had accepted for most of my life It was bigger than the story of Shadow or the girl Sam or Czernabog For me it was about how we allow our Old Gods to define our present worldview and how we allow our New Gods to steal our awareness Our mythologies set the boundaries of our culture and paradoxically as our culture changes our gods sacrifice their immortality   The part of the story that affected me the most profoundly was the story of Hinzelmann and Lakeside The mixing of good and evil the blurring of lines townspeople looking the other way  to such a degree that it never occurs to them to see what is happening right under their noses Dead mens bones Deaths of legends It affected me to my core During the time I was reading American Gods it was this which rocked me  I was doing the same thing  choosing and keeping and killing my own Gods my own mythologies It was tremendously painful made a little easier by having the opportunity to process it within the bounds of somebody elses storyThe rest of the listDuneChapterhouse DuneFahrenheit Animal FarmSandmanCrisis of ConscienceUnder the Banner of HeavenSeductive Poison   Neil Gaiman must have British gonads of titanium to write a huge sprawling epic story about the nature of American belief Its a gamble that worked perfectly  since as he said Nobodys American  Not originally Thats my point the land which has become a melting pot to more than just people It also took in the beliefs they willingly or not brought with them to the New World embraced them changed them allowed some to flourish and others to nearly wither away It pitted the old gods not only against each other in the endless battle for survival but also against the new deities of consumerism and technology for the precious belief that keeps them going To quote Sir Pratchett again But the squabble among the old and new gods is just the surface The heart of Gaimans novel lies in portrayal  through seemingly unconnected interludes and sketches  of the people who brought the legends to this land brought them among blood and loss and sorrow and heartbreak of the people now who live in the this patchwork country that made a whole out of many little bits of their origins and pasts and of the soul of presentday America the glue that holds it togetherAnd to top it all off we are treated to the portrait of a seemingly idyllic very Stephen Kingesque small American town of Lakeside hiding its own dark deep secret Lakeview the quintessential American small town the stuff of legends as one may say Terrifying legends indeedDont be fooled into thinking the excon Shadow working for a mysterious Mr Wednesday whose real identity is not that hard to spot almost immediately is the protagonist No Shadow feels flat and underdeveloped simply because he is just our binoculars into the vast landscape of American mythology this world of belief and legends The imagery that Gaiman creates is stunning He paints a vivid picture with confident brush strokes creating an unforgettable literary landscape And he takes a gamble with the storyline and the plotting as well Do not look for exciting battles and confrontations for nonstop action or fastmoving plot This is the book unfolding slowly and finding its depth in the side stories and interludes that are there not to move the plot forward in the traditional sense but to give an extra glimpse an extra dimension to the unfolding epic picture stars for the unforgettable fascinating fullyimmersing experience Mr Gaiman if you want a title of an honorary American from this awestruck immigrant well  here it is   This is a tough review for me to write Im not exactly sure what it is about this book that I dont like Im not sure there even IS something I dont like Since I dont want to just leave you all with the ever popular Im just not that into it I will try to explainThis book has all the elements of a book I would enjoy The creepiness factor is up there the writing is brilliant the main character is a big lug I couldnt help but love Also I have always been fascinated by mythology so thats a plusShadow is our main character and he just got out of jail after doing his time of three years Right before he is supposed to be released he is let out early because his wife was killed in apparently scandalous circumstances The first ish pages were about the extent of where the book was interesting to me Shadow meets Wednesday and then the story turns into a bunch of mini stories and flashbacks and I didnt enjoy most of them Some were okay but the majority just felt like annoying disruptions and I felt myself thinking this is yet another longer book that could benefit from losing about  or so pages from the dragging middle Shadow is paid by Wednesday to be an errand boy while he travels America trying to rally his troops in preparation for a war between The old Gods and the new Gods media and money I guess its my own fault I couldnt really bring myself to care about this war between the new and old Gods because the Gods of Media and Money Not my GodsBooks that are hyped up as much as this one leave me in a place where I tend to get disappointed because its so hard to live up to those expectations Of course thats not the books fault but I was just expecting to like this book much more than I did I never felt engaged while reading this book and thats the reason I couldnt rate this above three stars I could appreciate the great writing and originality however so I couldnt give it below three starsThree stars it is folks but as most of you know this book is loved by almost all so of course I encourage everyone who is interested in this book already to read it and form your own opinions This book didnt do it for me but I am definitely going to try some of Gaimans other books and see if I have a better experience   Whenever we have a cold snap here in Wisconsin I find myself thinking about one of my favorite pieces of American Gods I remember reading it back in  or so This was back in the day Back when it was a bit of a secret that Gaiman lived in Wisconsin I read the following section of the book nodding to myself thinking Yup thats exactly what its like Then I had another thought I bet this comes from that really bad cold snap we had here in Wisconsin about six years ago It was pretty cool for me being able to guess where a this piece of this book got its start For those of you who havent read it heres the excerpt The main character Shadow has just come to a small Wisconsin town and he decides to walk into town to buy some warmer clothes and groceries    The cold snap had come that was for sure It could not be much above zero and it would not be a pleasant walk but he was certain he could make it into town without too much trouble What did Hinzelmann say last nighta tenminute walk And Shadow was a big man He would walk briskly and keep himself warm He set off south heading for the bridgeSoon he began to cough a dry thin cough as the bitterly cold air touched his lungs Soon his ears and face and lips hurt and then his feet hurt He thrust his ungloved hands deep into his coat pockets clenched his fingers together trying to find some warmth Step after step after step He glanced back The apartment building was not as far away as he had expectedThis walk he decided was a mistake But he was already three or four minutes from the apartment and the bridge over the lake was in sight It made as much sense to press on as to go home and then what Call a taxi on the dead phone Wait for spring He had no food in the apartment he reminded himselfHe kept walking revising his estimates of the temperature downward as he walked Minus ten Minus twenty Minus forty maybe that strange point on the thermometer when Celsius and Fahrenheit say the same thing Probably not that cold But then there was wind chill and the wind was now hard and steady and continuous blowing over the lake coming down from the Arctic across CanadaTen more minutes of walking he guessed and the bridge seemed to be no nearer He was too cold to shiver His eyes hurt This was not simply cold this was science fiction This was a story set on the dark side of Mercury back when they thought Mercury had a dark side This was somewhere out on rocky Pluto where the sun is just another star shining only a little more brightly in the darkness This thought Shadow is just a hair away from the places where air comes in buckets and pours just like beerThe occasional cars that roared past him seemed unreal spaceships little freezedried packages of metal and glass inhabited by people dressed more warmly than he was An old song his mother had loved Walking in a Winter Wonderland began to run through his head and he hummed it through closed lips kept pace to it as he walkedHe had lost all sensation in his feet He looked down at his black leather shoes at the thin cotton socks and began seriously to worry about frostbiteThis was beyond a joke This had moved beyond foolishness slipped over the line into genuine twentyfourkarat JesusChristIscrewedupbigtime territory His clothes might as well have been netting or lace the wind blew through him froze his bones and the marrow in his bones froze the lashes of his eyes froze the warm place under his balls which were retreating into his pelvic cavityKeep walking he told himself Keep walking I can stop and drink a pail of air when I get home  And that my friends is one of the many reasons I love Neil Gaiman    "},

"text": "Every week we pile our garbage on the curb and it disappearslike magic The reality is anything but of course Trashed Derf Backderfs followup to the critically acclaimed awardwinning international bestseller My Friend Dahmer is an ode to the crap job of all crap jobsgarbage collector Anyone who has ever been trapped in a soulsucking gig will relate to this tale Trashed follows the raucous escapades of three something friends as they clean the streets of pile after pile of stinking garbage while battling annoying smalltown bureaucrats bizarre townfolk sweltering summer heat and frigid winter storms Trashed is fiction but is inspired by Derfs own experiences as a garbageman Interspersed are nonfiction pages that detail what our garbage is and where it goes The answers will stun you Hop on the garbage truck named Betty and ride along with Derf on a journey into the vast secret world of garbage Trashed is a hilarious stomachchurning tale that will leave you laughing and wincing in disbelief This book is all about garbage  and its great Following up his excellent memoir My Friend Dahmer a book about actually going to school with cannibal serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer John Derf Backderf takes a look at the American trash industry in Trashed Part fiction part memoir Backderf was briefly a garbageman in  and part nonfiction the facts presented in this book are meticulously researched Trashed follows  year old JB through the four seasons learning the trade of trash collecting Its a juggling act between styles that Backderf manages really well A book that would just list facts about garbage would be too dry and one just about his experiences as a garbageman or the misadventures of the fictional JB would be a bit insubstantial But merged together Trashed is a very strong comic Through JB we see the horrors of being a garbageman maggots in bins bin soup dead cats headless deer diaper bombs when compacted you get flying shit yellow torpedoes plastic bottles of pee tossed out of car windows and the worst of the worst cheap bin bags that break leaving the garbageman to scoop up the trash with his armsTrashed is very informative and the reader will get a brief history of garbage through the ages how recycling works the biodegrading of various materials how trash trucks are designed how landfills operate and the landfills legacy on the ecological landscape These facts are seamlessly woven into JBs story as he encounters them eg when hes picking up dirty diapers there are facts on how many diapers Americans go through and how long theyll take to break down It IS a bit depressing in just how much garbage there is and how our culture has become more enamoured with throwing stuff out over the last few decades In fact Western economies seem built around the short lifespan of products with everyday devices intended to only last a few years before needing to be replaced But as gloomy as it may be its still a fascinating read Backderf makes the book palatable through our likeable everyman protagonist JB a young man disgusted with our societys garbage culture but who approaches it from a practical and light perspective Joining him are a colourful cast of characters like his perpetually pissedoff manager Wile E his flatmate the hipster Magee his colleagues Mike and Bone and Marv the far too old Village Dog Catcher There isnt too much of a plot as its mostly onthejob anecdotes though these are plenty as these episodes are interesting and bring home the variety of crap we throw out The fiction ties it all together even if it isnt a terribly gripping read Trashed is a very Americancentric book and while Backderf briefly mentions the various alternative methods of trash disposal used by Europeans who dont have the luxury of endless space like America I wouldve liked to have seen a wider look at the issue Backderfs conclusion at the end seems to be bigger landfills in remoter places like Alaska which seems a bit pointless when there are better methods out there than simply burying the problem Then again theres real money behind landfills so I guess Americans are stuck with the crap solution for nowA book about garbage doesnt seem the likeliest choice for a good read but Derf Backderf pulls it off in Trashed Its entertaining and a little sad but very revealing its one of the most memorable comics Ive read all year Definitely worth checking out   Technically this is impressive in alt comics style and listed as fiction though it is a mix of memoirpersonal experience as once Backderf worked in sanitation and nonfiction with some background based in research on trash Backdoor started this is as a memoir as was his My Friend Dahmer but he didnt have enough for a full length project so he shifted into fiction I seem to be in a minority here but I am not that into it I guess it is a cool enough portrait of a working class job though I didnt care that much for the characters really Its hard for me to catch the tone Its not that funny It doesnt tell me much that I didnt already know about American consumption and waste and trash piggery The art is great though and he is a talent in that respect this is his best work   Ive read Backderfs work since My Friend Dahmer but this is the first longform work hes published since the  book This is another wonderful book and for different reasons As the author makes clear in his introduction while this has roots in personal experiences Trashed is not autobiographical in nature as was My Friend Dahmer Hes written this instead as a work of fiction There are strains in the narrative that do seem to have autobiographic leanings or at least theres the feel of thatbut then again what work of fictional narrative doesnt have some links to the life experience What mitigates the fictional tone of the work are the informative factfilled sections that intersperse the story proper Its as if the protagonist  or Backderf himself  is momentarily stepping in to give us some data on garbage collection before getting back to the story of JBs experiences in his village service office These sections  citing EPA studies and other research  read more like memoir or documentary than fiction   What happens to your trash Who takes it away Where does it goFind out daring readerOkay so its not the most exciting topic in the world Its trash The stuff we dont want anymore But this book does a good job of mixing the factual stuff with the vignettes about smalltown lifeI wont tell you all the dirt on garbage but there IS a section in here that briefly mentions how Denmark uses new fancy incinerators that burn garbage to generate power and I was intriguedIt turns out that these are totally legit Burning garbage is potential method of getting rid of trash Granted the carbon emissions are a problem but I dont know how much worse that is than the way Americans dispose of their trash want to know more READ the bookWhats more interesting is that the incinerators have demonstrated that trash is more of a social problem than a scientific oneI read an article about Denmarks incinerators and it pointed out that there was a problem Not with the incinerators themselves but with the way that incineration to generate power deincentivizes waste reduction and recycling The incinerators require a certain amount of trash to run at maximum efficiency and so if I want to power my house this winter a certain number of bags need to hit the curb every week None of that stuff about the problems with the incinerators is in the book but it underscores the books message which is that the problem has a lot less to do with biodegradation and such and a lot more to do with the fact that we buy too much stuff it breaks too quickly and we toss it out and start overPeter   Once the scene was set I got into it The anecdotes were good and it was kinda a mix between Harvey Pekar and Bukowski if I can be so bold as to make two obnoxious references in one sentenceQuick tangentI wonder why it is that when I hear someone say Charles Bukowski is one of their favorite writers I instantly have an opinion of that person And that opinion is almost always Yeah thats what I thought I dont think its just about people who like Bukowski its about people who like him A LOT and cite him as a favorite author As a founding member of the Bad Dad Club I feel like this Bukowski love is an opinion often expressed by members of the Bad Dad Club Male and female by the way Dont get me wrong I really like a lot of his work It just seems that theres a certain type of person who really likes Bukowski and really needs you to know they really like Bukowski Someone in sciences needs to get into literature and start doing some studiesAnyway TrashedThe start was rough And I think its because the dialog was kinda clunky Stuff likeHey isnt that old man Jenkins Who runs the general storeYes it is And of course his wife is with him who we also knowTheres this thing I tried to express before in a review of a play about dialog and how it works and doesnt work and then I read this article about Mad Max Fury Road that crystallized the whole thing for meHeres what director George Miller says about dialog And he says it with the fancy ue ending as he would catalogue or egg nogueAt a simple level youre not trying to use dialogue as exposition youre using it as part of behaviour and language itself is distortedThank youue Dialog can be really grating as exposition and really effective as characterization Dialog tells you a lot not through the information contained in sentences but the language used and the way things are said I think this is especially true and noticeable in film plays and comics because they have the expository visual tools to carry some of the load as well so when dialog is used as exposition its extra painfulI was about to say that I give expository dialog in written stories a pass because pure prose doesnt have the visuals to rely on but that would be a lie I dont give anyone a pass on this I wont call Trashed lazy because its not lazy but when I write expository dialog its laziness Always Its a failure of imagination to show and demonstrate something in a better way And because its something Im sensitive to myself its something that sticks out for me in other works tooOh also this book has information about trash sprinkled throughout and this info confirms two longheld suspicions of mineRecycling dont do shit Seriously The amount of trash and especially the amount of toxic material in landfills is going to bite us in the ass And the way landfills are run doesnt help Garbage is compacted into large cubes which are stacked on each other and compressed and when its all said and done what theyve got is a huge pile of cubes buried in the ground and compressed so tightly and without air moving through and therefore biodegradation isnt really happening And whats more newer landfills are equipped with drainage for the toxic poisonous liquids that escape and in a recent test it was found that  of these systems leakedAlso children result in mounds of diapers Like huge And those dont biodegrade at all You could recycle your entire life and still not make up for those couple years of PampersThe problem has a lot less to do with lack of recycling than it does with consumerism and planned obsolescence Im not going to get all corporate warrior and shit but if you get rid of your phone because a newer version is out you are fucking up big time Those components are terrible for the environment they dont break down and the less of it we consume the less is manufactured Recycling is a drop in the bucket compared to consumer waste Now Im not a person who thinks that we shouldnt bother with something just because its small stakes It takes a lot of small changes to make a big change What Im saying is that you cant put out the green bin and be all Im a good steward of the environment and then throw a flatscreen in the dumpster the next dayGet products that last repair and refinish stuff when you can and just generally avoid throwing shit out Focus more on reducing the number of bags at the curb not where those bags are going  Europe is smart and America is dumbAgain Im not one of these assholes whos like If Trump becomes President Im moving to Sweden Because no Im not and you arent either Did you guys know that Denmark has fucking incinerators that generate heat and power From trashOkay there are some issues Not so much environmental like youd think but social People in Denmark recycle very little and are not incentivized to reduce waste because waste is what powers shit and screw it were good So there is a movement afoot to continue reducing waste and recycling even though these incinerators are kinda awesomeBut Ill say this Most waste in the US is shoved in the ground and poisons the area Wait lets back up Most waste is trucked to a facility where its then trucked via semi to a dump Goodbye to the local dump hello to the mega dump Which isnt the worst thing IMHO because there are some desolate parts of this state that nobody would miss But the problem as I see it is that were trucking around garbage Thats a crazy waste of resources To put that much time and effort into something were trying to get rid of is pretty crazySo while Denmark might not be totally in love with its incineration process its a fuck of a lot better than taking trash for a drive   "},
{"title": "The Last Lecture",

"author": "Randy Pausch",
"text": "We cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand  A lot of professors give talks titled The Last Lecture Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them And while they speak audiences cant help but mull the same question What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance If we had to vanish tomorrow what would we want as our legacy When Randy Pausch a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon was asked to give such a lecture he didnt have to imagine it as his last since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer But the lecture he gaveReally Achieving Your Childhood Dreamswasnt about dying It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles of enabling the dreams of others of seizing every moment because time is all you haveand you may find one day that you have less than you think It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe It was about In this book Randy Pausch has combined the humor inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form It is a book that will be shared for generations to come I sat down to write my review of The Last Lecture on Friday July th Before I started to write I decided to check Randy Pauschs website for any updates on his condition He had died that morning at the age of  The book and the lecture itself now take on new meaningFor those who arent aware Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students What would you say What wisdom would you impart What are your lessons in life For Randy this was not a hypothetical question Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced the elephant in the room advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months With this revelation out of the way he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others The lecture was so full of optimism clarity hope humour and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book The Last Lecture contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experienceLike the lecture the book is earnest and straightforward Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it He fills his stories with humour occasionally laugh out loud What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind Its hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author He seems like a great guy someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words This still comes across in the book although not as strongly as in the lecture In fact without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words reading the book can almost get a bit tiring I recall thinking on a number of occasions Ok we know that youre a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up you dont need to keep telling me Some of the advice in the book especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture can be a bit tough to swallow For example his advice to always carry  in cash in your wallet does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book Similarly he often speaks of the great mentors friends and supporters that he has had through his life not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their students careers Finally his advice to never give up Brick walls are not there to keep us out they are there so we can show how much we want something sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement He never says to expect something for nothing but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge Fortunately these moments are fairly rare and as long as you dont read the book in a single sitting which is quite possible then you probably wont feel too overwhelmedInterestingly shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far It is quite a difficult question to answer Im sure that I dont have the life experience to give a good enough answer but its quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book We need people like Randy who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in and that he thought others would benefit from hearing His life lecture book and his death remind me of a quote from Dr Howard Thurman Dont ask yourself what the world needs Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that Because what the world needs is people who have come alive Even as he lived the last few months of his life I know that Randy was truly alive   My review of this book will not be popular but I must be honest Im halfway through this book and although I appreciate a positive voice its really not that interesting or helpful If I could sum up this book in three words they would be yay for me The author tells us how great his childhood was then that he accomplished all his childhood dreams got the girl of his dreamsetc etc etc Its really not a book how to better your own life as much as it him telling us how great his life has been Yes I realize it was born from a lecture but maybe every life achievement and event in this world doesnt necessarily need a book to be made about themHaving said all negative stuff Mr Pausch sounds like a good guy   While this man has a star attitude I can only give the book two yeah everyone is raving about this guy Five star attitude the author gets diagnosed with terminal cancer He refers to this as an engineering problem understated and true has  months to live tops Has  small children ages  and underwho will never know him he was scheduled to give a last lecture ya know how to live your life as if you were dying irony and he writes it in such a way that its a celebration of his life his children will know who he was and what he believed in a story of how life can throw brick walls in your way and you have a choice to stop or go around them play the cards you get dealt instead of bitching about themI applaud the great attitude he takes to enjoy the time he has left and focus on what matters But is this earth shattering Is any of this a surprise   I was first introduced to Mr Pausch while watching the Oprah show in the fall My father in law was in the hospital at the time fighting melanoma that had metastacized to his lungs Simply stated I stopped folding clothes and cried so hard during that show Soon after the emails began to circulate with links to the last lecture on utube and I watched every link I got and cried even more I read all the internet articles and was touched every time When I saw the book was coming out I jumped on board and knew I had to read it I never knew how emotional this book would be for me The day August   Randy Pausch got the devistating news that his cancer had spread and there was nothing the doctors could do anymore is the same day that we arrived at MD Anderson with my father in law knowing things were not right I came across this in the book and had to put it down for days This was just hitting too close to home for me I finally was able to pick it back up and continue This book and Mr Pauschs stories are so touching and true that we can all find something in there that will help us want to be a better person We can all find some bit of wisdom that can be carried into our lives I cried so many times reading this but I laughed several times too Anyone who has had their life touched by cancer will benefit from the optimism Mr Pausch has but it will be a very difficult read just because of the seriousness of the issues at hand Just the sheer optimism in such a negative world is very upliftingI ran across several quotes from the book that I felt were so important that I needed to use my trusty post it notes to mark them for future reference Here they are Pg  The brick walls are there for a reason Theyre not there to keep us out The brink walls are there to give us a chance to how how badly we want something Mr Pausch refers to the brick walls so many times but it is so truepg Time is all you have And you may find one day that you have less than you think This has been a major realization in my life this past year We thought we had so much time with my father in law And we lost him so quickly Take the time to do the things you want and never put them offpg  Luck is indeed where preparation meets opportunity This goes back to my old Girl Scout motto Be preparedpg Experience is what you get when you didnt get what you wanted Glad to know Ive gotten something And now it makes sensepg A lot of people want a shortcut I find the best shortcut is the long way which is basically two words work hard Wow If we could all stop taking the shortcuts and work a little harder could imagine what might happenpg All you have is what you bring with you This is the chapter title and it sure says a lot   I think this was one of those books where knowing the criticisms before starting it ultimately upped my enjoyment factor Randy Pausch the author was one of those people who became wildly popular in  thanks to the internet He was a popular professor at Carnegie Mellon and was invited to give a last lecture a tradition of sorts where a professor is urged to give a specially prepared lecture as though it were the last she were to ever give And so they are encouraged to break down all the knowledge learned in their lives and during their careers into one hourlong presentation and say this is the best of what I know here you go But for Randy Pausch his Last Lecture became somewhat of a sensation because shortly before he was scheduled to give his presentation he learned that he had latestage pancreatic cancer and he only had  months left to live Throughout it all he remained very upbeat he was charismatic and his nerdy persona was infectious And so copies of the lecture spread and spread and spread over the internet and suddenly Pausch was an overnight sensation Only in America Given his shortened life span at the time of publication I can understand why the book felt so rushed There are some chapters that are little more than a couple paragraphs with a random anecdote that doesnt really have anything to do with anything And many of the longer ones appear to be runons About halfway through the book I realized that each chapter of this book reminded me of a blog entry Then I realized that that may be some of the appeal to this generation because as a piece of literature this book is justwellno This book came highly recommended to me by my sister and my mom who love it My motherinlaw has read this book and also loves it And at the time I write this review  star and star reviews on GR and there are fewer than  ratings that are  stars or less so Pauschs story has clearly touched the lives of a lot of people Since discovering this site I almost always scan some of the topvotegetting reviews before starting a book Whether someone loved it or hated it Im always curious to know why And in the case of this book since there were so many glowing reviews I found myself focusing on the negative ones if only because they appeared to be in the minority and the minority has always intrigued me Most of the complaints had to do withthe fact that Pausch sucks as an authorPauschs personalitywhat did this guy do so differently that he actually deserved a bookthe book is too preachyits too Hallmarkyits too DisneySo going into the book expecting these faults I found myself focusing on what is probably the most important thing about this book Randy Pausch who isnt alive anymore had three children under the age of five who may not remember that once upon a time he was their father who loved them very much And realizing that this year next year five    years from now his children will still have a record of who he was and what he stood for whether I agree with all of it or not is an unbelievably beautiful thing My husband was a teenager when his mother died unexpectedly and years later we still have items in our home that belonged to her a set of watercolor paintings shed had since college a handwritten recipe on a postit note a baby book full of handwritten notes and stories and photographs Having that connection to the past is a tangible reminder not only of what was lost but of where we come from And losing a parent before their time makes that connection even more powerful And so I cant help but feel glad and happy for Randy Pauschs children because they will grow up knowing that their dads life inspired so many millions of people I hope that will be a tremendous source of pride for them They cant have their dad but the legacy he left them was the best he had to offer in the short amount of time he was given to work with    "},

"author": "Robert Ludlum",
"text": "   Re enter the shadowy world of Jason Bourne an expert assassin still plagued by the splintered nightmares of his former life This time the stakes are higher than ever For someone else has taken on the Bourne identitya ruthless killer who must be stopped or the world will pay a devastating price To succeed the real Jason Bourne must maneuver through the dangerous labyrinth of international espionagean exotic world filled with CIA plots turncoat agents and evershifting alliancesall the while hoping to find the truth behind his haunted memories and the answers to his own fragmented past This time there are two Bournesand one must die  in the Bourne trilogy This book didnt have some of the elements that made the first one so great but it had a few things that werent there in the first book that I liked namely the distinct seperation of David Webb the mild mannered husband and Jason Bourne the highly trained killing machine who cares for nothing but himself Ludlum actually creates three different characters in the same body David Webb Jason Bourne and Delta Webbs codename during his time as a heartless American guerrilla fighter in earlys VietnamThe story sarts with  who has Webb had  years of peace and therapy and has mostly put his past as the psuedoassassin Jason Bourne and his chaotic years in Vietnam behind him Suddenly he is plunged back into the covert ops world that he has been trying to forget This time allied with his once enemy and long time friend Alex Conklin no he doesnt die in the first book like in the movies he must fly to Asia and kill a new assassin who is using the name of Jason Bourne What I liked most about this book was the inner struggle between Webb and Bourne Webb is weak and slow but he is capable of emotions like love and empathy Bourne on the other hand is a void of emotions with the exception of hate and anger and is highly effective for it As the story goes on you see less and less of Webb and more of Bourne By the end Webb is virtually gone and Bournes anger and hate gives way to Delta who was the origianl killer a persona so filled with rage at losing his first family during Vietnam that he joined an American guerrilla force just to be able to kill This part of the story kept me enthralled through the entire book Also in this book you see Bourne as a hunter and not running for his life He appears more clever and deft in this book than in the first The cons in this book were about the same as the first The characters talked way too much and it felt like they kept going on tangents that werent really important to the story And Webb and Marie reached whole new levels of romantic barfness during this book But overall  I still loved this one It wasnt quite as complex as the first book but there was more action in it It was more of an inyourface kinda action suspense book but it came off great I recommend it to anyone   Well this was the worst book Ive read in a long time Where to start Its bloated racist and dull The scenery is a bit interesting and the plot from the first hundred pages or so appeared just convoluted enough that I wanted to see what happened in the end or I would have been done with this book by the end of half an hour But I soldiered onIn the end the book was far less interesting than the Bourne Identity perhaps because there was less for Bourne to do as the man being manipulated rather than manipulating everyone else Characters also really suffered here Bournes internal conflict was just a throwback to the previous novel and we waste approximately  pages on his split personality ramblings Marie was far less formidable than in Identity Really only one character emerged in this book who was genuinely interesting Echo Philippe dAnjou returns from the previous novel seemingly a different character this time around more of a magnificent old commando bastard and mentor figure Alexander Conklin also gets some magnificent old CIA bastard screentime This was worthwhileAs for Ludlums take on Asia Asians and Asian politics the term facepalm seems most appropriate Nearly every Asian character is a stock stereotype Bribe the avaricious Chinese is basically the main way the plot moves forward Oriental is a frequent noun theres racist language and all the characters involved in political plotting on the Chinese side are fanatics inspired by the Cultural Revolution Oh and theres a kung fu sidekick who teams up with Bourne after he is defeated obviouslyFinally as a Canadian I was annoyed by Ludlums basic failure of continuity from the first book and massive factual errors Calgary is not in Ontario Calgary is really not in OntarioIf I owned this book as a physical object rather than a digital file I could have chucked it against a wall But that would break my Kindle What a pity   First and foremost this book has absolutely nothing to do with the movies that recently came out Sure they share the same title but let me reassure you they have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the movie The only thing that is kept from the book and transferred into the movie is the fact that Bourne is killers killer if you dont believe me just watch the movie He kills a man with a TOWEL All that being said I found this to be a quite enjoyable book It takes place in China Apparently someone has taken up the Jason Bourne monniker and started assassinating Triad members The real Jason Bourne whose real name is David Webb is to say the least furious and this fury is further fueled by the kidnapping of his wife Marie After that David Webb goes back to being Bourne in order to find his wife and to kill the man who is impersonating him I really enjoyed this book because it keeps the sense of action that movies have It also is really suspenseful and keeps you glued to the page I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys espionage novels   My first thought will give you an idea of how this book reads I am so happy to be done with it The plot is terribly complex and if you are clueless about the Far EastChina and try to follow it good luck to you The book and the movie are not similar and this is one of the rare instances where I found the movie better than the book In the movie his wife is killed right away Not so in the book The wife annoyed me to no end Heres what I thought of thatAs for the economic genius Marie St Jacques I find it astounding that to conceal her appearance all she has to do is  push back her gorgeous red hair  not wear makeup  wear flats instead of heels  not wear form fitting clothing Wow  instantly unrecognizable So I guess she normally has a red Afro wears clown makeup  inch heels and a body suit You know a man is writing this If Marie is so smart then why do her stupid clues not work with Bourne but alert McAllister And my God could she be more obvious Maple tree Shes Canadian for Petes sake Finally I liked Bourne and DAnjou working together It reminded me of Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobe    That difficult middle book in a trilogy This time Bourne is tricked into heading to Hong Kong to track down his kidnapped wife Except its all a government plot to get him to assassinate a rogue Chinese leader who is threatening the stability of the regionA frantic chase across the US China and Hong Kong Involving the Chinese American and British secret services This book was pretty

good one in this excellent cozy mysteries series set in Medieval England in Shrewsbury near the border to Wales My next one will be Monks Hood It feels repetitive to write another review please see instead these two reviewshttpwwwgoodreadscombookshow for The Leper of Saint Giles and httpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshow for St Peters FairI highly recommend the series They do NOT have to be read in order except  and  have to be read before  say my friends The first one is not one of the best so beware Dont be put off if you insist on starting there You get delightful writing and a clear mystery that is fun to follow and filled with action The monks are great characters each with their own particular idiosyncrasies They become real people because in all the books their character doesnt change so the more you read the more you enjoy going back to meet them again Some are nicer than others so dont think this is totally unrealistic These characters are more than nice versus bad they are unique individuals one LOVES anything to do with music another has a good heart but always breaks things and makes messes and then of course there is Brother Cadfael pronounced Cadfile He is Welsh worldly has fought in wars been to the Holy Lands and now has returned and fills out his monastical duties working in the Abbys herbarium and solving crimes Oh I forgot I was going to keep this very short My advice dont start with book one Start with my favorite so far The Leper of St Giles The Sanctuary Sparrow is almost as good but the mystery was a teeny bit harder to follow As usual all the threads tie up nicely As usual Brother Cadfael explains how he thinks for us the Deputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar and the Abbot As usual the writing is NOT salacious but lovely As usual the crime gets solved and each get their fair due in one way or another You recognize a lovely constancy to how the stories unfold and are resolved Lovely series I just couldnt keep my mouth shut could IThe narration of the audiobook by Vanessa Benjamin was absolutely wonderful No complaints whatsoever   In this one of my favorite Brother Cadfael stories and also the first one I read long ago on a trip to Britain attention again returns to the roles and lives of medieval women but this time the focus is on the middle and lower classes From the dramatic opening when the peace of the monks nightly office is shattered by a mob from the town pursuing a ragged traveling entertainer accused of murder to the even more dramatic climax this Brother Cadfael will keep you turning the pages and then being sorry when its done and wanting moreBrother Cadfael pronounced Cadfile has definitely entered the ranks of great fiction detectives alongside Sherlock Holmes and Lord Peter Wimsey But these stories are more than just murder mysteries in medieval drag Ellis Peters actually lived in Shrewsbury England where Cadfaels monastery of St Peter and Paul can still be visited Her knowledge of the land and people and history permeates her work and gives her the incredible gift of transporting her reader into the past You really do feel as though you are in that longlost world lit only by fire where its quiet and green and life moves at a pace most people can be happy inCadfael is a suitably complex man Hes from Wales but now living in England though Wales is not very far away He was once a soldier but now hes a monk Hes lived a full life now he wants to be quiet But he also has a strong sense of right and justice and refuses to compromise on these things even when it means getting himself in trouble Hes also picked up a lot of knowledge especially of herbology and medicine and somehow for the time logical analysis that stands him in good stead as a solver of mysteriesAnother charming step along the journey of Cadfael   Ive come late to the Cadfael series having first watched the television adaptations starring the magnificent Sir Derek Jacobi Though this is the seventh in the Cadfael series it was the first I read since this particular adaptation was probably my favourite Peters has an amazing eye for historical detail and her knowledge of such varied things as botany criminology psychology and the human heart is as impressive as it is extensive Brother Cadfael is a medieval Gil Grissom in a habit but with more humanity and emotion than that modern counterpart The religious aspect of the novel is never heavyhanded or overpowering every character  even the minors  is three dimensional and believable and the love stories at the heart of the mystery will pull at your heartstrings in an entirely sincere fashionA wonderful read for anyone whos interested in history Medieval Britain mystery and the television adaptationsA in my book Ms Peters Brava   Ellis Peters again delivers a wonderful historical mystery Brother Caedfael often helps people in love In this book there are three couples each couple very much in love but in three very different ways The action of the story comes about naturally from who each person is and comes to light just as naturally Ms Peters does seem prone to the trope of the first suspect is never guilty but I hadnt realized it until just now She doesnt beat you over the head with it Frankly by about half way through this novel I had at least three different theories about who did what and why all of them supported by the facts revealed that far And had I not been so very caught up in the excellent writing and the wonderfully real characters I could have figured it out  all the information was there But I preferred to stay immersed in the time and place of the story than take the time to work out the plot ahead of time    The Brother Cadfael books are always enjoyable The characters are great and her descriptions of scenes make everything real and bring you back to th Century England In this book a young jongleur has managed to make his way to sanctuary just in time to avoid being lynched by a mob of villagers who are certain he murdered and robbed his employer As always there are so many more underlying stories and Brother Cadfael is instrumental in solving the mystery and bringing peace to the lives of all involved Its always a pleasure to visit with Brother Cadfael    "},

Gobi desert from Siberia to Thailand then transported by boat to complete her hike at her favorite tree in AustraliaRelying on hunting and her own wits Sarah Marquis made it across six countries where she survived mafia drug dealers thieves on horseback who harassed her tent every night for weeks temperatures from sub zero to scorching lifethreatening wildlife a dengue fever delirium in the Laos jungle tropic ringworm in northern Thailand dehydration and a lifethreatening abscessThrough an incredible journey Wild By Nature explores what it is to adventure as a woman in the most dangerous of circumstance what it is to be truly alone in the wild and why someone would challenge themselves with an expedition others would call crazy Originally a bestseller in France selling over  copies Wild By Nature will appeal to fans of Cheryl Strayeds Wild Wild by Nature is the account of the  mile hike that Sarah Marquis made across Mongolia China Siberia Laos Thailand before a journey on a cargo ship and then a further walk across the Australian Outback Whilst she had backup and sponsors Sarah undertook this walk solo Not only is this a huge physical achievement she had to stay sharp whilst facing thieves drug dealers tropical diseases lethal wildlife life threatening illnesses and natives who were not always best pleased to see a foreigner She had to cope with freezing temperatures in the Gobi desert scorching temperatures in the Australian deserts being blasted by the winds on the Mongolian Steppe and survived some unbelievable thunderstorms It is quite an challenge for anyone to undertake but for a single woman in some of these countries it is even more of a trial This is not her only achievement wither she has walked  countries in total earning herself the National Geographics title of Adventurer of the Year She is tenacious and stubborn two qualities that you need to push yourself to the physical and mental limits that a walk like this demands but there are times even for her when it all seems too much But I think that there are a few things that let it down a little one is that her journey seems to jump around somewhat without following any logical route I would expect a journey of this type to flow nicely but it doesnt You got a good sense of her emotional highs and lows but it was also difficult to connect to her as a reader at times This is one worth reading if you like walking books but could have been much better   Let me start by saying that Im a self confessed armchair adventurer With the likes of Ed Viesturs Ive gone up K With George Grinnell Ive witnessed travesty unfold on the barrens of Canada and with Tabor Ive descended amazingly deep within the bowels of the earth Ive also walked with woman hikers Jennifer Pharr Davis in CALLED AGAIN and Patricia Herr in PEAK BAGGING and Cheryl Strayeds WILD just to name a fewAnd I mention all these titles for two reasons One to let you know what literature is out there if you are just getting started with your own armchair adventuring and two to show that I have a fairly good grasp of what the literature looks like Which is to say that I almost know what Im talking aboutSo WILD BY NATUREThe first thing I noticed was that you can tell that an American didnt write this book The author is Swiss I believe and speaks French Certainly her sentence structure and thought processes seem European to me So that was not lost in converting this book to English Her world view though is different and that took some getting used to The second thing I noticed and which is of a lot more importance is that the book is not written like a diary or a reconstruction of a story based on a diary Its more remote like she had no written record to call upon and maybe thats why I never felt like I was there with her When I climbed with Viesturs I felt the cold and the lack of oxygen I didnt feel the  degree heat of MongoliaAnd what is more distressing than the lack of immediacy is that the author has edited out thoughts and actions A perfect example of this is the scary night visits she experienced when in Mongolia For some reason men on horseback would show in the middle of the night at her camps no matter how hard she had tried to stay hidden We are told about these strange and frightening occurrences but only in the vaguest terms Not what the men said or did or how she reacted to them When did they go away What did they want She doesnt tell us Which Im afraid is a cheat and not the way to go about writing this sort of thing up imho If theres something you dont want to address then for heavens sake dont bring it up Its not like well know the differenceWhich brings my third and final point to the fore Theres some jumpiness in the telling Im used to reading the diaries of settlers so Im comfortable with jumps in time in that format But as I said this isnt a diary so the jumps are a little strange and unwelcome And perhaps this ties into some of the continuity problems One example is where she tells us her personal philosophy is to never stay in one spot for more than one night unless it is an absolute emergency Then a couple of pages later she stops for  days and has a nice rest with a tour guide She then tells us that she plans to ask him why the Mongolians are behaving in such an unexplained fashion  women taking off their tops when in her presence and the men appearing in the middle of the night She and the tour guide have a good laugh over these questions but we arent let in on the answers WHAT DO I REALLY THINK  I think this book has features of interest but that its going to frustrate quite a few reviewers One should definitely read a sample chapter before purchasing   I really enjoyed Sarah Marquiss Wild by Nature One Woman One Trek One Thousand Nights I would love to go on an adventure like this Unfortunately I am too neurotic for such a trip I dont know how I would have reacted in many of the situations the author found herself in such as when the horsemen kept visitingstalking her encampment at night The author kept her composure much better than I would have Ms Marquis also crossed several arid regions and thats a big nono for me Heat and I do not get along well one of the reasons I live in North Dakota She certainly has staminaI enjoyed the travel diary layout of the book as well as the illustrated maps that show the path of her trek There is also a lot of useful advice in this book for those who may venture out onto an overseas adventure such as some of the tips for finding water as well as the Chinese sign language numbers About the only beef I have with the book is that for the first few chapters about one out of every ten pages did not print correctly and there is a vertical line down the middle of the pages where the text did not print Most of the words are easy to figure out but others are not Other than that the book is an easy quick read and I would recommend it to people who enjoy travel adventures and memoirs I obtained my copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway and I appreciate the opportunity to read and review it   I think any review of this book needs to start with acknowledging and celebrating that Sarah Marquis is an absolutely phenomenal woman a force of nature herself She has an iron will and no fear Situations that would be difficult under normal circumstancessuch as having an abscessed tooth or dengue feverand lay your average white collar worker out for a week she handles while camping in the jungle alone The second she recovers shes up walking again She seeks out the harshest environments possiblethe Gobi desert Southeast Asian jungle the Australian outbackwith aplomb Lets be clear she hiked from Mongolia to the bottom edge of Australia It took  years Even the last leg of her journey  kilometers through Southern Australia a short distance relative to her entire trip seems impossibly long to someone like me who gets winded and tired after hiking for just  or  miles Her story is absolutely wild So really my lack of enthusiasm for this book has nothing to do with Marquis herself She seems a little quirky opinionated and even a bit arrogant especially when she talks about the people of Mongolia China and Australia that she encounters However she has a right to be arrogant Shes accomplished so much She has a right to her quirks such as her staunch vegetarianism on ethical groundsif anyone proves by example that you can be healthy as a vegetarian she can I say more power to her As for her judgments of the people she encounters at some points I did feel it was a little unjustified If youre a stranger traveling through a strange land its important to be respectful and open to different customs and traditions than what youre used to On the other hand I do not feel that she is racist or prejudiced in any way Some of the people she talks smack about actually suck as people For instance an old lady sabotaged her campsite out of what seemed like simple spite many of the men she encountered seemed ready to rape her or assault her for absolutely no reason she had to deal with theft and no one trusting her and customs officials and shady characters always seemed ready to hold her up or deny her entry into their turf for no reason It sounded pretty rough and its sad that some people are so xenophobic they cant deal with a woman traveling on foot alone through their country I understand when people feel annoyed with tourists who are loud in the way destructive disrespectful etc but Sarah Marquis was none of those things at all times it seemed like all she wanted was to avoid people and leave as little impact as possible environmental or otherwise So I understand the frustration she expresses No my issue with this book is the writing I heard a great interview with Sarah Marquis on NPRs On Point with Tom Ashbrook and honestly I would suggest listening to that or reading one of the many interviews with her or writings about her travels she was sponsored by National Geographic Im sure they have lots of fascinating material about her trips instead of reading this book Maybe its the translation maybe its the fact that its ghostwritten Im not entirely sure It reads more like an outline than a finished book For the uniqueness of the subject matter I was surprised by how boring I found it Certain instances that seem like they could have been a short essay in and of themselves were summed up in scant sentences Even though you understand that Sarah Marquis has a strong deeply emotional connection to nature walking and this trip it doesnt come through in the writing I have to compare it to other walking books that I really enjoyBill Brysons A Walk in the Woods and Cheryl Strayeds Wild Even though both authors walked far shorter distances than Marquis Bill Bryson didnt even walk the entire Appalachian Trail before writing his book both of those books carry more emotional weight interest insight and just overall better storytelling than Wild by Nature Brysons book had more humor and a better flow He supplied a lot of history of the trail but made it very interesting He sketched out some of the travelers he encountered in hilarious detail whereas Marquis might just sum up an encounter with a stranger in a few words and move on leaving you wondering what just happened or why the person was mentioned at all As for Cheryl Strayeds book some might say that it verges too much into sentimental emotional material It deals heavily with her loss of her mother to cancer which topically seems unrelated to hiking But for me she really made it work mirroring her journey through grief to her physical journey across the Pacific Crest Trail She also delved into her own faults and past mistakes in great detail She described the trail with a great sense of wonder and at times her story got very tense Once again better storytelling than in Wild by Nature made Strayeds book for me much more gripping At the end of Wild and A Walk in the Woods I felt that I had been on a journey with the authors that I knew something personal about what these trips meant to them With Wild by Nature I felt as though the physical steps of the journey had been described to me stopping to camp recovering from illnesses encountering potentially dangerous people and wildlife etc but a story had not been told There was not enough detail to feel entrenched in the trip in what it must have been like to travel through such perilous territory alone So in the end even though Sarah Marquis may be the most adventurous brave traveler with the most to show for her efforts Wild by Nature didnt reflect that   ARC provided by Allen  Unwin A new adventure has been chronicled for all readers who find enjoyment in seeing the world through a wandering explorers eyesSarah Marquis spent three years from  traversing through incredibly harsh environmental conditions from the despairing heat of the Mongolian Gobi Desert to Siberia Thailand and the great Australian outbackShe was recently applauded for her global treks by being named National Geographic Explorer of the Year in  and has a number of published books behind her but most of them nonEnglishWild by Nature unlike other adventuresome memoirs is not retold in the form of a personal journal instead it is written much like a novel and although Marquis shares her life experiences of stamina and adaptability the book read slightly jagged with its short and sharp sentence structure and felt slightly disconnected with references to other expeditions over the course of her lifetimeIt almost felt like her adventure didnt translate well onto the pageChapters went from one expedition to the next and it was difficult at times to grasp where on the spectrum the reader was until a few paragraphs inBut Marquis has more than  years of experience and although much of her preparation isnt delved into readers will however appreciate the fact she was a woman alone in the middle of nowhere and conquering her surroundingsTo learn of Marquis and her love of walking through unknown territory is real to learn of what she came across is real and that is what readers will enjoy the most Her passion is astounding and to know she has conquered such an amazing feat is astoundingFor those readers not interested in sentence structure timeline or what it takes to prepare for such an adventure this is a wonderful read You can certainly get lost and absorbed into Marquis world and feel motivated to start your own expedition   "},
{"title": "The Children of Hrin",
"isbn": "0007246226",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "It is a legendary time long before The Lord of the Rings and Morgoth the first Dark Lord dwells in the vast fortress of Angband in the North and within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the war waged by Morgoth against the Elves the fates of Trin and his sister Ninor will be tragically entwinedTheir brief and passionate lives are dominated by the elemental hatred that Morgoth bears them as the children of Hrin the man who dared to defy him to his face Against them Morgoth sends his most formidable servant Glaurung a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire in an attempt to fulfil the curse of Morgoth and destroy the children of HrinBegun by JRR Tolkien at the end of the First World War The Children of Hrin became the dominant story in his later work on Middleearth But he could not bring it to a final and finished form In this book Christopher Tolkien has constructed after long study of the manuscripts a coherent narrative without any editorial invention It has been said that all good things must come to an end In this case the end of Children of Hurin also marks the end of my quest to read a book by each of my five favorite authors It seems like a fitting way to end this journey in that Tolkien is the oldest of my favorites and if there was ever a modern author suited to endofquest tales it was Tolkien He was also the author on my list that gave me the greatest concernnot only has he passed away but his body of published work is relatively small I didnt want to reread the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings not because I dont love them but because I wanted to be able to read something new just as I had with the other authors Having read the Silmarillion several months earlier I was hard pressed to think of what else to read Sure I could have gone for Letters From Father Christmas or Farmer Giles of Ham but neither of those somehow felt right Tolkiens tales of MiddleEarth were what cemented him as one of my favorite writers and I wanted to go back to MiddleEarth as part of this projectFortunately the publishing gods smiled upon me and gave me Children of Hurin This is another in a line of books composed by Tolkiens estate taken from various notes fragments and other unfinished writings and molded into a coherent whole In that respect for the record its very well done The text flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter and I never once had the sense that I was reading something out of place or inauthentic This feels like Tolkiens writing and if it isnt exactly what he intended I have to believe its pretty damn closeBut what of the story itselfThe story of Hurin and his offspring is told as part of the Silmarillion but not in the detail that Tolkien intended Tolkien believed that this story was one that could be told apart from the Silmarillion as a wholethat it was strong enough and vibrant enough to stand on its own And he is absolutely correctChildren of Hurin is an epic Its also a tragedy If you come into this book expecting glorious battles and happy endings you will be sorely disappointed though if you come to Tolkien expecting nothing but happiness and light I submit you havent read Tolkien very often or carefully This is not a tale of good triumphing over evil but a tale of a family brought down by an epic curse More Macbeth than Star Wars in other wordsThe writing itself is epicChildren of Hurin reads a lot like Beowulf or the Iliad Tolkien apparently originally tried to write the tale as an actual epic poem but was never quite able to make it work Still his prose captures that same spirit rhythm and cadence As a huge fan of epic and epic poem I love itDespite the epic prose and tragic scope the characters of Children of Hurin are very well crafted and ultimately very human Their actions while not always rational are often understandable and while the tragedy has its origins in the supernatural it is Morgoth who curses the line of Hurin there is not a strong sense that the plot is forced simply by supernatural means Instead we get the sense that these are perhaps well meaning but ultimately deeply flawed people who suffer for their choices and the choices of others The final scene of the book when Hurin is finally reunited with his dying wife is absolutely heartbreakingTheres also a wonderful scene much earlier which really stuck with me and I need to mention it here just because its so wonderfully crafted It occurs shortly after Hurins capture by Morgoth when Morwen his wife is trying to figure out what to do with herself and her children Turin the son says something to the effect of I know my father is dead He must be because I know that his love for us is so strong that if he were alive no chains could hold him and no amount of enemies could keep him from returning to usAnd Morwens answer is I do not think either of those things is true my sonIts a wonderful if completely heartbreaking moment where a childlike view of heroism clashes completely with the harsh realities of the world It strikes me as a very Tolkienesque moment in many ways much of Tolkiens work deals with the interplay between heroics and the personal cost or realities of those heroics At least thats my initial thought In any case its an immensely powerful sceneThe text of the book is aided by the wonderful illustrations done by Alan Lee who has done a lot of Tolkienrelated art in the past His illustrations are interspersed in no particular order throughout the book but each one of them is gorgeous and really adds to the flavor of the text It would have been neat to see some more of themThis is yet another Tolkien book Ill be rereading in the future Its a fine addition to the Middle Earth canon   As a general rule I try to write my reviews in a vacuum as much as possible that is before I read through the other reviews already here I am not going to be able to do that here I have spent more than twenty years with this story since my mother first read the Unfinished Tales version aloud to me when I was eight years old and if Christopher Tolkien had not put this volume together I might have eventually had the hubris to do so myself Let me start by making a couple of points First this is not a new book in any sense of the word other than it is now standing on its own between two covers and without visible editorial apparatus for the first time Second Christopher Tolkien cannot be said to have written any portion of the narrative of this book despite many reviewers intimations to the contrary The bulk of this text appeared in Unfinished Tales with significant gaps Tolkien the son has filled in these gaps using the relevant sections from the much more concise version that was used in assembling The Silmarillion as well as framing material at the beginning and end of the current volume also from The Silmarillion Christopher Tolkien has done little more here than the literary equivalent of very carefully stitching a few patches to mend the gaping holes in an otherwise noble and beautiful garmentOn to the story itself then This is as so many others have already noted with varying degrees of enthusiasm a very dark tale If you dont like very dark tales well then you will quite likely not like this It is also in a prose style as is the vast bulk of Tolkiens work that is very susceptible to being called stilted because compared to contemporary prose it is But as at least one reviewer here has wisely noted the tone is in keeping with the tone of the Nordic sagas of which Tolkien was so fond of and inspired by And like so many ancient sagas and myths this tale is about an entire family haunted by a doom they cannot escapeOr is it I think that Tolkien has done a wonderful job here of subverting the curse of Morgoth and the doom of Hrin and his kin with another motif free will Tolkien who strenuously avoids almost any hint of allegory throughout his vast imaginative work nevertheless imbued almost every corner of that world with reflections of his own deeplyheld Catholic convictions and sensibilities The core of the story is the tension between doomfate on the one hand and free will on the other Trin makes decision after decision that invariably lead to tragic consequences But does he do so because he is doomed to do so Or because he is a man of haughty pride who stubbornly refuses to consider any viewpoint but his own using his considerable gifts natural charisma and rightfullylegendary physicalmartial prowess to charge willfully forward regardless of even foreseeable consequences to anyone and everyone around him I believe that it is very much the latter but without necessarily completely repudiating the former The malice of such a being as Morgoth is a very real force in the tale of the Silmarils and such malevolence bent upon a single family and largely upon a single individual as Trin rises to prominence can be understood to have tangible effect on individuals and events And even on a more mundane level the incursions and aggressive actions of Morgoths forces both the marauding armies of Orcs and the Easterlings who occupy Trins childhood homeland can be understood to push Trin in a particular direction in his life that he might not have gone had circumstances in his life and in his world been otherwise So there is some range to the senses in which Morgoth can be said to have cursed the children of HrinBut Trin has also grown up the proud child of a proud mother effectively orphaned from the age of nine he receives ostensibly every advantage yet the pride instilled in him from the earliest age tragically unravels every opportunity he is presented with from his youthful fostering in the halls of Thingol onwards It is his human choices not the supernatural force of an evil will that guide him on his tragic path and this complex narrative thread is what makes this to my mind one of the greatest of all of Tolkiens tales    Instead of The Children or Hrin this book should be entitled The story in which view spoilerEverybody Dies  by JRR Tolkien Oh My God And here I thought only Shakespeare wrote good Renaissance tragedies Really This story is so tragically sad I forget it was written by TolkienI wont write a summary for the story but Ill write down some things about it that might persuade you to read this amazing book Elves and more Elves If you like wise brave elves who like to fight a lot and are good with a sword and a bow read this  Dragons Evil firebreathing monsters that destroy everything in their path kill half of the characters and torture the main charactercheck Revenge Always a good reason to ruin your life Stubborn flawed cursed main anti hero Who suffers a lot MiddleEarth A nice little walk across the Middle Earth west of the Blue Mountains Its Tolkien ok Do you need more reasonsOk ok Here maybe these nice pictures convince you to read thissourcesourcebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   The Children of Hurin is not a for people who saw the Lord of the Rings movies and then read the book Its for hardcore fans The people who remember all the names from the The Silmarillion Or for the few people out there who reread Beowulf a lot The Children of Hurin reads like a Nordic SagaAs a self proclaimed Tolkien Fanatic I enjoyed The Children or Hurin The Heroic epic and ultimately tragic life of Turin and his sisters Its not more The Lord of the Rings but it continues to paint a more vivid tapestry for the Fellowships stories to play out againstThere are a number or jarring transitions in the book Evidence of the unfinished state Tolkien left the tale in But this actually gives a more authentic feeling to the story Like a recovered Saga or Epic that is missing a few passages Hurin is high fantasy and if it were not set in the world of Tolkiens other stories it would be as unaccessible as the Kalevala Even with its grounding in the world of hobbits it is a book for the few not the many   The Children of Hurin provides some great historical material to Tolkiens world of MiddleEarth and adds even more richness to the Lord of the Rings This addition to Tolkiens extensive historical background of Middleearth fills in the gaps and fleshes out stories that have been mentioned and hinted at in other works by giving us a detailed and colorful look at the tragic story surrounding Trin and Ninor Hurins children and the ongoing battle against Morgoth the master of the Lord of the Rings evil character SauronThis is a welltold tale with engaging characters and plenty of action that keeps the reader interested throughout While not as enthralling as the Lord of the RIngs Trilogy or as entertaining and wonderful as The Hobbit The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to the MiddleEarth cannon and is a more complete novel than most other source material that is out there It stands on its own well and one does not need to have read any of the other histories to follow along with what is going on hereOverall a solid work that Id recommend to fans of Tolkiens works or epic fantasy in general   "},

maneira que melhor sabia Alguns rezaram outros beberam alm da conta outros inebriaramse numa nefasta e ltima paixo Mas as mes mantiveramse acordadas e prepararam com cuidado amoroso o alimento para a viagem lavaram os seus meninos e prepararam as bagagens ao raiar do dia o arame farpado estava cheio de roupas de criana estendidas ao vento a secar e no esqueceram as fraldas e os brinquedos e os travesseiros e centenas de outras pequenas coisas das quais as crianas sempre necessitam No fariam tambm vocs a mesma coisa Se fossem morrer amanh com os vossos filhos no lhes dariam hoje de comer    This book is said to be one of the most important books ever written about Holocaust What I am referring here are not the history books but the firsthand experiences written and narrated by the people who were there when the Holocaust happened Since I read a handful of these I cant disagree I even think that in some aspects this could be the MOST important of them allYou see Anne Frank wrote her diary    at  while hiding in her house with her family so she was not able to include her harrowing experience in the concentration camp where she died The writing was innocent poignant and endearing but did not contain much Victor Klemperer wrote his volume diary    but a good bulk of it was his experience trying to elude the authorities as he had an Aryan wife so although he was asked to live in a ghetto he did not experience being in a concentration camp Imre Kertesz wrote his quasiautobiographical novel    telling the concentration camp experience of a yo boy Gyorgy George in Auschwitz but he disavowed the strong biographical connection of the book to his life even if he was  when he was sent with his family to the camp Last year I was tearyeyed when I finished reading Elie Wiesels    since it was too emotional and the writing was haunting However Elie Wiesel was  during the Holocaust so he wrote from the perspective of a teenager What I mean is that given that the tragedy was all sad and harrowing we already knew the perspective of a child or a teenager from Anne Frank Kertesz and Wiesel so I thought I also would like to have the perspective of a grownup survivor This now is what Victor Frankl in his clinical book    and Primo Levi in this book    provideIn their books Victor Frankl and Primo Levi recounted WHAT THEY DID TO SURVIVE I thought that this could have only been possible to come from thinking adults who are expected to be less emotional and more rational than most teenagersVictor Frankl says that to survive one has to hold on to the image of yourself stepping out of the camp and going back to your life prior to the concentration camp Everyday you think of yourself going back to your home job loved ones hobby etc These happy images are so powerful they will give you reason to hope and livePrimo Levi is more comprehensive and tothepoint He says three  organization  pity and  theft Levi survived using  as he was a summa cum laude chemistry graduate from Turin so he got lucky to be asked to work in the laboratory making synthetic rubber inside Auschwitz But in this book he gave examples of the prisoners who thrived using the other two or combinations or all the threeThats the reason why I said that this could indeed be the MOST important book written about the Holocaust If it happens again God forbid you have the tips on how to survive Those tips come from first hand experiences of people who experienced them I mean well it is nice to cry and be sad after reading a book but it better to have something like a survival handbook too   Its hard to say anything about this magnificent book that hasnt been said many times before so I wont even try but just write a note on why I have an abiding sadness when I think of the authorPrimo Levi lived all his life in the house of his birth in Turin Italy apart from when he was in the concentration camp Luckily he lived just through that awful murderous year and to all intents and purposes resumed the life of a chemist and author that the Nazis interrupted He wrote The Periodic Table  lauded as the best science book ever written Later he died from a fall down a narrow stairwell It has been argued this wasnt suicide but who climbs over banisters and falls down narrow stairwells except on purpose As Elie Wiesel said Primo Levi died at Auschwitz forty years earlier Alav HaShalom Rest in Peace dear soulFinished July      I will try not to overstate my feelings on this book I believe this is one of if not THE most important book ever written Everyone should read this book It details Levis journey from his home in Turin to Buchenwald It is absolutely beautifully written Levis style of writing is unlike any other Ive read It is detailed incredibly intelligent moving poignant and in some way almost detached from his experience which makes reading about it all the more moving and painful To hear him describe the horrors he saw and went through in such a thirdperson sort of way is truly heartbreaking All of his works are amazing but this is the one that I recommend to all of my friends Ive bought several people copies of this book because I feel it is that important We must never forget what happened And we must never allow it to happen again     Primo Levi was an Italian Jew who came to live in very troubled times Born and raised in Turin he was subjected to the fascist racial laws which discriminated against Jews and made finding employment very difficult after the German occupation of Italy began he joined the resistance movement but was quickly caught and transferred to an internment camp When the camp itself came under German control the authorities started arranging mass deportations of captured Jews to labor and death camps in the occupied east Travelling in a cattle truck through cold and misery Levi arrived at Auschwitz in February  He was  years old and would be one of the twenty Jews who remained alive from his transport of  people when the Red Army liberates the camp in January Survival in Auschwitz is the record of Levis time at the camp in his own words Its worth noting that this is the title specifically picked for the American release I much prefer the original Italian and English translation    which conveys the tone and theme of the book much much better Survival in Auschwitz sounds almost like asurvival manual a set of precepts that one should follow if one finds him or herself at such a place If This Is a Man is taken from a poem by Levi which opens the book and in which he asks his readers  sitting contendly in their warm safe heated houses to remember and think about what happened never forget about it and pass this knowledge on to future generationsConsider if this is a manLevis memoir is a chronicle of life inside a concentration camp a world within a world news from the outside world perpetrate the barbed wire very rarely and only at the end of the book in the form of sound of distant artillery which signify the slowly advancing Russians and the growing panic among camp officials Despite growing increasingly more deformed squalid and haggard and their numbers thinning with every day the camp had a cleaer hierarchical structure which had to be followed and where there was no official hierarchy a nonofficial one was quickly invented When we think about concentration camps we mostly remember their last and most gruesome part the gas chambers and the crematorium As important as they are they are just a part of a larger whole  we often forget that people not only died in these camps but also lived Levis memoir is a chronicle of life inside a concentration camp which in his own word is equal to reaching the bottom with no other condition possibly being more miserable a total demolition of what makes a man the removal of ones personal dignity and reducing people to a sequence of numbers taking away all that they own even their hair being forced to exist in conditions which make existence impossible and reduced to purely biological beings who struggle only to remain alive Despite all this incredibly living is possible even in a place where it couldnt be and because of the smallest things even a nonwindy day can make a world of difference for a prisoner and give him the impression of good fortune because a windy and rainy day is so much worse than ordinary rain Prisoners steal from each other as is the custom but also interact and barter with one another and sometimes even form what in another world would be a friendshipThe experience of reading this book is very intense as Levi does not make excuses for either himself or his fellow prisoners and their behavior he is not sentimental and selfpitying and hides nothing The memoir was first published in  just two years after Auschwitz was liberated his memory is still very fresh and the images and events of Auschwitz are ingrained in his mind like the number on his forearm Because of this If This is a Man Levis testament of the Holocaust is very immediate and reads as if the events described in it happened just yesterday  and with this immediacy is its power resulting in one of the most powerful passages in all of literatureNow everyone is busy scraping the bottom of his bowl with his spoon so as not to waste the last drops of the soup a confused metallic clatter signifying the end of the day Silence slowly prevails and then from my bunk on the top row I see and hear old Kuhn praying aloud with his beret on his head swaying backwards and forwards violently Kuhn is thanking God because he has not been chosen   "},
{"title": "Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman",
"isbn": "0679747044",
"author": "James Gleick",
"text": "Genius is a brilliant interweaving of Richard Feynmans colourful life and a detailed and accessible account of his theories and experiments  nearly half a century of which amount to no less than the story of modern physics itself The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool Richard FeynmanPhysics is like sex sure it may give some practical results but thats not why we do it Richard FeynmanFeynman was lucky in three ways First the guy was born with a brain that somehow gave him access to problems with a speed and a dexterity that seemed magical to his peers and his peers are people that already often stretched the capacity for knowledge and intelligence Second Feynman was lucky to be born at the right time He came into his abilities at the right moment for Physics He was there when physicists post Einsteins relativity seemed to grab a larger piece of global attention Third Feynman was lucky to have participated in WWIIs war of the magicians Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb All of these things combined with Feynmans iconoclastic nature his perseverance and singlemindedness his capacity to get to the root of problems put Feynman second to Einstein in th century mindsThe book itself is a very good example of scientific biography Gleick doesnt stray however too far from the anecdotal autobiography of Feynman in Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character Gleick elaborates provides more detail adds interesting vignettes on other Physicists that fell into Feynmans orbit Wilson Oppenheimer Dyson Dirac Bohr Schwinger GellMann etc Those diversions and Gleicks occasional riffs on the idea of genius keep this from being just an average scientific biography It also was a bit stronger and more robust than Gleicks earlier work Chaos Making a New Science All that said it still wasnt an AMAZING biography I appreciated the time spent on the details The accuracy and notes associated with this book but a lot of the magic of the book existed in Feynman himself and not in the telling of it    I recently finished reading Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick Im a big fan of Gleicks His book on Isaac Newton was brilliant And in this bio of Feynman who was one of the midwives of the atomic bomb Gleick illustrates just how important Feynmans thinking has been to our modern understanding of physics and therefore of energy Feynman grappled with the big questions about matter science and the quest for human knowledge and understanding One of my favorite parts of Gleicks book comes early on when he talks about Feynmans effort to distill human understanding of science into as short a passage as possible Feynman posed himself this question what if all scientific knowledge were lost in a cataclysm What statement would convey the most knowledge in the fewest words to the next generations Feynman proposed this All things are made of atoms  little particles that move around in perpetual motion attracting each other when they are a little distance apart but repelling upon being squeezed into one anotherIn that one little sentence  you will see there is an enormous amount of information about the world if just a little imagination and thinking are appliedGleick is brilliant For me hes a little like Mark Twain in that when I read his stuff it whispers to me that I should perhaps quit what Im doing because Ill just never be that good   Gleick is a thorough intelligent science writer able to give over complex ideas without sacrificing too much depth He still lost me with some of the particle physics stuff Feynman started his academic career as a precocious math undergrad at Princeton and went to the pinnacle of modern science first at the Manhattan Project and later designing a daunting freshman physics curriculum at CalTech later published as Six Easy Pieces His career neatly parallels the modern perception of science theoretical physics was transformed from a discipline akin in practical application to medieval French to a nearreligion captivating the awed respect of the public and leading to enormous increases in governmental research spending and the development of Big Science And later as the pace of new developments dropped and scientists confronted with an everincreasing list of particles gradually gave up on finding a unified theory of the atom more mystical and antiscientific thinking gradually reemerged Notable personal aspects of Feynman were his prefeminist attitudes toward women culminating in protests at some of his public talks and related his nearconstant womanising He never recovered emotionally from the death of his beloved first wife Also worth noting is that his quips and stories seemingly offthecuff were carefully rehearsed in his notebooksAll of which shouldnt take away from the scope of his genius Gleick sees his subject as the genius par excellence akin to Einstein and Newton the latter a previous biographical subject He devotes a chapter in the final section to a fascinating discussion of the nature and history of genius Feynmans thinking was in speed and clarity unlike that of normal peopleOne final point in an interview with the BBC retold by Gleick Feynman becomes quite agitated when asked to explain in laymans terms how magnets work He insists that they just work This is quite out of the ordinary as in every other regard Feynman seemed to consider the ability to explain something in simple terms as the hallmark of a clear understanding This just adds to my conviction that the Insane Clown Posse was really onto something    This biography puts Feynman in a more balanced neutral light for me When reading his memoirs you only get a glimpse and rather slanted presentation if you are really wanting to learn about Richard FeynmanThis book is really heavy on his scientific endeavors which shouldnt be surprising Despite this the text is very readable and engaging even for those less scientifically inclinedIn my review of Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman I mentioned how much I thought I related to him Well if you met me you probably wouldnt see any resemblance whatsoever most likely Its simply the way he thought about things and his adherence to truth in social encounters and how he was always figuring things out I certainly do not relate to the magician showman or physicist he also was or claim to be anything close to what he is But his stories are very refreshing for me to readThe biography goes into more of his personal life mostly in regards to relationships Reading about him and his wife is touching but I still do not think I fully understand the man in his dealings with womenTalking merely about Feynman is an injustice to this particular book because his colleagues and the science of the time are heavily delved into even more sometimes than about Feynman himself In fact maybe the book is just that a history of the physics at that time and Feynman is the star of the show   I learned about Feynman as a teen when I happened across an interview with him on tv His character and intellect fascinated me and years later I decided to learn more about himGleick covers Feynmans entire life in this biography His prose is good and he maintains a pleasing balance of anecdote and historical fact Feynman had a large vital personality and Gleick is able to convey this without parroting the tone and content that Feynman uses in his autobiographical work Ive always been able to appreciate Feynman based on his own words thanks to Gleick I had the chance to see him from another perspective and appreciate him all the more   "},

"text": "An unknown doomsday virus quickly claims the lives of four people across the country  including Dr Sophia Russell a researcher leading the team trying to crack the disease Devastated and enraged her fiance Lt Colonel Jonathan Smith uncovers evidence that his lovers death was no accident  that someone out there has the virus and the pandemic that threatens countless millions of lives was plannedNot knowing where to turn or whom to trust Smith assembles a private team to aid his fight against the deadly virus While the death toll mounts rapidly their quest leads them to the highest levels of power and the darkest corners of the earth as Smith and his team match wits with a determined genius out to destroy them with the fate of the world in the balance  I have to admit now Robert Ludlum is my guilty pleasureHis books are addictive I dont mind having him as my mostread author His stories give me cheap thrills Cheap in both literal and figurative senses Literal because his books are being sold for about  or  and they flood the secondhand bookshops Figurative because whenever I mention to my literary friends that I love Robert Ludlum I do not get thumbs up unlike when I say that my favorite author is Leo Tolstoy or Alan HollinghurstRobert Ludlum is so commercial that it is almost expected that any thirtyish or fortyish man like me would at some point in his life read all the Ludlum books available in the marketplace Nobody pays attention if a man or even a woman reads or even professes his admiration to his works It is like John Grisham or Dan Brown for the current generation Or maybe my nonliterary readerfriends would still be in awe if they hear somebody reading Dan Brown since its been only a decade ago when the duo bestsellers The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons hit the marketThe Hades Factor started the Covert One series so it was here where Sgt Jon Smith was introduced It was in this book where his girlfriend and fellow scientist Sarah Russell died because of viral epidemic I thought I felt that the event in the book was similar to the SARS that started in Hong Kong in  I thought that maybe Ludlum was inspired by that event Then I noticed that this book was first published in  a year before Ludlum died So Ludlum actually sort of predicted that some kind of disease from monkey would spread throughout the world  years before it actually happenedSo if Aldous Huxley predicted the use of hallucinatory drugs for brainwashing or cloning of babies Robert Ludlum predicted the spread of monkey or fowl virus worldwide Its quite creepy thinking about all these good novelists being able to predict some catastrophic events in the near futureA film shooting of another movie of the Bourne series is being shot here in Manila Thats one reason why I also picked this book I wanted to go to the shooting to watch until I realized that it is Robert Ludlum who I admire and not some kind of crappy secondrate actor Sorry I just miss Matt Damon Why the hell they decided to let go of himI have to complete this series One of the best book series that Ive read   I love Robert Ludlum This book has the oddest set of characters ever in a Robert Ludlum book of international intrigue This is a better spy novel than most spy novels Dr Smith morning the loss of his fiance joins the hunt for her killer and finds out it was no lab accident He has to call in every marker and favor from his past in counter espionage a world he had thought he had left behind to keep himself out of jail and alive long enough to savethe planet From a deadly viral killer Some of the characters were Clive Cusslerishly larger than life but generally Gauyle Lynds and Ludlum manage to keep them under control The story is generally tight and the pace moves from fast to feverishly fast I enjoyed this book and the sequel very much This isnt quite as cerebral as James Rollins if one can call action adventure Cerebral but it is very complex Its a little weak on character development past the main three all men but there is potential to flesh out a couple more in future stories More to it than your average germophobia case   First I should explain that I have read the book twice and seen the movie twice Second I am a big fan of Robert Ludlums work This is one of Ludlums best efforts and I highly recommend eitherboth the book and the movieThe story opens with the start of a plague First a couple of soldiers die then other people Clearly easy to spread this disease and clearly it is deadly No cure Early the story takes on a mideast terrorist theme and we begin to learn the disease is being spread by the terrorists As the team at Covert One a secret US government intelligence agency rampsup we learn that the terrorists have a method of deployment of this airborne virus that will be very effective The story mostly focuses on where did the original virus come from and who is causing it to be spread There are some plot twists slowing down the investigation like murder of some key people While the story seems to be exclusively a bioterrorist plot there is a big plot twist where the terrorists are simply the agent of the people who are really behind the plotA well told story with building suspense Alot of reality in the story which is chilling to imagine this could really happen ie it aint scifi it could happen In the real world we have seen SARS Bird Flu and recently HN Flu effecting the population what if the disease is more deadly than these What if it spread widely Yes this is an exciting suspenseful story This is an exciting race against time to save the world I highly recommend it   Basically a quick read just grabbed it on the way out the door leaving for a trip typical Ludlum but not as good as earlier ones Spoiler Alert where the beautiful lover of protagonist is killed which sets him off on a quest to find those responsible Farfetched plot of virulent virus that is purposely manufactured and spread by evil leader of pharmaceutical company so that he can become even more wealthy by miraculously and very conveniently having millions of doses of the cure available for a previously unknown virusjust a tad suspicious There were some interesting characters like Marty the eccentric computer wizard Peter the Brit and Samson the Doberman guard dog but then I am biased toward Dobermans  A long long time ago I had really enjoyed a few Ludlum novels so I thought it might be time to read another of his books after originally thinking the plots and characters were getting too repetitive so I had to quit reading them Apparently twenty years was not long enough time in between reading his stuff again Maybe Ill try again in another twenty years    Standard covertone novel As usual the plot is good like other novels of the series A deliberately engineered lethal virus is spread to cause a pandemic for financial profits and it kills the fiancee of Smith the protagonist He starts an investigation which leads to capture of the powerful nexus The story is decently paced but at times paused by emotional ramblings My favorite character is Marty the computer geek I could spot some minor flaws in the story line If I got the chronology correct Smith was attacked before Sophia got involved in the case which has not reason Attack on Smith should have been preceded by Sophias involvement Next the murder of Director of NHI who deleted phonelab records and was subsequently run over was never investigated while it should have given important clues Even if the author wanted to highlight it as a humanly mistake of the protagonist it should have mentioned in third person Overall a good book    "},

Captain Vimes Constable Carrot and the rest of the Night Watch who along with other brave citizens risk everything including a good roasting to dethrone the flying monarch and restore order to AnkhMorpork before its burned to a crisp A rare tale well done as only Terry Pratchett can Ive been rereading some of the older Pratchett novels Partly because I simply enjoy them Partly because they help keep me sane in an increasingly infuriating world And partly because they are comfortable to me The literary equivalent of a security blanket But Ill be honest Im also reading them so I can postpone reading the final Pratchett novel that came out a little while ago It will be hard for me to read that knowing that afterwards there will be no more new Pratchett to read Ever This is the book that introduces Vimes perhaps my favorite Discworld character And thats saying something given the number of books in the series and the number of truly delightful characters That said on rereading this I was surprised to see where Vimes got his start The Vimes in this first book is a good character but its not the character I grew to love Its pretty obvious that Pratchett was planning on him being a Discworld version of the downonhisluck gumshoe detective Harddrinking and bitter More stubborn than cleverDont get me wrong Vimes is a good character in this book but hes not particularly noteworthy Carrot and the Patrician shine moreAs a writer its interesting for me to see how Pratchett started here with a functional but not stellar character who he then changed rather abruptly into one of my favorites in the whole series Its nice for me to see that Pratchett didnt have it all planned out ahead of time and that he was in fact just making it all up as he went along    How To Read Terry Pratchetts Discworld Novels Skip the first two books in the series This is crucial If you read these first you will be rightly annoyed by their justbarelyokayness and spend the rest of your life muttering about how overrated he is Terry Pratchett wrote these two books Then all of a sudden he started writing really really well I dont know what happened Maybe he sold his soul My own theory is that his longsuffering wife waited as patiently as she could for him to pull himself together as a writer and then after she proofread his second novel something in her snapped and she thwapped him in the head with the book in question Youre better than this damn it she shouted Now get in there and write something good And he did Start with the first book in one of the subseries The Discworld books all take place on the same planet but they involve different groups of peopleThe witches my favoritesThe Night Watch my alsofavoritesDeath granted hes not a group but he does have a familyThe wizardsOkay there are standalones like Small Gods And in a way all the Discworld books are standalones Except for the first two because the first one ends on a cliffhanger Like I said skip them until youve read some of the really good ones and then brace yourself and read them purely for continuity purposes I started with the rd book in the series Carpe Jugulum and was perfectly fine other than a tendency to preach the gospel of Discworld Is Flippin Amazing And You Have To Read These Books which Im trying to get under controlBut its a lot of fun to follow the threads To start for instance with Equal Rites which introduces you to both the witches and the wizards This isnt Hogwarts and those most definitely are not the same thing in Discworld Then you can go on to Wyrd Sisters and Witches Abroad and fall absolutely in love with Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg I fully intend to be Granny Weatherwax when I grow up right down to the goat farm and the ability to terrify people just by saying Good morning Watch this spaceOr you can start with Guards Guards and be introduced to the men of the Night Watch Just bear in mind that Im first in line if Captain Vimes becomes available so keep your inevitable crush on him to yourselfI posted approximately  updates while I reread this book all quotable quotes Thats not even all the bits I wanted to post but Goodreads has a strict wordcount limit on updates because Goodreads hates me knows how I getYou can get a perfectly good sense of whether or not youll enjoy Guards Guards by perusing said updates You will enjoy it if you already enjoy fantasy you will very likely enjoy it even if you dont generally enjoy fantasy because the humor characterization and dialogue are ridiculously goodHave a good time And remember  hands off Vimes Hes mine   What I love most about Pratchetts books is that under a thin layer of funny footnotespeppered punheavy parody lies the core of deep seriousness rooted in the quite sobering understanding of the shallow pettiness of human mundanity fueled by jealousy bile spite and closemindedness  In the end the only thing that makes it possible to wake up in the morning is just a slight deviation from this depressing state of affairs that leads to the understanding and a bit of dignity and doing whats right  even when thats not quite expected Because someone has to uphold whats right Because someone needs to swim against the current   This is one of my favorite Discworld books and one of the best starting points for the Discworld newbies It is the first book in the subcycle focusing on the City Watch of Ankh Morpork the Pearl of Cities on the Disc the book that really takes a look into the inner workings of this crowded dirty and despicable and yet lovably tenacious urban metropolis In Pratchetts tradition of deconstructing the tropes this one has its kings and tyrants and secret societies and dragons and maidens and heroes and heirs with birthmarks and magical swords as well as milliontoone chances  except that things tend to not work out as planned And all of it is woven into a neat tight plot that carries us through the dry humor and slapstick and sad seriousness to the unexpected depth as you allow the cogs and wheels of your brain turn contemplating Pratchetts intentions  I am a Sam Vimes girl through and through And this book is our introduction to our cynical antihero uncompromising grumpy and terrifyingly soberknurd knurd as in complete and utter opposite to drunk beyond simple sobriety AnkhMorpork copper with the unsettling tendency to ask uncomfortable questions when others would much rather he didnt This is the beginning of the Vimes we all know and love the evolution from the downinthegutter pessimistic drunk brung low by a woman the city itself that is to the equally pessimistic servant not of the King or the Patrician but the law a thorn in the side of so many notsouncorrupt but quite respectably upstanding Ankh citizens Reduced to almostnothingness by the corruption in the city spending his time in the gutter literally laughed at by everyone except his two colleagues  the thick but amiable Fred Colon and a disgrace to human race aka Nobby Nobbs  Vimes gets a bit of a wakeup call when the Watch gets its newest recruit Lance Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson a nottoobright but earnest  foot  inches dwarf hes adopted okay armed with a Book of Laws and Ordinances of AnkhMorpork and a decidedly nonmagical swordAnd when the city is facing danger Vimes bit by bit begins to think about it as HIS city After all    And once Vimes sets his singleminded nature to accomplish something occasionally aided by the Librarian who is a peanutloving orangutan and the imposing figure of Lady Sybil Ramkin who breeds swamp dragons in her spare time there is little that can stop him The threat to AnkhMorpork is real and quite substantial view spoiler but ultimately its brought along and fueled by the simple human greed shallowmindedness and jealousy little pathetic mundanity of human existence that Pratchett so nonchalantly and nonpreachily lets showcase itself He it seems has an excellent ability of seeing the lessthanpleasant things that make people tick  and still manages to make these sad realizations both sidesplittingly and laughthroughtears funny And I adore that  Another prominent figure in this book in addition to Vimes and Carrot is of course Lord Havelock Vetinari the enigmatic Patrician the tyrant who is not quite well tyrannical the man with his finger on the pulse of the city the man who would not build a dungeon out of which he could not escape the man resembling a predatory flamingo who makes Ankh Morpork work and in cynicism can greatly rival Vimes himself This is the beginning of the fascinating and not always so voluntary cooperation between Vimes and the one in power and its lovely to read about  And of course some place of prominence is given to the Librarian the aforementioned orangutan who no pun intended will go bananas if you dare to call him the mword view spoilerMonkey  The Librarian who knows how to navigate the Lspace that parallel dimension that exists between every library in the world created because of terrifying power of books  I highly recommend this book to anyone as a perfect starting point on their Discworld journey It is a perfect introduction to the world of intelligent humor peppered with allusions to almost everything you can think of and smart conclusions that make you think and even ask the uncomfortable questions of yourself and the society It is a lovely way to spend several hours curled up in a chair on a rainy day mesmerized by Pratchetts wit and wisdom The audiobook version of it is wonderful immersing you in the atmosphere of the story incredibly well For all of it I give it  stars  and without much further ado embark on the rest on my Ankh Morpork City Watch reread  brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   At the time of writing Terry Pratchett passed away about a week ago Beside making me sad the news also triggered a sudden urge to read a Discworld book which needed to be satisfied immediately I havent read any Terry Pratchett books for years I have always liked them but there are just so many books in the world and you know how it is one thing led to another and somehow they didnt lead back to Sir Terry In the meantime I have been reading many inferior flavor of the month books like The Martian I have been doing myself a disservice reallyGuards Guards is one of the most popular Discworld books and I have not read it this makes it the ideal candidate for a reentry into this unique and wonderful series Anyway it is nice to be back in AnkhMorpork the most chaotic city in fantasy fiction At the most basic level Guards Guards is Pratchetts take on the police procedural but his imagination is too immense to constrain the book to just a single genre parody so there is much more to this book than just the City Watch AnkhMorporks feeble excuse for a police force The Watch mean are happily doing a crappy job which basically involve ringing bells at certain times of the night to announce that all is well in the city It takes the arrival of an extremely honest and straightlaced human orphan raised by dwarves to remind the Watchmen what they are supposed to be and a huge dragon summoned from another dimension burning up the citizens and half the city to spur them into actionOne reason I only read Terry Pratchett occasionally is that I personally prefer books where humour is a minor element of the story rather than placed at the front and centre After reading Guards Guards I have to admit this is my misconception of what Pratchett was doing with the Discworld series after the first few straightforward fantasy parody books The humour takes centre stage but underneath  not even far underneath  Pratchett was using Discworld as a mirror to explore lampoon and critique our world with its many ills and injustice Certainly Guards Guards explores the theme of the policemens duty and honor against personal safety and interest what makes a good cop and a bad cop so to speak He also skewers the masses tendency to blindly accept whoever has the biggest gun or fire breathing talent These and other serious issues are explored without ever missing a humorous beat The book is a laugh fest from beginning to end I dont think there is a single page that did not make me at least chuckleI actually laughed out loud several times my favorite joke involves the phrase Bjorn Stronginthearm is my uncle which highlights the bizarreness of the British phrase Bobs your uncle Also the patricians questioning of dragons penchant for sleeping on a huge pile of gold instead of a comfy mattress is brilliant Dont worry I have not spoiled the book for you I am barely scratching the surface of the many ingenious satires jokes and witticisms to be found in this bookThe characterization of the protagonists and antagonists is also very strong Captain Vimes is silly and funny yet flawed sympathetic honorable and extremely likable I am not surprised he one of Pratchetts most beloved characters The formidable Patrician Vetinari is another extremely vivid and lively creation in a TV adaptation of another Discworld book he is perfectly portrayed by Charles Dance so you can imagine the dry wit and suavity of the man His method of escaping from captivity in a dungeon is pure evil geniusGuards Guards is effortlessly a fivestar book and if I may leave you with a quote from this book that works perfectly even out of contextThe reason that clichs become clichs is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communicationThe irony is that there is not one clich in this book unless you count the ones that Pratchett turned on their headsRIP Sir Terry you were the bestCredit celticwren   First of all my site has the videos that go with this httpsclsiewertwordpresscomBut heres the lite versionMy Terry Pratchett Experience  is remarkably similar to my Month Python Experience Fun and funny but really best done in small doses Say  minute doses if Im watching longer if Im reading It turns out I havent read GuardsGuards before although I thought I had Quite possibly it is because I had not Quite possibly its because I had and forgot but youd think Id remember the dragons For future reference its the one where the adopted dwarf Carrot goes to the big city of AnkhMorpork and joins the Night Watch in hopes of Becoming a Man Night Watch captain Sam Vines spends most of his days and nights in an alcoholic stupor but the antics of Carrot in Enforcing Law and Order soon force Vines into involvement Meanwhile a secret society the Elucidated Bethren of the Ebon Night has decided to summon a dragon intending on overthrowing the Patrician Lord Vetinari and replacing him with an oldfashioned monarchy Some of the Brothers are quite sure they are being held down and need a monarchy to make things rightLike Monty Python Pratchett specializes in absurdity in mocking our perceptions definitions and expectation Clever and funny a little bit of social commentary with an edge both are particularly skilled in word gamesWhich puts me in mind of another famous sketch based on you know meaning and suchI wish to complain about this parrot I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutiqueWhats wrong with itIts deadNo no its restingIt is funny but when its all clever wordplaymocking villains in their thick dark cowls and the general populace for being sheep and Carrot for being So Earnest and Lady Sybil for being such a hearty large Englishwoman and the only one who is really clever is the Patricianwell its a bit hard to empathize And honestly rather tiringThen theres the Librarian an orangutan who runs the greatest library in the world Hes trying to make Constable Carrot understand a serious crime has been committedWhich pretty much reminds me of the Albatross sketch Both use the device of the straight man for maximum sillinessThe Albatross at IntermissionAt the end of the day certainly fun Theres certainly messages and social commentary that elevate it above simple romps but it tends to be applied with heavy emphasis Like Python best enjoyed in short sketches Dont worry Ill show myself outOn the way to the Ministry of Silly Walks   "},
{"title": "Smith of Wootton Major",
"isbn": "004440722X",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "This collection includes two of Tolkiens best fairy stories The world of Faery is the setting for Smith of Wootton Major The preparation of Great Cake to mark the Feast of Good Children was a human cheerful occasion but other less material powers were at work and the world of man and of Faery met and blended in a strange haunting unionLeaf by Niggle is an apt and beautiful illustration of Tolkiens theory that fairy stories about the Faery have either own literary value and should not be seen either as academic exercises or as stories written specifically for children A visit to Faery Beware It may touch your soulUnlike Lord of the Rings which Tolkien labored over for decades Smith came to him in a flash and he dashed it off whole It has a rough quality which betrays both that inspiration and that lack of refining Nonetheless it should entertain and enrich any reader who appreciate Farmer Giles of Ham or Leaf by Niggle An excellent companion for On Fairy Stories from The Tolkien Reader since Smith of Wootton Major is just such a fairy storyBTW it is only on the second or third reading that the wonder grew upon me The first time through I read it like any storyand of that it was quick and crude Subsequent readings the Faery grows upon youAfter fifth reading it still grabs me as usually only real fairy tales do Most modern fantasy seems so contrived Tolkien had a grasp for what really works   Smith of Wootton Major is a fairytale by Tolkiens own definition The fairies are not small and precious but real and potentially dangerous and so is their land Its a rather quiet story I think  there are no great dangers no dragons to be fought or Dark Lords to be overthrown though you might see echoes of that story here The precious star was in earlier drafts a ring after allIn any case its a thoughtful little story I almost said sweet but I think that would be reducing it to something like the decoration on the cake which insults the fairy queenThis extended edition casts light on Tolkiens thought process during all stages of his creative process with it It includes much of the backstory and explanations which support the story which he had to know whether the readers did or not It also contains some early drafts both reproduced and transcribed Its interesting particularly if youre interested in Tolkiens creative process   Il fabbro di Wootton Major  un racconto di JRR Tolkien pubblicato nel  lultima opera mentre lautore era ancora in vita Romanticamente potremmo considerarla una sorta di commiato dellautore al mondo di Faerie una fiaba per bambini ben ponderata come dimostrano le diverse stesure e gli appunti dellautore a riguardo ed equilibrata piuttosto che uno spontaneo volo dimmaginazione La novella avrebbe dovuto essere parte della prefazione di Tolkien a The Golden Key storia di fate di George MacDonald ma si svilupp come racconto a sLa trama  semplice e pur non essendo collegata in nessun modo alla Terra di Mezzo riecheggia il leif motiv di molte opere dellautore soprattutto lattacco dei Racconti ritrovati nel paese di Wootton Major immaginario ma indubbiamente anglosassone ogni ventiquattro anni si tiene una festa a cui partecipano ventiquattro bravi bambini Per loccasione il Maestro Cuoco serve una torta ma in quella preparata da Nokes e dal suo apprendista Alf c una sorpresa una pietra scintillante nascosta nella torta insieme ad altri ninnoli che viene inconsapevolmente ingoiata dal figlio del Fabbro La pietra si incastona nella fronte del bambino e si rivela un vero e proprio lasciapassare nonch protezione per i reami di Faerie che Fabbro esplora in lungo e in largoIl tema principale della fiaba forse pi alla portata degli adulti che dei bambini  quello della rinuncia ampio spazio viene dato oltre naturalmente alle peregrinazioni di Fabbro nelle terre fatate alle modalit di cessione della pietra a un successore perch come raccomanda Alf che forse  molto pi di chi dice di essere al protagonista ci sono cose che non possono appartenere a un uomo per sempre n si possono conservare come cimeli di famiglia Sono solo prestate laccesso a Faerie concesso a Fabbro finch  giovane e pieno di immaginazione diventa impossibile nel momento in cui allimmaginazione subentra la saggezza della maturit Impossibile non lasciarsi tentare da un paragone con lUnico Anello oggetto colmo di potere maligno la cui cessione  quasi sempre accompagnata dal sangueFabbro come dicevamo rappresenta forse lo stesso Tolkien nellatto di ritirarsi da Faerie cio dai reami della sua immaginazione e di lasciare la sua pietra scintillante perch qualcun altro possa riceverlaUn commento alledizione Il fabbro di Wootton Major  inserito anche nella raccolta Albero e foglia ed  di quella che consiglio lacquisto Le pagine di questedizione in particolare  dal costo spropositato giustificato solo in parte dalla bellezza delle edizioni deluxe Bompiani  sono quasi interamente dedicate ad appunti di Tolkien correzioni apparati critici tanto che la fiaba in s occupa solo quaranta delle sue centoquaranta pagine illustrazioni di Pauline Baynes le stesse delledizione originale compreseRecensione pubblicata anche suhttpwwwlastambergadeilettoricom    um livro muito legal para quem  f de Tolkien A histria  bem pequena menos da metade de livro O restante do livro  um pouco de contexto sobre a histria e porque ela foi escrita juntamente com algumas ligaes sobre a vida do Tolkien na pocaEsse foi o ltimo livro escrito pelo Tolkien antes de sua morte e diz muito sobre o seus pensamentos sobre escrita sobre o mundo das fadas que no tem nada a ver com o que pensamos dele atualmente e sobre a vida no geralA histria em si lembra um pouco do Mestre Gil de Ham no estilo de escrita   While most of his genius went into the world of MiddleEarth and its fantastical history JRR Tolkien produced a number of smaller stories during his lifeAnd though he disliked allegory the enchanting Smith of Wootton Major is a bit of an oddity among his writings  a beautifully fantastical little fable that drips over with Tolkiens love of real deep fairy tales And unlike many a story of elves or faeries since Tolkien keeps that sense of mystery and magic in the world of the supernaturalIt takes place in a little town not very long ago for those with long memories not very far away fro those with long legs The Master Cook of that village takes a vacation and returns with an apprentice in tow But something odd happens at the Feast of the Cake  the cook stirs in a faystar with little trinkets in the cake and its accidentally swallowed by a boy thereThe boy later called Smith is changed by the faystar which sparkles on his forehead When he grows up Smith ventures into Faery itself and even meets the Faery Queen herself The message she gives him is for her mysterious missing husband the King  who turns out to be the last person anybody in Wootton Major would have expectedSmith is a fairy tale in the best sense Dont expect cackling witches or convenient loopholes in spells here Tolkien was too skilled for that Instead we have majestic fey and sparkling magic woven with a tidy medieval town consider the custom of naming people after their jobs  Smith a smith capisce Never once does it become precious or cutesy only more enchanted as it goes alongIts also among Tolkiens simpler writings especially since it is effectively a short story In fact its so simple that it barely has a plot  the vanishing King is the closest it has to conflict or a complete plotBut Tolkiens writing sparkles with little details of the fey with only a minimum of description His glimpses of Faerieland are too brief but written with the exquisite haunting quality of his betterknown works Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain And he gives the impression of a world of magic far greater than any human could grasp  bearing the white ships that return from battles on the Dark Marches of which men know nothingAnd Smith is an odd sort of hero infused with a kind of otherworldly light and grace that shines from him in the form of Starbrow Perhaps it was so stand in for the ability to see the magical and fantastical in the mundane world  and if so perhaps Tolkien felt that he himself had been given a faystar that never left himCertainly the beauty and sweetness of Smith of Wootton Major suggest that he had one always  an underrated little tale of magic and faerie which highlights Tolkiens sublime writing   "},
{"title": "The Hobbit",
"isbn": "054792822X",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "Librarian note an alternate cover for this edition can be found Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable unambitious life rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbithole in Bag End But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey there and back again They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent a large and very dangerous dragonThe prelude to The Lord of the Rings The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies since its publication in  establishing itself as one of the most beloved and influential books of the twentieth century Some books are almost impossible to review If a book is bad how easily can we dwell on its flaws But if the book is good how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work The Hobbit is at one level simply a charming adventure story perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told There see how simple that was If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable At some level there is little more to say Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces Thats enoughBut if it was only simple entertainment I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book Instead this simple childrens story resonates and fascinates It teases and hints at something larger and grander and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing lecturing or being condescendingAt its heart the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in The Hobbit when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof How often has that idea fascinated meConsider also how the story opens with Bilbos breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit and Gandalfs continual meditation on the meaning of Good morning How much insight is concealed within Gandalfs gentle humor How often do we find ourselves like Bilbo saying something we dont really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning How often do we find ourselves saying I dont mean to be rude but when in fact we mean I very much mean to be rude and here it comes If we did not mean to be rude surely we wouldnt say what we say Instead we mean Im going to be rude but I dont want you to think Im someone who is normally rude or Im going to put myself forward but I dont want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant or even Im going to be rude but I dont want to think of myself as someone who is rude so Im going to pretend Im not being rudeI think that is what makes this more than just a good book but a great one Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or selfloathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form and we have for as long as weve had recorded literature Our comic books are filled with those neopagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to whatever else may be true of them beats people up good These modern Ajaxs Helens and Achilles dominate the box office and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well Oh sure the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt attract the opposite sex and enforce their will upon others but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility How different is Tolkiens protagonist from Heracles Lancelot Beowulf or Batman  short small mundane and weak Of all the principal characters of the story he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute  martial prowessAnd yet he is not actually merely an average Joe Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles its just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isnt the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves Bilbo is gentle He is simple He is humble Power and wealth have little attraction for him He is kind He takes less than his share and that that he takes he gives away He is a peacemaker Though wrongly imprisoned he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him Rather he apologizes for stealing food and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took Though mistreated he harbors no enmity He never puts himself forward but he never shirks when others do How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero and yet how much better we would be if we did How much better off would we be if we like Thorin could declare in our hearts There is more in you of good than you know child of the kindly West Some courage and some wisdom blended in measure If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to beat people up good What real use could we put it too How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbos virtues rather than Achilles speed strength and skill with arms How much less mature does this mere childrens book of a well litworld cause our darker fantasies to seemNow I admit I am biased in my review I read this book  times before the age of  I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading Yet in my defense I will say that Im considered only a moderate fan of the book by many Ive known several devotees of the book who like the protagonist of Bradburys Fahrenheit  can recite whole chapters from memory  ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the worlds technology if only the worlds story tellers survived If you are inclined to think no book can be that good and that my review overhypes it so much the better Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded Forget all I have said save that If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable   There are some days when I actually think that the humble Hobbit is superior to its bohemoth brother    Its a much tighter story and Bilbo is a much more appeal character than is Frodo I also just love this poem from The HobbitFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo seek the pale enchanted goldThe dwarves of yore made mighty spellsWhile hammers fell like ringing bellsIn places deep where dark things sleepIn hollow halls beneath the fellsFor ancient king and elvish lordThere many a gleaming golden hoardThey shaped and wrought and light they caughtTo hide in gems on hilt of swordOn silver necklaces they strungThe flowering stars on crowns they hungThe dragonfire in twisted wireThey meshed the light of moon and sunFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo claim our longforgotten goldGoblets they carved there for themselvesAnd harps of gold where no man delvesThere lay they long and many a songWas sung unheard by men or elvesThe pines were roaring on the heightThe winds were moaning in the nightThe fire was red it flaming spreadThe trees like torches blazed with lightThe bells were ringing in the daleAnd men looked up with faces paleThe dragons ire more fierce that fireLaid low their towers and houses frailThe mountain smoked beneath the moonThe dwarves they heard the tramp of doomThey fled their hall to dying fallBeaneath his feet beneath the moonFar over the misty mountains grimTo dungeons deep and caverns dimWe must away ere break of dayTo win our harps and gold from him   From a hole in the ground came one of my favorite characters of all time the very reluctant and unassuming hero Bilbo Baggins As a child The Hobbit sparked my young imagination causing wonderful daydreams and horrible nightmares As a teen the book made me want to become a writer of fantastical talesor go shoeless live in a hole and smoke a pipe As an adult Tolkiens novel maintains within me a link to my childhood safekeeping cherished memories and evoking everlasting emotions The troubles with trolls those slinking spiders the finding of treasure cave exploration riddles in the darkit all added up in me a love for adventure I would make many an ornate wooden sword in my fathers basement workshop because of Sting Funny I didnt take to wearing rings thoughBeing pintsized Mr Baggins makes the perfect magnetic character for a young person He is about a childs size yet he is mature Similar yet something to aspire to His diminutive stature made his implausible escapes and victories that much more satisfying Nothing bores me more than musclebound killing machines wielding swords the size of windmill blades I have read this fantastic tale a number of times watched the s cartoon movie version countless times and was counting down the days with unabashed eagerness until Peter Jacksons new live action film came out I will continue to read The Hobbit again and again for the road goes ever ever onAppendixish type reviewsThe Hobbit the  animated film version by Rankin  BassThis may be the movie Ive watched the most in my life This is the one I can quote from start to finish and annoy the fuck out of my friends I try to refrain but when John Huston bellows out I am Gandalf and Gandalf means MEwell I just cant help myself Crazyoffhisrocker Brother Theodore as Gollum still astounds me with the sheer depth of his guttural growl Sorry voicestraining Serkis but this is the real Gollum the creepy muthah that kept me up nights Though Rankin  Basss version skips over the whole Beorn scene entirely coming in at  minutes they actually managed to pack in quite a bit of story Certainly it is truncated to absurdity during The Battle of Five Armies but at least its not overblown as appears to be happening with Peter Jacksons unnecessarily long trilogy of this single book The Hobbit or There And Back Again An illustrated book by Rankin  BassThough its a few pages shorter than the regular paperback version this marvelous parttext partillustrated version seems to be unabridged It includes screenshots taken directly from the s cartoon plus where the movie skipped over parts of the book theyve included extra illustrations admittedly of mixed quality Its a little strange to see the same characters rendered differently sitting side by sidebut nonetheless its always fun to see how artists interpret the work especially when its a work dear to your heartThe Hobbit a film version by Peter JacksonIts never fun to see an artist tear the heart out of a work Peter Jackson was given too long a leash when New Line stretched this one book out to three separate movies Instead of one movie packed with awesome we get three that so far Ive yet to see the third and Im not eager to have been watered down and dragged out Extra scenes are added and add nothing Really a sleigh ride chase scene with an incredibly minor character And honestly can Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield act with any other part of his body besides his eyebrows   EDIT  Ive just about had it with people trying to change my mind on every Tolkien review Ive written Please dont comment if youre going to complain Im glad you enjoy his work but Ive given him more than a fair try and I simply dont like his storytelling I am actually allowed to feel that way no matter how scandalous you find that idea Thank you  To be fair it really is a cool story Mr Tolkiens imagination is endless and I respect him immensely for that To be able to conjure a whole new magical world and all these creatures in it absolutely amazing But it is also a very longwinded story and I found myself struggling to get the job done Reading is not supposed to be a job its supposed to be fun and relaxing For me The Hobbit was not an engaging story  I was distracted constantly and kept missing paragraphs The story in itself is pretty great but the way it is told makes the magic disappear I am not quite sure how to explain Maybe it was the way it was written or the fact that they take a long time before anything happens I should also mention the highly anticlimactic end of Smaug and the fact that I cant tell any of the dwarves apart And the songs Dear Merlin the songs I felt like I was in a ruddy musicalIm sad that I didnt like it as much I wish I did In any case still a cool story bro   Maybe one day soon Ill write a proper review of The HobbitIn the meantime I want to say thisIf you are a child you need to read this for Gollums riddlesIf you are an adult you need to read this book to children if you dont have children rent borrow some for at least one opportunity to roleplay GollumBecuz       Click on the link to see a hilarious videoOf course the most compelling reason to add this to your reading list in haste is that its coming to the MOOVIEZZZ Update commentary on the moviez belowBtw if you like kickass fighting elves not to mention pretty kickass sheelves and some sizzling elfdwarf romancewell then you might like the second Hobbit movie more than the book ahemPart  coming to a cinema house near you soonish My PRECCIOOOUUSSSSSand soon Ill have a copy of the all the moviez and they will be me MINE all mine just like my precciousss illustrated copies of the novelHa you didnt think one copy would be enough did youIf you get around used bookstores a lot do look out for an illustrated version of the bookUpdate About the  films by Peter Jackson I didnt find the first  films very memorable He seemed to draw it out almost unbearably and it also felt to me as if he was embellishing the original story a bit The whole thing seemed like actiony rubbish though I personally actually quite enjoyed the swinging shooting swordfighting ninja elves and the bit of romanceBut the THIRD film The Battle of the Five Armies  now that was a good one I almost missed it on the big screen because of the mediocrity of the first two films But I was glad oh so glad that I actually did go and see it The cinematics acting and editing was all very well done but it was the screenwriting and directing that really shone Here we saw a story of courage and cowardice of generosity of greed and avarice of greatness of soul and of smallness of soul of love of selflessness of brotherhood of hatred of humanity of pain of sacrifice of struggle of moral and spiritual victories of sadness and loss but above all of triumph of the soulYes The Battle of the Five Armies  is certainly something that does Tolkien justice at the very least and what a joy it was to behold on the big screen PS The movies also taught us that dwarves CAN be hot   "},

"text": "Over twenty years ago Bill Bryson went on a trip around Britain to celebrate the green and kindly island that had become his home The hilarious book he wrote about that journey Notes from a Small Island became one of the most loved books of recent decades and was voted in a BBC poll as the book that best represents Britain Now for his first travel book in fifteen years Bryson sets out again on a longawaited brandnew journey around the UK Hello Mr Bryson Its been a while Lovely to hear from you again I must admit I got overly excited last year when I learned that you were writing your first travel memoir in years and it was going to be about your adventures in England I love England I loved your earlier book about England Notes from a Small Island and now that were chatting I can honestly say that Ive enjoyed all of your books Although my favorites are that charming one about Australia and that one on hiking the Appalachian Trail Great stuffAnyhoo I was so excited about The Road to Little Dribbling that I preordered it and I started reading it as soon as it arrived It begins with an amusing story of you being hit on the head by a parking barrier ouch and then meeting with your publisher to discuss ideas for your next book He mentioned it had been  years since the publication of Small Island and what a spanking good idea it would be to travel around Britain again It was a good idea You wrote some amusing anecdotes of your travels around England which made me chuckle And you tried to go to different places than you had been before but you did revisit a few spots I especially enjoyed your stories about the Seven Sisters and Runnymede and you included interesting details about whatever region you were in and even some current events Overall it was a delightful readHowever and I mean this as kindly as possible this book was a bit disappointing Now please dont get upset perhaps my expectations were too high and its good to remember how difficult it is to write a fantastic travel memoir But this book just lacked something I finished this weeks ago and since then I have been struggling to put into words why I found it wanting I wasnt one of those readers who found you too grumpy although you do seem a little less charitable than in your previous books but I understand how difficult it is to get older No I think my quibbling comes from the content itself There just wasnt as much meat in this book the stories werent as rich This book was superficial in a way your previous travel memoirs werentAgain please understand I still enjoy your writing and will likely buy whatever book you write next whether its history or another memoir Happy travels to you and please be careful you dont bonk your head againWarm wishes from a fellow native IowanDianeFavorite QuoteWhat a joy walking is All the cares of life all the hopeless inept fuckwits that God has strewn along the Bill Bryson Highway of Life suddenly seem far away and harmless and the world becomes tranquil and welcoming and good And to walk with old friends multiplies the pleasure a hundredfold    What can I say Bryson fans know exactly what they are getting when they pick up one of his books A bit of history information Brysons thoughts and feelings on said information and history A good bit of humor selfdeprecating ironic and at times laugh out loud funny A good combination and that has worked well for him for many years He shares the arcane the personal and the irreverent My one piece of advice If one is ever fortunate to meet this man in person do not go with him to a McDonalds   Bill Bryson represents himself in this book as a grumpy old man and it is frequently hilarious although occasionally verging on the very edge of political correctness Hes does write incredibly well and I found myself reading passages out loud to anyone who would listen and share it with me He wanders between laugh out loud funny and information packed passages with ease and maintained this readers interest nearly all the way through Just a little loss of concentration towards the very end when the jokes thin out and the information becomes a bit dry and over whelming As someone who grew up in England I love the way he pokes fun at the English and yet admires them at the same time I also very much enjoyed the chapters about places I used to know well Four stars because it is not quite as good as some of his others but it was still a great read   BasicallyBut swap in the UK for cloud Ive read all of Brysons other stuff far as I recall I have greatly enjoyed it I laughed so hard at parts of In a Sunburnt Country that I could scarcely breathe But this This is a rambling crotchety old coot and not in a good way There are love poems to verdant landscapes and welldesigned museum spaces But then there are rants against stuff like stupidity that are pretty much complete non sequiturs There are sections about a single museum longer than whats devoted to the entirety of Scotland And Im no expert on UK geography but pretty sure the coverage is awfully lopsided And really if you went somewhere where everything was closed or inaccessible why not leave it out and go elsewhereBryson basically hates cars and parking lots urban development any town thats not stuck in  being denied a predinner drink ugly architecture the public transit experience There is also a number of uncomfortable and socially unacceptable comments that leave one feeling a lot like the moment after That Uncle just said something appalling at Thanksgiving dinnerI might have missed it but I dont recall any mention of a Little Dribbling But frankly you couldnt pay me to go back and look    Brysons funniest book for many years It meant a lot to me since I am also an American expat in England I kept recognizing places Id been and agreeing with the sentiments Two points of criticism though although he moves roughly from southeast to northwest in the country the stops he makes are pretty arbitrary and his subjects of mockery are often what youd call easy targets Do we really need Brysons lead to scorn litterbugs and reality television celebrities

tyrannyFrom the Hardcover edition Every suicide is like a nail bomb full of vicious questions and the questions dont care where they land Why didnt somebody do something  theres one Surely there must have been signs Right there is a triple blow delivered to the bereaved partner and immediate family Theyre reeling from the event then they have to conclude this depression this malaise was so acute it blotted out even thoughts of themselves in the suicides final minutes And after that comes the unspoken accusations and avoidings by friends and associates Why didnt they see and having seen taken steps Some suicides still hang like paradoxically visible black holes of misery up in our skies Sylvia Plath van Gogh David Foster Wallace Kurt Cobain Ernest Hemingway BS Johnson Mark RothkoPrimo Levi committed suicide at the age of  in  The repercussions were uniquely distressing He had been the embodiment of an idea that is so cherished its nearly unbearable to think it may not be true The idea that a person can go through the worst and most inhuman experiences in his case Auschwitz and survive not only in body but in spirit too and not become corrupted and not destroyed Levis books were and are the clearesteyed most lucid most carefully discerning and most humane books about the Holocaust I have come across The idea that Auschwitz finally got him  years later that Hitler had extracted one more posthumous victory was horrible And this final act now throws a long shadow over all his great writings so that we loop round on ourselves and almost catch us yelling and denouncing Levi for doing such a thing and then feel instant shame at such a thought This suicide involves Levis readers inevitably in these psychological traps Of course you can argue that the depression and anguish which led to the suicide might have a whole other aetiology of which we are completely ignorant Its possible and its a comforting thought were it not for the continuous theme in his various writings being Auschwitz and the Holocaust from If This is a man  to The Drowned and the Saved  Or  you can argue that it wasnt a suicide at all it was an accident  an old man fell over a balcony There was no note The concierge of the block of flats had spoken to him minutes before he died He seemed okay But both his biographers think it was suicide We have to say that it doesnt matter The work is the thing Rothkos canvasses are not affected one way or another by his death just as Wuthering Heights would be just as great a novel if Emily Bronte had celebrated her th birthday on  July  as World War One was coming to an end It doesnt matterThe Periodic Table is a quirky memoir of a JewishItalian chemist There are elements of cool humour throughout and hardly a trace of bitterness    Chemistry as a metaphor for life Blurb writers love phrases like that They are short succinct and intriguing But how hard is it to write something that would deliver on such a promiseI had never read anything quite like The Periodic Table It more than delivered  it exceeded my expectations The book is a beautiful marriage of life and science perfectly accessible to a regular reader The truth is that anything can be fascinating provided its explained by a person truly passionate about the subject and it doesnt hurt if they are also mindblowingly good writers like Primo Levi You might know Primo Levi as an Auschwitz survivor and you might worry that The Periodic Table would be too dark of a read But it is not If This is A Man Holocaust is still lurking around shadowy corners of this book and it is quite obvious that Primo Levi would be a different kind of writer if it werent for that trauma some might even ask if he would be a writer at all but this collection of anecdotes recollections allegory and glimpses is I would venture to say an ultimately almost positive if not downright optimistic work The very first story might be a little odd and discouraging but either soldier on or skip it altogether  its not really representative of the rest of the book I found reading about the intricacies of a Piedmont dialect with its borrowings from Hebrew rather fascinating I am interested in the process in which words change their meaning entirely not unlike they did in cockney rhyming slang but I can appreciate that such linguistic elaborations are not to everyones tasteFurther chapters  each named after a different chemical element document Levis life as a chemist and they are often funny tender and bittersweet They are intersected with fictional short stories which read like fairy tales and where chemical elements take on almost mythical qualities The most striking story is the penultimate one in which Levi comes across a German who oversaw his work in the laboratory in Auschwitz Like a true scientist Levi wants to rationalise and understand his feelings He wants to know what it is he expects from the encounter His struggle to organise the swarm of emotions is probably the most touching part of the book The Periodic Table is not a science book whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about Its a book about the love for science Its about what every scientist wants us to believe  that their subject is not some obscure knowledge of interest to few but its life and reality that makes us breathe move and think The last story in the collection spells it out for you in case you missed the more subtle hints in the previous chapters I liked it a lot because it reminded of the times when as a little girl I fantasised about the history of atoms in my body  where they had been before me I imagined them as a part of dinosaurs king and queens old houses wild horses The story is Levis crown argument for his thesis that it is only through matter not sprit we can know the universe And this is a thesis I can easily believe in  it appeals to me I am not what you call spritualIf you made it this far in my review I will reward you with a link to an excellent interview with Primo Levi in the Paris Review of Books httpwwwtheparisrevieworgintervi                                                                                                                                                                                The Connotations of the ElementsAll elements have been named in a more or less arbitrary manner after people places or mythological characters To those who named them if not necessarily us these names had metaphorical connotations For nonscientists this significance might be lost in the scientific haze that befuddles usOne achievement of Primo Levis novel is to revive the power of the metaphors Each element he has chosen represents a person an experience or a story Each chapter named after an element assumes both an individual and a collective powerThe collective power resides in the periodic table The tabular presentation of elements not only identifies each element but because of the way it has been structured it also defines their relationshipsIn this way Levis periodic table symbolises individuals families societies and nationsA Literate ChemistScience is the foundation of society even if most of us have forgotten It took a literate chemist capable of striding over the two cultures scientific and creative to remind usLevi recognised that elements rarely manifest themselves to us in a pure unadulterated form They appear in combinations either as mixtures such as air or compound moleculesIt was only in the th century that scientists started to devote a lot of effort to distinguishing the elements from each other They had to be separated They had to be purified but only for analytical purposes Then with greater knowledge of their properties they could be artificially joined as new compoundsThere was no particular functional value in the unadulterated purity of a single element in its own right apart from any beauty that precious metals like silver and gold might be perceived to haveEnchantment and AdulterationLevi reached this conclusion from a scientific point of view The nature of matter is what is of concern to a scientist or chemist Still he managed to find enchantment in matter and its adulteration It is the stuff of life Without adulteration there would be no life and no diversityBit by bit over the course of the book he communicates his enthusiasm happiness and satisfaction to us It is the wonder of someone who is truly aliveRacial PurityEqually importantly Levi extended the metaphor of adulteration to the type of social and political discourse that emerged in the time of FascismThe German and Italian Fascists were trying to achieve purity of their respective races Professor Googlewiki informs me that in  Mussolini referred to the Italians as the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race He later denounced Nordicism although the issue continued to simmer They regarded other races in particular Jews as threats to racial purity Jews supposedly adulterated Aryan perfection They had to be eliminatedWhat was missing was a perception of different races as different elements in the periodic table The universe does not consist solely of one element There are numerous elements and all of them have a role large or small in making the particular universe that we inhabit No one element can be said to adulterate the universeMatter and SpiritRace is a product of matter The Fascists tried to add weight ironically a rhetorical mass or gravitas to their arguments by resorting to the language of spirituality They believed that a race the matter behind the physical manifestation of the race has a spirit However the spirit according to Fascism is superior to and dominates matter It is the desire to preserve and perpetuate the spirit that motivated the political movement behind FascismTo do so other mass other spirit had to be perceived as inferior incorrect defective deviant an impurity something deserving of eliminationJust as in metallurgy ore had to be refined the target metal had to be separated and the impurities discarded on the mullock heap of life or deathThe Fascist modus operandi was to send Jews to extermination camps Levi a Jewish chemist was fortunate to survive the experience because of the value of his scientific skillsTales of Militant ChemistryFor all the horror that the author experienced and witnessed his novel is not just a compendium of tales of militant chemistry It is an exercise in tolerance of those who would commit or permit evil as long as they are prepared to repent His message is one of forgiveness for those who acknowledge the wrong they didThe chapters are named after  elements I havent tried to analyse why each one of these elements was chosen or whether there is any significance in the order Im sure that if you were prepared to put in the effort it would be like understanding the structure of Joyces UlyssesThese are a Few of My Favourite ElementsThe novel starts with    an inert gas one incapable of aggregation with other elements Levi applies it to his Jewish family although he denies that they were wholly inactiveThe little that I know about my ancestors presents many similarities to these gases Not all of them were materially inerton the contrary they were  or had to be  quite active in order to earn a living and because of a reigning morality that held that he who does not work shall not eat But there is no doubt that they were inert in their inner spirits inclined to disinterested speculation witty discourses elegant sophisticated and gratuitous discussion    a rare but vital element applies to a brief love interest which never really eventuated because of the warWe are not dissatisfied with our choices and with what life has given us but when we meet we both have a curious and not unpleasant impression which we have both described to each other several times that a veil a breath a throw of the dice deflected us onto two divergent paths which were not ours   is the river Dora which represents youth joy life and friendship even when it is lost The    chapter details the reunion of two friends two positive heroes at the th anniversary of their graduationEach of us would gather more stories like this one in which stolid matter manifests a cunning intent upon evil and obstructionThe name of the element    derives from the Old Norse Vanadis which is one of the variants of the name of the goddess of love Freya or Freydis who might also be familiar to W T Vollmann fans It is the chapter in which Levi explores forgiveness and repentance a way out of the horror of the HolocaustThis is What MattersThe final chapter is    Here Levi acknowledges that his book is neither a chemical treatise nor an autobiography except to the extent that like every other piece of writing it is partial and symbolic Instead it is a microhistory with a scattering of sad tatters and trophies both failures and successesYet this chapter asserts how fundamental to life are atoms elements of the periodic table Carbon atoms travel from one form of life to another from an organic form to an intermediate inorganic form back to organic life Carbon atoms travel through time passing on their characteristics to other matter around themThe focus of this chapter is elements atoms molecules Chemical energy becomes mechanical energy and mechanical energy generates heat Such is lifeYet the great beauty of the novel is that it tells the story of people living loving giving birth parenting and perpetuating both life and love over the agesThis is matter This is what matter does This is what matters The Marvel of DiversityBy the end of the novel you marvel at humanity and its diversity You value each and every life No thing doesnt matter No life doesnt matter The novel subtly encourages you to care It makes you want to behave like you care Conversely you struggle to understand that Fascists might have looked at the same people as we do and didnt careThis novel is almost an afterthought to two earlier works by Levi about the Holocaust If This Is a Man and The Truce It even leaves gaps where the earlier books would have fit It houses them makes a home for them It is a periodic table into which these other elements fit perfectly This novel is rich in its own right but it invites us to read his other works to wander around the whole periodic table one element at a timeThe sense of this man Primo Levi who is now no longer with us makes me want to read his other works so that like an atom of carbon his legacy of vitality creativity love and forgiveness can live on transcending both his life and his death   I read this book several years ago and every so often see something about it here on GR Perhaps I will write a real review someday but I would need to reread itFor a real review of Levis book here on Goodreads check out httpswwwgoodreadscomreviewshow Levi is well known as a survivor of Auschwitz a writer of great talent and great humanity He died a probable suicide in I thought what Id do right now is give a link to a recent article in the New Yorker by James Wood Its basically a Levi retrospective and without mentioning the new book at all unless I missed it in a sentence presumably written to coincide with The Complete Works of Primo Levi published about a week ago in three slipcased volumes with an

{"title": "Cosmos",
"isbn": "0375508325",
"author": "Carl Sagan",
"text": "Cosmos has  heavily illustrated chapters corresponding to the  episodes of the Cosmos television series In the book Sagan explores  billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method mixing science and philosophy and speculates to the future of science The book also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history placing their contributions into the broader context of the development of modern scienceThe book covers a broad range of topics comprising Sagans reflections on anthropological cosmological biological historical and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial lifethat the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth                  httpwwwyoutubecomplaylistlist   I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of  and the world in the new millennium a strifetorn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the neutrinos being speedier than light particles experiment that had made the headlines a few years agoI can only imagine because he wasnt there to witness these watershed events and he isnt here to offer comment criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work  a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universes   It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the  chapters of Cosmos and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet I could write a review in the conventional format leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you canOr instead I could simply write about how despite being more than  years outdated Carl Sagans voice of reason rings truer than ever cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times I could just tell you how Sagans deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge  The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history the Soviet Union is no more America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President But turmoil in the world order persists  the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past if not more Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits blatant human rights violations infringement on freedom of speech and expression diplomatic armwrestling the everenthusiastic decriers of science War on Women the shouts of the globalwarming deniers reign supreme still The players may have changed faces but the game of petty oneupmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabatedWhich is why Sagans rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority impresses upon us a sense of urgency  that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced As the concept of nuclear deterrence receives a pat on the back the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars galaxies and universes The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominyIs it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes Democritus Aristarchus Hypatia Leonardo da Vinci Copernicus Galileo Johannes Kepler Tycho Brahe Christiaan Huygens Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete selfannihilationSagan thinks not   This is why I cant help but agree quite heartily with someone who says If I had a religion I would be a Carl Saganian  If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith let it be this one   The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book Gosh I should not use the term absolutely for something in which everything orbits around relativityAnyway I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars and expanding My ratingWhat a brilliant read this has been I have read it very slowly one chapter a week But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room bringing home and explaining to me the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable timeSagans mind is truly cosmic in scope and in outlook We accompany him as he pulls together history with the preSocratic the Alexandrians Leonardo Kepler and Tycho Brahe Huygens Einstein with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa in a true Pasolini manner I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his halfobservedhalffictional universe I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early s when Sagans program and book were all the rage and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitousI loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy UnforgettableThe contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universethe language of science which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions But a running argument and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies superstition and violenceProduced during the Cold War the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of selfdestruction His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projectionBut the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being But also how in spite of my own insignificance how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elementsRather than depressing I have found this thought heartening A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lastsWhich means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium invented by us Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian LibraryHe understood         httpssaudomarwordpresscom

           Im not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasnt already been said by countless others in the  years since its publication and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could But upon recently reading this book for the first time which may seem a bit belated but I am after all only  it instantly became one of my favorites a status not easily attained by any book and so I feel compelled to say something to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completelyOne glance at a book and you hear the voice of another personperhaps someone dead for thousands of years Across the millennia the author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head directly to you Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions binding together people citizens of distant epochs who never knew one another Books break the shackles of timePerhaps prophetically this is exactly the effect the late great Dr Sagan acheived with this book Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice which in large part I believe made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely albeit profoundly intellectual chat over coffee Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader but alsoand perhaps more importantlyaccessible making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undauntingAside from the beauty of its prose which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets and our far distant and recent in the grand cosmic scheme of things past to the possibilities for our distant future And yes because science is constantly evolving and as Dr Sagan states selfcorrecting some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading Not only can it serve as a friendly accessible and engrossing jumpingoff point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated it is also if nothing else worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oftphilosophical tidbits contained thereinWe are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to selfawareness We have begun to contemplate our origins starstuff pondering the starsMy only complaints about Cosmos are these the last two or three chapters lag just a bit incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary and somewhat lose the smooth easy flow present throughout the rest of the book and though I feel that in the current world political climate the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then I cant help but think that anybody above the age of  and possessing a fullyfunctioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war gamma burst radiation poisoning junk in the atmosphere nuclear winter death doom destruction we get it already However I can concede on this last point that at the time of publication the aftermath of a fullscale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic And in the grand scheme these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyabilityAll in all Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breathtaking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be and allows us to ponderwhen considering our own epic journey from starstuff to assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atomswhat it truly means to be human and what our place our purpose is in the vast expanse of this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky   "},

"author": "Rachel Joyce",
"text": " When Queenie Hennessy discovers that Harold Fry is walking the length of England to save her and all she has to do is wait she is shocked Her note had explained she was dying How can she wait A new volunteer at the hospice suggests that Queenie should write again only this time she must tell Harold everything In confessing to secrets she has hidden for twenty years she will find atonement for the past As the volunteer points out Even though youve done your travelling youre starting a new journey too Queenie thought her first letter would be the end of the story She was wrong It was the beginning While I was reading The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I often wondered about who Queenie Hennessy really was and why Harold Fry would make a trek walking hundreds of miles to see her before she dies  Rachel Joyce in this novel has answered all of the questions I had about Queenie and I now know that she was worth every mile that Harold walked and then some Queenie is in a hospice spending her last days writing a letter to a man she worked with at a brewery in an English town  At the same time that man  Harold Fry is on a walking journey to see her before she dies  We learn so much about Queenie in her letter  about her childhood her days at the university where she studied the classics  her losses  her time working with Harold and how she spent her days after leaving  living in a beach house and tending her beloved sea garden There should be nothing light about this story  A dying woman is in hospice writing a letter seeking forgiveness  New patients come and others die  But yet it was delightful to come to know some of Queenies fellow patients who will make you laugh as well as cry  These characters will steal your heart  The feisty and sometimes potty mouthed Finty  Pearly King  Barbara  Mr  Henderson Finty was my favorite as she takes to Twitter  Harold Fry Queenie Hennessy hospice  respect The story at some point becomes about more than Harolds walk and more than Queenies letter but about this group of patients and these lovely nuns especially Sister Mary Inconnu who types out Queenies notes and gives her so much more  They drink to Harold with their nutritional drinks and then the reality of it  Barbara wishes for one more Christmas  A particularly moving scene was when Sister Mary Inconnu helps Queenie to feel and smell a peach and taste it when she didnt think she could swallow  Harolds journey on the road and Queenies journey waiting for Harold becomes theirs as well  Thats it  then  said Finty  Its a unanermous vote From now on  no one dies  Were all waiting for Harold Fry This book is about living and dying with dignity  friendship  love  about regrets and acceptance  and how people have the capacity to make people who dont know them  fall in love with them I suppose that you could read Queenies story on its own since it really is not a sequel but has been called a companion piece telling the story of their journeys simultaneously I would say do yourself a favor and read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry in order to fully experience just how meaningful the lives of these far from ordinary people were to those around them Ill be thinking about the ending and that last letter to Harold for a long time  Thanks to Random House Publishing Group  Random House and NetGalley I really loved this book and while reading it I reread parts The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and after doing so decided that it was a  star book instead of  as I had originally rated it  I have changed my rating   I actually enjoyed this even more than The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry At first I was not so sure because Queenie came across as a very insipid and needy person and I wondered how she was going to sustain a whole book But then the story moved into the hospice and up popped all these marvellous characters I ended up enjoying the parts of the story about the hospice much more than the parts relating to her past life and Harold Fry The author achieved a remarkable balance between happy and sad and it was so good to see Queenie finally realise her life had not been so bad after all The end ties in very neatly with the ending of its companion volume Very well done indeed and I will certainly read more books by Rachel Joyce   As much as I loved The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I liked this one even more Both of these books contain the stories of ordinary lives made extraordinary because of the actions of the characters to connect with others Harolds story was his walking  miles to see Queenie before she died Queenies story was about her wait for him in the hospice to stay alive until he arrived Along the way we get both their historiesWaiting with Queenie are the other dying patients at the hospice and the gentle nuns who care for them Harolds postcards sent from the road give them all a small measure of hope that they too can hang on to await his arrival Where we get Harolds story from his thoughts and encounters along the road Queenie relates her history in a letter to Harold since she can no longer speak because of her tumor We know from the first book that Harold gets to Queenie just before she dies but there is a surprising twist at the end regarding her letterThis was a wonderful book with a lot of everyday wisdom that slips up on you as you read like this passage It has been everywhere my happiness  when my mother sang for me to dance when my father took my hand to keep me safe  but it was such a small plain thing that I mistook it for something ordinary and failed to see We expect our happiness to come with bells and whistles but it doesntIf you read Harold Fry you owe it to yourself to finish the journey with Queenie Oh and a special note to Rachel Joyce  I want Finty to have her own book   Not a    prequel or sequel but a parallel story told in Queenies firstperson narration as an extended deathbed letter as she waits for Harold to arrive The humortinged hardship of hospice life alternates with touching vignettes from her past Better than the original  more inventive allusive and intimateWhen I saw Joyce speak at the  Hungerford Literary Festival she mentioned that she wrote Harold Fry and Queenie Hennessy simultaneously emphasizing the idea that these two characters are journeying side by side In fact Joyce revealed that there are plot crossovers between the novels For instance towards the end of his walk Harold has to tape his yachting shoes onto his feet to finish writing her letter Queenie asks a nun to tape her pencil into her gripMy life has been small it has been nothing to speak of But the past is still inside me Harold I have never let it go It is a privilege to hear Queenies voice hereSee my full review at The Bookbag    This is my last read of While Harold Fry is walking through England and Queenie is trying to hold on and wait till he arrives before she dies she writes him a letter confessing secrets hidden for twenty years I liked reading Queenies story and about her unrequited love for Harold I liked the interaction between her and David Harolds son though I dont think Id have been as generous as she was I loved reading about her sea garden The writing is beautiful especially the description of the Northumberland Coast I sat with my suitcase and while I ate the bread and drank the water I gazed out over the bay The sun was high and threw stars at the sea The air shimmered with heat like a veil of water I was right there with Queenie This is a book about love and loss living and dying I loved this If only memory were a library with everything stored where it should be If only you could walk to the desk and say to the assistant Id like to return the painful memories about  and take out some happier ones please And also sometimes you cannot clear the past completely You must live alongside your sorrowSo I enjoyed the writing except for the intrusive f word that popped up at times Some of the people in the hospice were certainly characters and the nuns caring for them lovely But the main impression I was left with after reading this book is I hope and pray I never have to go into a nursing home or a hospice It sounds like my idea of hell   "},

anything happen to the unknown girlnot even if her fate impacts some of the most powerful people in EnglandFrom Dodgers encounter with the mad barber Sweeney Todd to his meetings with the great writer Charles Dickens and the calculating politician Benjamin Disraeli history and fantasy intertwine in a breathtaking account of adventure and mysteryBeloved and bestselling author Sir Terry Pratchett combines high comedy with deep wisdom in this tale of an unexpected comingofage and one remarkable boys rise in a complex and fascinating world It is impossible for me to read a new Terry Pratchett independently of the memory of the last  years of reading each eagerly awaited book one by one with utmost delight It is impossible for me to read a new Terry Pratchett without my vivid recollection of him eyes twinkling from under the brim of his hat as he signed my precious books and answered my breathless Mr it was ages ago Pratchett thank you so much for all the hours of reading pleasure with Madam thank you so much for all your money It is impossible for me to read a new Terry Pratchett without seeing the elephant in the room of the Alzheimers PCA variant looking for its heavy footsteps possibly crushing the words on the page and remembering how I sobbed when I saw his soulbearing BCC documentary about the cruel reality of his diseaseWhat Im clumsily trying to say is that its impossible for me to now separate the man from his writing and to separate his writing from my own life He is his writing it is the expression of his philosophy and his social conscience His writing has been a constant presence for more than half my life Discworld has been the stage for his social commentary one that has always resonated with my personal values One with a special humour Monty Pythonesque and quintessentially British in flavourDodger is very similar but uses Victorian London as a backdrop to highlighting the sweeping social changes of the times the contrast between classes and the striving of a few more privileged persons to understand the marginalised and deprived sectors of society It is fun it is a romp it has wit and wisdom and eloquence It is thoroughly researched and authentic in setting with artistic licence and language modern USA persons are going to struggle with many of the wordsSir Terry is definitely still with us the elephant is browsing quietly I wish you well Sir Terry you are a treasure and my life is very much richer for your contribution and your continued presence    A couple weeks ago I was having a real pisser of a day Then I remembered there was a new Terry Pratchett book out and things didnt seem so bad anymore When I first started to read it I got two surprises The first was that it wasnt a Discworld book Which Im fine with given how much I loved Nation The other surprise was the language of the book To be completely honest and Im really embarrassed to admit this when I started reading the book I thought that Terrys Alzheimers had finally progressed to such a degree that it had really damaged his ability to write at the sentencelevel About two pages in I realized he was actually mimicking Victorian prose which is a lot different than his usual breezy style of writing Once I realized that it only took about three pages to get used to the new style and enjoy it After that I didnt find the language clunky at all In brief all Pratchetts usual wit cleverness and humor is here Theres also the added benefit of seeing Victorian London through Dodgers eyes and while Pratchett romanticizes it somewhat he obviously knows the time period well    First a disclaimer As virtually a lifelong Pratchett fan I would probably buy anything he publishes If he were to release a book titled World of Poo I would probablyoh NevermindThe point Im making is that I cant be objective when it comes to this author  the Discworld books are too much a part of my life I cried while watching TPs deeply personal euthanasia documentary I know certain Discworld characters better than I know members of my extended familyBut this is a review of Dodger  not an essay on why I love DW  so here it isThough colourful and engagingly written this isnt a very good bookIt isnt awful and there is plenty of fun historical trivia but I wouldnt recommend it Instead I would steer newbie readers to the City Watch William dW or Moist vL episodes of DiscworldThe most glaring problem here is the GodmodeGary Stulike protagonist In the space of approximately a week the teenage tosher sewage scavenger with questionable personal hygiene receives not one but two fairygodfather like makeovers and is accepted by the cream of London society at a fancy soiree wins the heart of a beautiful multilingual Princess despite barely exchanging three sentences Middle aged women are also apparently magnetically drawn to the young urchin  throwing themselves at the teen demanding kisses in exchange for their assistance displays the fighting skills of Greebo the skinny teenager easily outmanoeuvres the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and professional assassins is recognised as a national hero and showered with money by grateful citizens who provide free coach rides in exchange for his autograph meets Queen Victoria probably the most powerful person in the world at that time  and is accepted as virtually her equal Although to be fair this occurred several months after his ascension to national heroThe other problem that I have is the use of real historical figures such as Dickens Mayhew Disreali Robert Peel etc I got the impression that Sir Terry included people he respects and admires and perhaps this is part of the problem overlooking the implausibility of these gentleman all happening to take an interest in Dodger during a single week the characters never really came to life for me I got the impression that I was reading about cardboard placeholders for the real men rather than the living breathing and flawed characters that inhabit TPs other novelsAnd this brings me to my next issue which is possibly controversial the historical figures were all middleclass or wealthy dogooders concerning themselves with charity towards the deserving poor There was no mention of working class figures of the industrial era organised labour movement  the movement that would culminate in arguably the biggest ever shift in British society the postwar Labour victory that led to the NHS radical redistribution of wealth the grammar schools and free University education  all of which would have fundamentally shaped TPs childhood and adult opportunitiesPerhaps it isnt surprising that these working class heroes  who were fighting for a fairer society for everyone  were not included Because Dodger is fundamentally a ragstoriches tale where the audience is asked to empathise with and applaud Dodgers rise to join the upper classes while throwing out the occasional sixpence whenever he feels a twinge of guilt Appropriately the book ends with the new Sir Dodger engaged in the robbery of a priceless historical treasure a tiara once belonging to Marie Antoinette No he is not intending to sell it and distribute the money to the many starving orphansgirls driven to prostitution who populate the book in an Animal Farm like ending Dodger is stealing Marie Antoinettes tiara for his new wife a former Princess Great lesson for the kids TerryDespite the above issues this could have been an engaging read if the antagonists had been more fleshed out something that Pratchett is normally incredibly good at If we had been introduced to the Outlander and her possibly conflicted henchman earlier and been led to feel truly terrified and slightly awed by the assassins ruthlessness and cunning as well as sympathy for her henchman it might have broken up the Gary Stuness of the tale it might also have given us a true sense of fear for Dodger and Simplicity Additionally it would have been a chance to show us early Victorian Britain a through the eyes of an outsiderLastly wtf was up with Dodgers mentor Solomon When we first meet him he is apparently so downatheel that he lives in a slum and eagerly awaits Dodgers scavenged scraps of meat a few chapters later and it turns out that he is known and well spokenof by the most influential and wealthy people in the country  he exchanges a secret handshake with Prince Albert and shares a laugh with him regarding their mutual acquaintancethe King of Sweden Willing suspension of disbelief can only be stretched so farUltimately this can be viewed as either a competently written watereddown Dickens fanfic Dodgers real name is Pip Stick he grew up in a workhouse etc etc or a not very successful attempt to deconstruct the Dickensian novelIt can also be viewed as an inspirational tale for children which teaches them to um steal from the innocent for personal gain vandalise the property of people who happen to be from the same country as one bad apple and elope with a girl you hardly know  who happens to have lovely hair And not to bother with school or even basic literacy  because crime is so much more rewardingAnd yet despite all of the above and my disappointment in Snuff for fairly similar reasons Ill continue to buy any new Pratchett novel in the hope that it contains some of the old Discworld magic  moments of which though few were still present here Which is probably what his publishers are banking onAt least there was less scatology in this one   Dodger by Terry Pratchett narrated by Stephen Briggs I listened to this on audio and I dug the narrator I dug him a lotThis book was funny and fun A lot of the humor was laugh out loud funny and a lot of the fun was in spotting the real folk amidst all the fictional charactersI had a blast listening to this and if I could afford it I would listen to the entire Discworld series narrated by Mr Briggs Alas I cannot so I guess I still have to read them   Without wanting to get in to yet another debate with  something adults about the legitimacy of said adults reading novels meant for tweens is there another author working in the YA field who treats said YAs with as much respect and intelligence as Terry Pratchett I seriously doubt it If there were I wouldnt hold the publisher manufactured genre in such contemptDodger is most assuredly a YA novel a softening of Pratchetts usual intelligent discussion of humanity and witty banter but not to the extent that it is painful to read for those of us with a more adult reading level Taking his most wondrous creation of AnkhMorpork back to its roots the documented reality of Victorian London and exploring the origin and nature of many of his past favourite protagonistheroes once more this time in the form of the cheeky geezer tosher extraordinaire Dodger Dodger follows the well trodden path of Vimes Carrot and most recently Moist von Lipwig from inauspicious beginnings through a series of sticky adventures to come up smelling of roses I dont think it is a coincidence that Pratchett often writes mysteries as they are perfectly suited to the somewhat grey heroes he likes to createIn this adventure Dodger saves the life of a damsel in distress one stormy London night and sets in motion a series of events that will change both of their lives forever taking in several historical figures along the way Sir Robert Peel Henry Mayhew Benjamin Disraeli Charles Babbage Joseph Bazalgette Angela BurdettCoutts and VA themselves are amongst the celebrity cameos shoehorned in to the story all of which irritated the cynical side of me who will usually abhor this kind of shortcut to bond with a lazy reader but Pratchett goes about it in such a way that it is both entertaining and educational they are there for a reason not just because its cute and gimmicky whereas the first appearance of a certain Mister Charlie Dickens made me groan quite loudly in exasperation and sadly it never felt important to the plot that this particular character be Charles Dickens in my opinion there is never really a reason for using Dickens or Poe amongst others in your fiction but the author should at least make proper use of the baggage such a famous historical figure carries and for once Pratchett disappointed on this countAs with almost all Pratchett novels this is a wonderfully entertaining and fast paced read that surely will not disappoint anyone Dodger is another first class example of a master storyteller in full command of his abilities Once more two middle fingers are being stuck up firmly in the face of the disease currently at battle with Terry Pratchett and long may they continue to do so   "},

"author": "Cheryl Strayed",
"text": " NATIONAL BESTSELLER SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTUREAt twentytwo Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything In the wake of her mothers death her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed Four years later with nothing more to lose she made the most impulsive decision of her life With no experience or training driven only by blind will she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State  and she would do it aloneTold with suspense and style sparkling with warmth and humor Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened strengthened and ultimately healed her I finished this book a couple of days ago and have not been able to get it out of my mind I was happily coming to Goodreads to give my glowing review but was pretty annoyed at a few of the recent reviews so I wanted to address that first The bravery and honesty that flowed from those pages touched me deep into my soul and to see her described as dimwitted and self absorbed is insulting to the author and to those of us who were moved by her story If you want to read about a well planned trip by a prepared hiker who has no issues go and buy a guide book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail Im sure youll find it very informativeWild is a beautifully descriptive story about loss pain nearly giving up and pushing on I felt like I was right there next to Cheryl my pack so heavy my feet bleeding and sore filthy hungry and lonely I couldnt believe she kept going but also would have been crushed if she hadnt I loved every moment of this book and am just blown away by the authors audacity and courage I will probably never be able to go three months in the wild but I sure loved living vicariously through Cheryl in her Wild    starsWhat kind of dimwit would decide to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail alone with zero backpacking experience Apparently the same kind of dimwit who would try heroin just because the stranger she spent the night with happens to need a fixIf you can tolerate essence of dingbat and overlook her lousy choices and even lousier excuses for those choices this is actually an enjoyable read You have to roll your eyes a lot while working to the point where she hits the trail but after that its quite engaging I admire her tenacity in finishing what she started given her cluelessness about backpacking that led to serious mistakes and potentially dangerous miscalculations If youve never backpacked before use this as a cautionary tale rather than an excuse to be a ditz Many people with more backpacking savvy than Cheryl have lost their lives through poor planning or just bad luck The thing that saves this book is that Cheryl writes well If I can say without unkindness that theres a certain charm in her idiocy this is what makes her story worth reading And if you have any backpacking stories of your own youll connect with so many of the little things that define the worldwide community of backpackers    I have read a great many criticisms of this book by people who either expected it to be solely about the PCT itself or were offended by the authors use of coarse language and discussion of her sexual proclivities And thats fine all of those readers were obviously seeking something other than what this book had to provide Myself I enjoyed it from cover to cover A longtime lover of the PCT I already know about the trail from end to end I was more interested in how the author used a rather spontaneous journey along the trail to help herself face demons and come to grips with her mothers death There are moments where her emotions are so clearly spelled out on the page and then there are times where you have to read between the lines But every step of the way youre alongside her watching as she learns to accept to embrace to let go and how the PCT weaves through thatThis is a book I will most definitely read multiple times over the years I almost regret buying it in Kindle format because I can think of at least five people Id love to loan it to and demand they read it immediately   I know what Cheryl felt like on the Pacific Crest Trail because I felt like that reading her book Neverending Arduous But without that whole enlightenment part Warning Spoilers Wahhh I did heroin and cheated on my husband and my lifes a mess Wahhh Im too tired to even masturbate Wah I slept without protection and got an abortion I lost my toenailz I have godzilla skin on my hips because my backpack weighs so much Had sex anywayz BTDUBS I like sex Seriously she had this problem with sleeping around with men and toward the end of her trek shes STILL sleeping with strangers Her body made all these changes but shes STILL the same person on the inside So pardon me for not finding that inspirationalHer mom died and I feel super bad about that But I couldnt really follow Cheryl on her journey because I just cant connect with a half ass femmeNazi Its fitting that she had a hard time reading a real compass because her moral compass was also offkilter Should have read about Bill Brysons trek across the Appalachian Trail instead   EDIT  I changed this from two stars to one because I realized that its been about two years since I read this book and I still get ragey and fistshakey just thinking about how much it sucked So bonus star deducted This book sucks on wheels Read on for moreOkay I gave myself plenty of time to cool off before writing this review because man was I ever pissed at this book by the time I finished reading it And I really wanted to love it Im a backpacker and Ive often fantasized about doing the PCT solo a pretty stupid idea for anybody whos not much more experienced than I am I was excited about a memoir of one womans experience on the trail I dug into this book eagerly but within a few chapters my enthusiasm began to deflate and by the end I was basically doing this at every other paragraphAfter some coolingoff time I gave it what I feel is a very generous two stars That bonus star is for the first couple of chapters which do in fact pull a person in and which do share some impressive openness on the authors part I was particularly impressed with her ability to share her weird dreams about killing her mother which were raw and real and touching and disturbing Also the scene where she recalls how view spoiler the horse is put down  was particularly affecting Otherwise this book just doesnt have all that much to offer Cheryl Strayeds life doesnt so far have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments  the kind of things that make for good memoir reading Or if her life does contain those things shes not a good enough writer to make the reader feel it Brief rundown Strayed lost a loving parent with whom she had a great relationship and had a very difficult time accepting that loss Not particularly different from the experiences of many people Ive met As a result of her grief she lost all impulse control and sabotaged her marriage to a really wonderful man then started using heroin Okay thats a little more interesting but unfortunately the full impact of these momentous choices is lost in an unblazed forest of vague unremarkable prose and confused chronology making it hard to give a damn At the nadir of her downward spiral she hears about the PCT and just decides to hike it which is not surprising I guess since shes proudly established that she suffers from a total lack of impulse control a condition she never really seems to try to correct throughout the course of the book So hike it she does all unprepared derping off into the wilderness as is par for the course apparently She cant even be assed to read the essential and very short I might add book Staying Found The Complete Map and Compass Handbook an absolute essential for anybody who determines to walk off into the wilderness and survive by whatever she can carry on her back Oh she bothered to buy the book but she neglected to read even a page of it on the flight from Minnesota or wherever shes from to southern California although she brought it on board the plane intending to educate herself BEFORE she began her blissedout hippie walkabout But I guess hey free peanuts and a bad Adam Sandler movie soIf youre getting the impression from the review that this memoir fails mostly because Strayed just doesnt make herself a very sympathetic character youre getting the right idea But it gets worse Once she actually gets the high of hiking under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT for gods sake the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature WalkEverybody  yes literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her She is that irresistible all hairy and smelling like a sasquatch and hobbling from miles of carrying half her body weight All the men she meets eye her appraisingly Most of them hit on her and ask her out for dinner and drinks waitdinner and drinks on the Pacific Crest Trail Yes more on that later One of them actually does seduce her with the erotic power of his Wilco tshirt But the one message she clearly wants you to take away from her allegedly inspiring story of a complete personal transformation on the PCT is that the author is preternaturally sexy and virtually nothing with a penis can resist her Strayeds relentless hotness actually becomes such a prevalent theme that I began laughing out loud each time she described yet another man expressing his interest in her hot hiker self I laughed a lot O Reader I laughed a lotDont worry those people she met who didnt want to stick their trekking poles into her worshiped her for other reasons Every single person she met except for some Totally Grumpy Old Camp Hosts and a couple creepy hunters who still wanted to have sex with her couldnt stop telling her how amazing and wonderful she was for hiking the PCT alone Without any knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness Everyone said things to reinforce her belief that she was a badass motherfucking Amazonian queen Hooray The world is your oyster cause thats all the world isHow did she meet so many people hiking one of the leasttrammeled of the worldfamous trails on the continent Well Strayed actually didnt hike all that much of the trail She started well north of the Mexican border and had to take a Greyhound around most of the High Sierras because it was socked in that year and she was unprepared for snow hiking as she was for most other contingencies She got rid of her ice axe after crossing one small snowfield figuring she wouldnt need it again yknow where the elevation got higher Jesus Christ Not that she really knew how to use an ice axe anyway Her intent was to do only the California stretch not the entire trail though she did extend the trip through Oregon after she found out about the impassability of the trail another thing she should have checked on before she started walking So she motored through a good  miles of her hike and left the trail for various reasons at various points to hitchhike instead Thus she ended up with a lot of nonhiker people in a lot of nonhiking situations making this more a memoir of disjointed hippie travelbyanymeans than a memoir of HIKING THE EFFING PCT as all bookbuyers were led to believeThe parts of the book that actually DID take place on the Trail were interrupted by flashbacks to her life with her mother or the destruction of her marriage or her experimentation with heroin or the fallout from these events So much so as soon as she began actually talking about the Trail again I knew to brace myself for yet another forced emotional flashback to the ordinary tragedy of Strayeds typical American life Now in spite of the choking Mary Sueism of the authors selfdepiction I could forgive her utter dumbness in wandering onto the PCT unprepared if she actually learned anything about what a bad idea it is to wander into the wilderness unprepared If her unpreparedness for the PCT taught her how to be a better person more aware more focused more capable more responsible more honest about herself GREAT Bring on the stupidity I like a good redemption tale But it didnt It didnt If it did those passages were lost in editing or were never written at all The books big climax involves Strayed eating a peach in a grove of azaleas and its all very pretty and a deer walks into the clearing and she realizes thatview spoilerBut even thateven that I could forgive if the writing were good I will forgive anything for gorgeous writing My favorite book of all time is Lolita and I can forgive the existence of a fictional character like Humbert Humbert because damn have you ever read Lolita Strayed has at least once and apparently learned nothing about the value of lovely writing But the writing in Wild is if you will forgive the pun pedestrian at best I suppose its serviceable enough for a general memoir of an American woman having a typical American experience of loss and confusion and coming to accept her past But for describing nature Ugh I wasnt expecting Annie Dillard hefts a Kelty from this book but one would think that a book which alleges to focus on the great transforming power wilderness would at least give a little time or effort to you know wilderness Miles and miles of trail are dismissed in the tritest and most cliche of short sentences and as far as describing action Strayed often resorts to such apprentice work as we kissed and kissed and kissed I walked and walked and walked I cried and cried and cried I yawned and yawned and yawned I raged and raged and raged The most vivid scene of actual trail action I can recall is where she falls asleep beside a muddy tarn and wakes to the feel of frogs hopping all over her body The rest of the prose fell utterly flat particularly in scenes involving nature What a crashing disappointment And what a ripoff since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT And there is virtually none of that hereIts no surprise to me that this book was selected for Oprahs Book Club  no less Oprahs selections have become over the years increasingly vapid and serving only the rahrah you go girl branding of the Club I remember long ago in a distant past when she actually chose books that had good writing and fascinating characters I should have been warned off by the fact that this book was picked but I wanted so so badly to read a wellwritten memoir about the enchantment of backpacking about the way the strife and the loneliness and the rawness of nature pull the packer into another realm of existence where life is fragile and valuable where the sky and the earth and the line of the trail itself live and by turns cradle and sustain the hiker and try and reject her Instead I got gee my feet hurt The great American memoir of the PCT still remains to be written Im sad that its not already here that I dont get to read it Im elated that maybe Ill yet have the chance to accomplish what this book didnt accomplish Maybe Ill get a chance to write it Im already planning my own trip from Mexico to Canada Not solo though Thats just dumb Who knowsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   "},

definitely an overuse of put one foot in front of the other that verged on becoming a drinking game the premise of the story is lovely but it did get a bit schlocky and mitch albomy for my tastes mentions of both facebook and twitter in the book were curiousedited to add pasted in from my comment below in case people dont read the comments hereyou know the further i get from reading this book the more it is sitting with me in a way that is far deeper than i originally stated its an introspective story and deals with a lot of issues quietly  but i have been thinking about the story off and on for the last several days i think it would make for a really good inperson book club discussioni had the chance to meet joyce and hear her read and talk about the book shes a lovely woman and believes so strongly in harold that you cant help but wish the very best for both of themas far as the booker it would be very interesting if sheit won its not the typical book for booker  its a simple  sentimental story but its touching a chord with many many people that shouldnt sway the judges though its a tremendous achievement to have accomplished a longlist spot with a first novel amazing    I have just browsed through a bunch of reviews that are literally glowing with praise so I feel rather embarrassed that I cannot be more enthused about this novelI was really taken in by the premise and rather enjoyed the beginning of the book probably until celebrity hype and disciples befall HaroldFrom that point on I started to find the book predictable if not a little trite even I also think that while I have nothing against a good dose of pathos this may have bordered on the overdose I am very sorry I feel this way but I do but I do   Harold Fry has never done the unexpected

to walk across England from Kingsbridge to Berwick Upton Tweed to save herWith nothing but the clothes he is wearing and the small supplies he buys along the way Harold slowly makes his way across the country Along the way Harold will initially be critical of himself as he sees himself alone in the world thanks to uncertainty that he had all throughout his life from a young boy a father to David and then with a wife he no longer communicates with Its only when he begins going out of his comfort zone by talking to others along the way that he soon discovers the sad and beautiful truth that he is not alone and there are many people just like him that are struggling to put one foot infront of the otherBut for all the profound sorrow Harold encounters this is not a sad read Rather it suggest that new beginnings can always be found and it is never to late to do something extroidinary British playwright Rachel Joyces first novel is an endearing debut full of emotion I found myself riding all the emotions with Harold and was willing him on all the way At the heart of this is a story of a simple man a threadbare marriage and a fractured country All of this makes for an unforgettable and thoughtful story Do yourself a favour and take a walk with Harold a simple man who will get into your heart and leave you with a smile from ear to ear   "},

Nest by Ken Kesey I lay awake for a long time afterward watching the bars of light on the ceiling holding my eyes open until the pupils dilated enough to shrink the light then Id blink and have to start all overFinally I sat up and turned on the lights The book had done something to me Like itd punched me in the face and said Do something you idiotSo I gathered up a bunch of sentimental shit from around my apartment stuffed it into a backpack hiked across town and threw it off the Morrison BridgeThe backpack made a loud thunk when it hit the water Like a body falling from a building I watched it float downstream a tiny dot weaving through the rippling reflections of the city lights until it finally sank below the surfaceI tell you this story because in a way throwing that bag of stuff off the bridge is the best analysis I can make of Keseys bookSo much has been said before what else can I sayChuck Palahniuk summed it up nicely in the forward for the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition He explains that Cuckoos Nest tells the same story as the most popular novels of the last century it focuses on the modern paradox of trying to be human in the welloiled machine of a capitalist democracy where you must be either a savior or a slave Palahniuk points out that Cuckoos Nest shows us a third option You can create and live in a new systemnot rebelling against or carving

touch the place where he was tattooed to see if he was still alive Hes layin awful quiet I told myself I ought to touch him to see if hes still alive  The evil in this book Nurse Ratched I usually have a fond spot for the villains but this woman scares me She has got to be one of the top baddies of all time I still have goosebumps from her  Ive always been hit or miss on books that are called classics and thats probably why I have not tried some that now Im beginning to reconsider Because if they are like this one Im definitely missing out Thanks Ed for pointing out this most wonderful book to me   Hed shown us what a little bravado and courage could accomplish and we thought hed taught us how to use it     I have a lovehate relationship with this book The writing and imagery are superb and I always love a down with tyrannical overloads generic living and medicalization moral but its other lesson leaves me cringing In the basic knowledge I have of Ken Kesey the book ultimately seems very misogynistic and antifeminist Im all for a gender balance but this book botches up the entire process in a method that purposely lacks tongueincheek flair Basically the plot seems to involve men mentally castrated by a domineering woman who could just as easily be labeled Bitch as she could Big Nurse Enter main characterwho in my tattered yellowpaged s copy directly labels him as the hero of the book on the back covera man that pretty much shakes the men up to the supposed feminization of American culture and how its destroying their identities as males Read here a huge characterization of the male ego is to dominate the female with opposites all aroundHow is this man so easily labeled a hero Have we forgotten he has been charged and convicted among other things with rape of a female minor And the main reason hes in the asylum is to skimp out on his prison sentence How is that masculine if I am to continue on with the stereotypes the book itself perpetuatesand yet backpedals when necessary Why do we consider him the main character when the story is being told in the first person by a Native American Can you not be a mana herounless youre white Or perhaps it was because he was so docileIn the end the supposed hero of the book teaches men that to cast off impending feminization one must be violent towards women muscle them out of the way destroy them if theyre relentless If you are unable or fearful of doing so youre better off killing yourself than being only half of a man Oh but wait theres a special lesson for the ladies themselves too To steer clear of the eventual rape assault murder or tortureand yes it will happensimply sexualize yourself Thats the only way to be safe andisnt it convenientsecurely a woman So much for individualization and going against cultural norms gentlemen Youre a dime a dozenBefore we glorify such a book we have to sit down and figure out what exactly masculinity is outside of a cultural setting before we can complain that culture itself is taking it away Are we to allow a cowardly violent lookingoutforNumberOne individual give us this definition fair and balancedIts one thing for him to say it its another for us to listen   one flew east one flew westThis classic book gave birth to a movie which won a truckload of Academy Awards This means the majority of readers are familiar with one or the other and I thought a very brief review would be enough something along the lines The book is very good Seeing that some people miss the point of the story I had to ramble a little more than this short sentence sorry A ward of a mental hospital in Oregon was ruled by an iron hand of its head nurse Ratched She even had power over the doctor of the ward The patients were completely under her thumb until a rebellious guy called McMurphy was committed for the treatment He decided to challenge the nurses rule for completely selfish and notsoselfish reasons I mentioned the movie This is one of the rare and very precious occasions when the movie was as good as the book In case you have not seen it but like the book drop everything and do it now Those Oscars I mentioned in the beginning they are welldeserved I also believe Jack Nicholson was born to play McMurphy No actor in the world  dead or alive  could do a better job I really did not want to use the movie stills in my review as countless other people did it in theirs but I also thought it is impossible to talk about the book without mentioning the movie By the way I saw it before reading the book Later when I read it I realized I cannot put it down even though I knew what would happen next at any moment This should tell something about how good the book is Another points for the book I really hate stories told in present tense This time it took me about one quarter of the tale to realize this one was in present tense as well I simply had not noticed that before being busy literally living in Nurse Ratcheds ward When my mother got her hands on this one she was sure she would not like it being a doctor and as such familiar with goingson in psychiatry hospitals Several pages later I realized I had to wait for her to finish it to resume my own reading  her having an advantage of seniority and all Unlike the movie the book is told from Chief Bromden POV  this by the way made a nice surprise in the middle of the movie He is without a doubt mentally disturbed in the beginning and as such it is possible to see him as an unreliable narrator this would open a can of worms and a whole new level of speculation what if not everything he told really happened Aside from his obvious delusions that is I will not go there We now come to the main reason I decided to write a longish review the Nurse Ratched I heard two types of argument  She is a strong woman doing what she thinks is best and as such cannot be a villain thus McMurphy is the one If the Nurse is a villain how comes there is no other strong woman on a good side My answer for the first argument would be yes she is undoubtedly a strong woman Being a strong woman does not make one a good person by default The fact that she believes that everything she does is for the greater good makes her even scarier  and she is scary no doubt about itFor the second argument I can only say that there is no place for a good strong woman in the story We are talking about a male ward so she cannot be one of the patients She also cannot be one of the nurses as the head nurse surely would not let a strong woman into her domain she really does not want a competition So to have another strong woman only as a tribute to political correctness would be pointlessI will stop here TLDR too long did not read version of the review book  great read it movie  great see it     Really unpopular opinion coming your way Escape while you can How much of life is defined by choices and how much is determined by fate Or is really fate that directs lifes order or is it peoples thirst for power to remain strong Does the rabbit live in a hole because the wolf decided so What happens when the rabbit decides to challenge the wolfSuch thoughts are provoked by this widely read and loved classic novel The messages buried in an unexpected setting a mental institution revealing the grim aspects of such an institution striking metaphors and symbolism which I detected early on in the first part of the story the part I genuinely enjoyed Meeting Mc Murphy the rabbit that challenged the wolf felt like listening to the wisest philosophy teacher explaining juicy stuff about life with expertise wit and charm and reading the story in the perspective of Chief Bromden a patient feigning deafness made it even more interesting Its clear to me why several of my friends loved the novel Let me link you to their excellent reviews Partheeeys Ninas and Ate ShelbysUnfortunately the significant themes of the novel for me were overwhelmed by the strong sexist and racist undertones until the actual meanings of the story got lost behind the chauvinistic approach I found the story ironic because instead of feeling empowered by a woman character who is the boss at a mental institute where majority of population are males she is depicted as a controlling unreasonable and heartless freak with oversized chests in a matriarchal world where all the women are no good unless they provide sexual service It was very saddening and frustrating because I believe the author was driven by a conscious effort when he deliberately wroteinsinuated such messages in his novel The demoralizing climax added insult to injury and ultimately the reason I went for two stars It would have been just a star if not for the redeeming although really depressing conclusion answering the most important of the above questions In the battle between the rabbit and the wolf its the bird who fled for freedom that wins I should have just read Harry Potter     "},
{"title": "Life of Pi",
"isbn": "0770430074",
"author": "Yann Martel",
"text": "Life of Pi is a fantasy adventure novel by Yann Martel published in  The protagonist Piscine Molitor Pi Patel a Tamil boy from Pondicherry explores issues of spirituality and practicality from an early age He survives  days after a shipwreck while stranded on a boat in the Pacific Ocean with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker It is not so much that The Life of Pi is particularly moving although it is It isnt even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once which it is as well And its certainly not that Yann Martels vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin even though they are It is that like Bohjalian and Byatt and all of the great Houdinis of the literary world in the last few moments of your journey  after youve felt the emotions endured the moments of heartache yearned for the resolution of the characters struggle  that you realize the book is not what you thought it was The story transforms instantly and foreverAnd in those last few chapters you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as wellYou feel Martels words lingering suggesting and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith  hoping for white light and love Or the agnostic who  in trying to stay true to his reasonable self explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms lacking imagination to the end and essentially missing the better storyThere is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from India left adrift in the Pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his fathers zoo in Pondicherry There is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not indeed what the book was about at all There is no use because depending on your philosophical bent the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you There is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grandRead this book Not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent It is of course But there are many good authors and many good books While uncommon they are not endangered Read this book because in recent memory  aside from Jose Saramagos arresting Blindness  there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements As Pi says in his story Life on a lifeboat isnt much of a life It is like an end game in chess a game with few pieces The elements couldnt be more simple nor the stakes higher It is the same with Martels undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger A simple story with potentially life altering consequences for its readers As Martel writes The world isnt just the way it is It is how we understand it no And in understanding something we bring something to it no Like Schroedingers cat in the box the way this book is understood the way it is perceived affects what it is There has been some talk that this book will make its readers believe in god I think its a question of perspective To behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements the dry yeastless factuality of what actually happened is certainly one way to go about it But to understand this piece to be something indescribable something godlike is by far the greater leap of faithOh but worth the leap if the reader is like that atheist willing to see the better story   I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious I tend to avoid the winners of the Man  Booker  they make me a little depressed The only Carey I havent liked won the Booker Oscar and Lucinda I really didnt like the little bit of Vernon God Little I read and I never finished The Sea despite really liking Banvilles writing So being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start unfortunatelyIm going to have to assume you have read this book as if I dont I wont be able to say anything about it at all Apparently when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up Well good on him Thats just great I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism The book is written by a member of that class of people who are my least favourite a religious person who cannot conceive of someone not being religious There is some fluff at the start in which atheism is discussed read discarded as something people inevitably give up on with their dying breath But the religious are generally terribly arrogant so it is best not to feel insulted by their endless insults  they know not what they doParts of this were so badly over written that it was almost enough to make me stop reading The bit where he is opening his first can of water is a case in point This takes so long and is so incidental to the story and written in such a cutesy way that I started to pray the boat would sink the tiger would get him  I would even have accepted God smiting him at this point as a valid plotting point even if or particularly because it would bring the story to an abrupt endThis is a book told as two possible stories of how a young man survives for  days floating across the Pacific Ocean told in  chapters That was the other thing that I found annoying  much is made of the fact this story is told in  chapters  but I could not feel any necessity for many of the chapters Just as I could not feel any necessity for the Italic voice that sounded like Tom Waits doing What is he building in there Well except to introduce us again to Pi some number of years later You know in Invisible Cities  Calvino has necessary chapters  this book just has  chapters It was something that annoyed me from early on in the book  that the chapters seemed far too arbitrary and pointing it out at the end just made me more irritated There may well be some Hindu reason for  chapters  but like Jesus ticking off the ancient prophecies on his way to martyrdom I still couldnt see why these chapters were needed in themselvesPi is the central character in the book who for some odd reason is named after a swimming pool  I started playing with the ideas of swimming pools and oceans in my head to see where that might lead but got bored He is an active practicing member of three of the worlds major religions There is a joke in the early part of the book about him possibly becoming Jewish ha ha  or perhaps I should draw a smiley face The only religion missing entirely from the book is Buddhism Well when I say entirely it is interesting that it is a Japanese ship that sinks and that the people Pi tells his story to are Japanese engineers Ive known Hindus who consider Buddhists to be little more than dirty filthy atheists  so perhaps that is one reason why these Japanese engineers are treated with such contempt at the end of the bookThe Japanese make the connections between the two stories  but we can assume that they stuff up these connections While it is clear the French Cook is the hyena Pis mum is the orangutang and the Asian gentleman is the zebra Im not convinced Pi is meant to be the tiger In fact the one constant thats a pun by the way you are supposed to be laughing in both stories in Pi My interpretation is that the tiger is actually God Angry jealous vicious hard to appease arbitrary and something that takes up lots of time when you have better things to do  sounds like God to meThe last little bit of the book has Pi asking which is the better story the one with animals or the one he tells with people I mean this is an unfair competition  he has spent chapter after chapter telling the animal story and only the last couple telling the people story The point of this though is Pascals wager said anew If we can never really know if there is no god and it ultimately makes no difference if we tell the story with him or without him in it but if the story is more beautiful with him in it  then why not just accept him in the story and be damnedWell because the story isnt improved with the animals and life isnt just a story and kids stories are great sometimes but I often like adult stories at least as much  and sometimes even more This is yet another person all alone survival story but one I dont feel that was handled as well as it could have been  mostly because the writer had an ideological message that he felt was more important than the story  never a good sign Worse still in the end I really couldnt care less about Pi  I knew he was going to survive and knew it would be because of his faith He does talk about Jesus most petulant moment with the fig tree  so I was quite impressed that rated a mention  but all the same I havent been converted to any or all of the world religions discussed in this bookCompare this tale with the bit out of A History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters about the painting  I know it is not a fair comparison Barnes is a god but Ive made it anywayI didnt really enjoy this book I felt it tried too hard and didnt quite make it But Christians will love it  oh yeah  Christians will definitely love it   I was extremely surprised by this book Let me tell you why its a funny story On the Danish cover it says Pis Liv Pis Life but I hadnt noticed the apostrophe so I thought it said Pis Liv Piss Life and I thought that was an interesting title at least so perhaps I should give it a go So I did And what I read was not at all what I had expected I thought it was a book about a boy in the Indian slums or something It actually wasnt until I looked up the book in English I realized the title wasnt Piss Life I was deceived for the longest time and well not only about this When I first read it I also thought it was based on a true story Im not sure why I thought that I must have misread something I vaguely recall thinking the prologue was instead an introduction It was a sad and ehm slightly humiliating day when I discovered the truth lay elsewhere I guess your romantic beliefs must die someday and that was the day for meSee its easier to believe in the world and be optimistic about it when you also believe that world capable of containing a boy and a tiger coexisting on a lifeboat for  months and surviving The truth is this book probably changed my life not in any grand extraordinary way But with the small things the small observations Like how he was afraid to run out of paper to document his days in the lifeboat and instead he ran out of ink Like how he chose to embrace three religions not just one This book and Pi especially represent and embody a way of life that I admire Its not about believing in God but about what it takes to believe in something anything really Yourself the world goodness life God If it seemed real enough for me to believe it had happened perhaps the real world is indeed a place where it could happen And thats what I want to believe even if real life might tell me otherwise    Sift a pinch of psychology with a scant tablespoon of theology add one part  Island of the Blue Dolphin  with two parts philosophy mix with a pastry blender or the back of a fork until crumbly but not dry and there you have Pi and his lameo cheesed out boat ride to enlightenmentActually I liked the beginning of this book loved Pis decleration and renaming of himself his adding religions like daisys to a chain and was really diggin on the family as a whole and thenthen then then the tarpaulin I did learn some things though I learned thata cookies work wonders in assuaging heated argumentsb Tiger turds do NOT taste good no mater how hungry you are and hold absolutely no nutritional value actualy this might apply only to turds obtained from tigers that have been floating on rafts for several weeksmonths I think Ill apply it as a general ruleI wanted to like this book more  I loved the cover and then theres that little golden seal that keeps going psst psst you dont get it  its waaaay deep you missed the whole point But I think no I got the point like a  by  to the forehead I got the dang pointWhat I lack in spelling this author lacks in subtlty I felt like the ending was a study guidecliff notes pamphletwikepedia entry all in one I love Pi in the first rd I understand the merits of Pi in the raft just not my thing but pi in the last bit  ugh ughugh Im chocking on the authors shoving of moral down my throat  help help I cant breath stars for the beginning negative  stars for the ending add something or subtract to make it equal a positive   and there you have my  starred LIfe of Pi review   Life of Pi was a fairly engaging story in terms of plot and character but what made it such a memorable book for me at least was its thematic concerns Is it a story that will make you believe in God as Pi claims Im not sure Id go that far but I would recommend it to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of reality and the role of faith in our lives To me the entire thrust of the book is the idea that reality is a story and therefore we can choose our own story as the author himself puts it So if life is a story we have two basic choices we can limit ourselves only to what we can know for sure  that is to dry yeastless factuality  or we can choose the better story I suppose in Pis world the better story includes God but he doesnt say this is the only meaningful possibility In fact Pi calls atheists his brothers and sisters of a different faith because like Pi atheists go as far as the legs of reason will carry them  and then they leap Pis point in my opinion is that human experience always involves interpretation that our knowledge is necessarily limited that both religious belief and atheism require a leap of faith of one kind or another  after all theres so little we can know for sure For Pi then we shouldnt limit ourselves only to beliefs that can be proven empirically Instead we should make choices that bring meaning and richness to our lives we should exercise faith and strive for ideals whatever the object of our faith and whatever those ideals might be Or as Pi says in taking a shot at agnosticism To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation In the end however I didnt necessarily read this book as an invitation to believe in God Instead I saw it as a mirror held up to the reader a test to see what kind of worldview the reader holds That is as Pi himself says since it makes no factual difference to you and you cant prove the question either way which story do you prefer Which is the better story the story with the animals or the story without the animals Or as I took it Is it my nature to reach for and believe the better but less likely story Or do I tend to believe the more likely but less lovely story What view of reality do I generally hold Another equally important question is this How did I come by my view of reality Do I view the world primarily through the lens of reason Or do I view it through the lens of emotion For Pi I think its safe to say his belief comes by way of emotion He has as one reviewer noted a certain skepticism about reason in fact Pi calls it fools gold for the bright Pi also has what I would call a subtle but real basis for his belief in God namely an intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose But belief still isnt easy for him Despite his trusting sense of purpose Pi acknowledges that Love is hard to believe ask any lover Life is hard to believe ask any scientist God is hard to believe ask any believer So its not that a life of faith is easier in Pis opinion its that for him belief is ultimately more worthwhile This is not to say however that Pi holds a thoroughly postmodern view of God or that he believes as a matter of art rather than in a sincere way True Pi suggests that whether you believe his story had a tiger in it is also a reflection of your ability to believe in something higher And of course its easy to read Pis entire story as an attempt to put an acceptable gloss on a horrific experience Still there are a number of clues throughout the book that give the reader at least some reason to believe Pis story did have a tiger in it for instance the floating banana and the meerkat bonesAs such Pis two stories could be seen as an acknowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith and therefore its up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest Hes not necessarily saying that the truth is what you make it hes saying we dont have unadulterated access to the truth our imagination personalities and experiences unavoidably influence the way we interact with the world But thats not the same as saying whatever we imagine is true I think Pi for instance knows which of his stories is true Its not Pi but the reader who is left with uncertainty and who therefore has to throw her hands up and say I dont know or else choose one story or the other And to me this isnt too far off from the predicament we all find ourselves in And thats what makes Life of Pi such a challenge to the reader Pis first story is fantastic wonderful but hard to believe Yet theres some evidence that it happened just the way he said it did And Pis second story is brutal terrible but much easier to accept as true Yet its not entirely plausible either and it leaves no room for the meerkat bones or Pis trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose If the reader personally dismisses the tiger story out of hand I suppose thats another way of saying the reader by nature tends to believe the more likely but less lovely story In the same way if the reader gets to the storys payoff and still believes there was a tiger in the boat the reader is probably inclined to believe the more emotionally satisfying story But it should be born in mind that Pi doesnt definitively state which story was true something which only he can know for sure All we can really be sure of in Pis universe is that he was stuck on a lifeboat for a while before making it to shore So which story do I believe I struggled with that question for a long time But after thinking about it for a couple of days Ill end this review with the final lines from the book Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr Patel and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger

forces his crew to evacuate the planet while thinking him dead Mark finds himself stranded on Mars surface completely alone with no way to signal Earth that hes alive And even if he could get word out his supplies would be gone years before a rescue could arriveChances are though Mark wont have time to starve to death The damaged machinery unforgiving environment or plainold human error are much more likely to kill him first But Marks not ready to quit Armed with nothing but his ingenuity and his engineering skillsand a gallows sense of humor that proves to be his greatest source of strengthhe embarks on a dogged quest to stay alive using his botany expertise to grow food and even hatching a mad plan to contact NASA back on EarthAs he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next Mark begins to let himself believe he might make it off the planet aliveBut Mars has plenty of surprises in store for him yetGrounded in real presentday science from the first page to the last yet propelled by a brilliantly ingenious plot that surprises the reader again and again The Martian is a truly remarkable thriller an impossibletoputdown suspense novel that manages to read like a reallife survival tale Crap My astronaut crewmates accidentally left me behind on Mars Im fucked Im going to die Oh wait I just thought of something highly logically unlikely and technically complicated that I am sure to pull off without a hitch because did I mention that I am Plucky and Ingenious It sure is a good thing that I am supertalented Yay That worked Im not dead Next chapter But wait Disaster has struck Shit happens when youre stuck alone on Mars Whatever shall I do OMG I just had a great idea Its a good thing Im so naturally optimistic because it sure would make for a bummer book if I ever showed any signs of being depressed or having any kind of mental deterioration after spending nearly two years in total solitude Nah Ive got the fightin spirit I can create a life support system out of duct tape What does Mars actually look like Is there anything interesting from a scientific perspective about it Who cares Im busy growing potatoes in shit and watching Threes Company Did I mention that disco sucksRepeatFor a whileI do not get the hype   Unpopular opinion time I dont like how this book is written Watneys journals read like a nerdy blog rather than a dramatic survivors diary Its hard to find something harrowing and traumatic when the protagonist is saying yay a lot and making incessant corny puns  pirateninjas Yay oxygen Lol gay probe lol Bad rover no Scooby snack LOL craaaaaaap For me those arent funny theyre almost embarrassingNo matter what horrible thing is happening to Watney hes sure to pull though but not before laying a smug cutesy zinger on us It sucks all the tension out of any situation which is the complete opposite of what I want in a book thats supposed to be a thrillerNow dont get me wrong Andy Weir is a great technical writer When Watney isnt being a wacky douche hes going on and on about some technical or mechanical or biological process that with me not being a scientist usually goes over my head And thats fine I have no fault with a book thats factually complicated like that In fact its really admirable and cool that Weir is able to pool all of his expertise into a book about survival on Mars That being said other aspects of the book suffer According to the authors bio on the back of the book Andy Weir was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since He is also a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of subjects like relativistic physics orbital mechanics and the history of manned spaceflight If I can stereotype here it shows My guess is that he doesnt really know how people behave or interact in the real world The dialog is stilted and awkward The characters are all onedimensional and flat They almost seem like an afterthought The emotional and psychological trauma rendered by all these neardeath experiences and complete and utter isolation What trauma Theres no mention of that anywhere Watney is apparently that cool and awesome of a guy as evidenced by all his canned laugh track oneliners and grating sarcasmBut hey maybe that doesnt bother some people obviously considering that people actually watch The Big Bang Theory and theyre in for a technologicallydriven funny spacethriller Because I have to admit its a terrifyingly cool premise It just wasnt what I was expecting I was hoping for an emotionallytaxing horrifying survival drama but instead got a cutesily witty astrophysics manual Just because something is nerdy doesnt automatically mean that its good   This book was fantastic A thrilling survival story with a hearty dose of humor The main character Mark was such a smartass and I LOVED IT The voice and the premise hooked me in right away and kept me thoroughly engaged the whole time My only real issues were that some of the minor characters didnt really stand out as much as they couldve and some of the science heavy bits were a little hard to follow and felt infodumpy at times But the human aspectthe heart of the storywas totally on point and for the most part I just had a great time reading thisOverall this book was exciting and fun and oh man am I excited for the movie I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes survival stories or funny thrillers or scifi with an emphasis on the sci   I have never wanted so badly for the characters in a book to be real I want to meet them all the way I want to meet the president or Taylor SwiftThis story is perfectly told It is perfectly paced it is brilliantly written it is beautifully craftedAndy Weir does this incredible thing where he make the reader feel the isolation that Mark Wagner feels and he does it so subtly we dont even realize that hes doing it until its doneThe Martian completely captivated me I couldnt wait to find out what happened next and I never wanted it to end   First off welcome to Lets kick this year off with a review of a book about a guy who deserves to survive more than anyone Ive ever known This book has been lurking around in my Goodreads feed gaining hype and all the positive reviews from my friends eventually got too much for me  so I had to check this out for myself Im glad I gave inThe Martian has so many good things going for it First and foremost it is a classic tale of survival against very huge odds In this book Mark Watney becomes one of the first people to walk on Mars but after an accident causes him to be believed dead and abandoned by his crew it looks like he will be the first person to die there Like Cast Away x a million Mark must battle extremely foreign territory the likelihood of starvation and the possibility of technical failuresIts pretty hard to see an outcome where he isnt totally screwedThe best thing about this book is the juxtaposition between the very scientific nature of everything Mark must do to survive  gave me a renewed level of respect for how damn smart astronauts have to be  and his absolutely wonderful personality Mark maintains his sense of humour throughout every hardship he faces  its pretty much impossible to not be charmed by himHere are some quotesThe screen went black before I was out of the airlock Turns out the L in LCD stands for Liquid I guess it either froze or boiled off Maybe Ill post a consumer review Brought product to surface of Mars It stopped working This book is part serious sciencefiction part an hilariously dark comedy that imagines a horrifying situation infused with humour and the overwhelming human desire to stay alive Its hard to imagine that anyone who picks this up wont find themselves dragged into Marks world desperately needing to know what will happen to himBlog  Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  Tumblr   "},

propels him into a world he never dreamed existed There are people who fall through the cracks and Richard has become one of them And he must learn to survive in this city of shadows and darkness monsters and saints murderers and angels if he is ever to return to the London that he knewA fantastic story that is both the stuff of dreams and nightmares San Diego UnionTribune Neil Gaimans first solo novel has become a touchstone of urban fantasy and a perennial favorite of readers everywhere I didnt enjoy this book as much as I should have I kept distracting myself with the thought Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans books Then I would have to tell myself to shut up because Im reading one right now and I can return to berating myself laterNeil Gaiman really understands fantasy He understands that it isnt elves dancing in a forest and drunk dwarves mining for gold with improbably well maintained beards No fantasy is a reflection of reality but fantastic It isnt an alternate reality but reality through the lens of imagination and possibly some mind altering substances Not only does he capture the essence of fantasy perfectly but he does so with the trickiness and charming language that seems to be uniquely in the realm of British humorists He rarely describes anything in a completely straightforward manner instead choosing to almost fool the reader into visualizing his delightful or when appropriate very undelightful characters and events I couldnt help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into London Below right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans booksSo a few years later and a lot of people seem to like this review still Ive decided to abuse the popularity of this review to attempt to steer fans of Neverwhere towards a few other books that I think they will enjoy Despite the theme of the review being Read more Neil Gaiman the books listed below are actually by different authors since I think Ive already made it clear that you should read more Neil Gaiman So aside from all of those here are a few other recommendations Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart  An epic hilarious mythological adventureWool by Hugh Howey  A pretty dark and serious tale of people living underground on a ruined world The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson  A globetrotting adventure set among a lovingly researched historical backdrop  Little Brother by Cory Doctorow  A nerd finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly being stalked by his own government and doesnt think its so cool   Neverwhere was my first real introduction to the world of urban fantasy  a clever take on Alice in Wonderland one can say set in the semimagical unsubtly dangerous and quite fantastically warped world of London BelowNeverwhere is one of my alltime favorite books It has just the right amount of wild imagination inexplicably somehow still grounded in firm reality a healthy dose of absurdity and strangeness remarkably colorful largerthanlife characters unforgettable setting that is more of a character than a simple backdrop and of course sufficient amount of lovely dry humor Besides there is that certain something in Neil Gaimans writing that keeps bringing me back to his works  that cleverness I guess that boldness in his approach to writing that apt descriptiveness that burns scenes into your mind without becoming boringly detailed or repetitive and the bit of mesmerizing darkness he harbors in all of his works regardless of the theme or target audienceIn Neverwhere Gaiman uses the old technique of taking a person belonging to the regular world and throwing them into the midst of a fantastical reality using the protagonist as our eyes into this world  think of Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz or its younger siblings like Mivilles Un Lun DunRichard Mayhew is a timid and perfectly average London guy who suffers from a noticeable lack of figurative backbone  and the only time in his life he does show some of that illfated backbone combined with some very real compassion he gets himself into trouble that is waaaay over his head Let Richard tell you about it himself  Unwittinly having thwarted an assassination attempt on a young girl named Door and having helped her because lets face it hes basically a decent guy Richard suddenly finds himself in the London Below  a place for those who no longer belong to the regular London Above a place for those who have slipped through the cracks of ordinary reality It is a place that exists outside of our conventions of time and space touching our reality but not quite overlapping itJust like London Above London Below is a melting pot  except for this one is for relics and discards and misfits of all kinds of times and legends and beliefs and tales It is a place for those who fell between the cracks  think of those you usually do not notice even if you walk past them on the street like the homeless for instance they are already invisible to us It is also a place for those who spent too much time in the company of the supernatural and for those who dont fit in our world You can view it as a colorful tapestry  or more aptly as a dirty filthy rag made of mismatched and threadbare bits and pieces that once were something grand and even now create a mesmerizing albeit puzzling effect through their sheer strangeness and unexpected combinationAnd it is a place that has teeth and is ready to bite It is harsh and cruel full of menacing dangers lurking around every corner Friends can quickly turn into foes and promising a favor is a serious thing that can get you far in this world It takes skill to survive hereAnd Richard is very much NOT prepared for thatLondon Below is a place populated with creatures that have enough color and flair to them to easily stand out against the drab background of life and their surroundings Of course Im talking about Marquis here the notsohonest and yet brave and loyal for a reasonable price of a favor Marquis de Carabas the guy who you would ultimately want covering your back in a sticky situation as long as you can overlook the fact that he may have had something to do with creating the said sticky situation in the first place  With characters like Marquis or the enigmatic singleminded Hunter or pretty much anyone Richard comes in contact with in this weird mixture of rooftops and sewers and underground tunnels London Below is a confusing blur to Richards tired and overwhelmed senses Some things dont make sense Others make way too much sense are way too literal Earls Court or Knightsbridge for instance He is so out of place here its almost painful to read as you wince and cringe at his pathetic attempts to clutch to what he continues to view as safety and sanity And no this sanity does not normally involve girls named Door or a charming scoundrel Marquis de Carabas or Angel Islington or outwordly hired thugs Croup and Vandemar or Rat Speakers or Beast of London or the real Old Bailey or the nonexistent British Museum underground station where Earls Court can get you if you so please   But eventually Richard may just may start discovering something about himself that is a bit more adjusted in the world that has slipped through the cracks than real London In other words Richard Mayhew just may have gone native Unlike Dorothy and her Toto he may not want to just live happily ever after in his version of KansasAfter all havent we all at some point asked a question about what is the meaning of all that we are doing Havent we always wondered whether there ay be something else we may be better suited to be and do Havent we wanted to escape somewhere well else Different Isnt that some of the reasons we wan t to immerse ourselves into worlds of fantasy at least for a short while  Usually however the point is to return home enriched by experiences of the outwordliness and of course gain some appreciation for the life we used to take for granted before Because of course no matter how much we want to we will never escape the real life Or can we After reading this book I know I would want to had I been in Richards place But I cannot and so I appreciate my mundane uneventful life  but what if I didnt have to Who knows   I first started reading this book and honestly wanted to just chuck it in the bin I said very mean things about the protagonist under my breathSurely I said a Protagonist means that they are pro and totally into furthering the story Surely Protagonist is the similar to Proactive and ProductiveI was wrong The word Protagonist in its basic form is not similar to proactive It simply from the Greek plays means the principle character or the first speaking characterHowever I maintain that the kind of protagonist that most people want to read about is one that actually bloody does somethingHistoryLanguage lesson overNeverwhere is a book that TRIES to be clever and magical In many senses it utterly manages to be magical and creative and fun It fails however to be clever There are so many lines in this book intending to be dry wit and just come off dry stupid Allow an exampleThere are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr Coup and Mr Vandemar apart first Mr Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr Croup second Mr Croup has eyes of a faded china blue while Mr Vandemars eyes are brown third while Mr Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens Mr Croup has no obvious jewellery fourth Mr Croup likes words while Mr Vandemar is always hungry Also they look nothing at all alike Oh I see what you did there Kat laughs slapping her knee with her hand in amusement No not really If hed left out these lame little lines I think I probably would have enjoyed this novel a whole lot moreJust about every other character in this story is awesome except for the protagonist Give me a story about Marquis de Carabas and I will read it in a second Honestly fantastic character right there Tell me I have to read another whiny missive about Richard Mayhew and I will likely stick hot pokers into my eyes firstI get it I really do Its a journey He has to LEARN and GROW and CHANGE But he takes a REALLY long time to do it and he only ever grows to be slightly less pansy soft and annoying The total character growth comes to equal someone who doesnt just sit idly by and let people take stuff from himLet me give you an example He met a girl who was unconscious in the streets and bleeding to death He takes her home This causes his fiancee to break up with him He then goes through a lengthy process to get the girl back where she came from Once he does this he then loses his job his apartment and all his money He then goes to find the girl for a an explanation and b help Without her help he will probably die as another side effect of having met her is that he has two psychopathic killers on his tail She simply apologizes and walks away abandoning him So what does he do Does he chase her down and gently remind her that she owes him a favor Does he barter and trade what he can whilst trying to lure the killers into a trap so that he can some how defend himself No I will now transcribe from the book EXACTLY what he doesRichard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps echoing away and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping station of East London and the sewage works Shit he said And then to his surprise for the first time since his father died alone in the dark Richard Mayhew began to cry He decides to stay there and die Thats right folks He just stays there waiting to die BoofuckinghooYa know I dont accept this crap from a female character  nor do I accept it from a man How the hell am I suppose to sympathize with someone who so blithely lets everything he has slip through his fingers because he cant speak up and demand explanations or some kind of help This level of pitiful doesnt help the audience empathize  it makes them think your protagonist is an idiot The plot is pretty good  despite everything being painfully obvious and predictable at the end The world building is fantastic Its probably the best thing about this book Its really creative and fascinating and interestingOver all it was an alright read It wasnt great I labored through until the last half where it began to pick up and markedly improve Thus only three stars Had the first half been more like the last half then it would have earned four   Picture Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Really good books right Now imagine if someone took the first book and mad libbed characters settings monsters etc so that you were left with the exact same story except instead of travelling the galaxy with your crazy friend and the most powerful man in the universe you were travelling in haunted British sewers with a nerds wet dream of a Xena warrior princess rival and a Gothic princess who can unlock doors sigh I dont think there is much of a coincidence either because Gaiman wrote the Hitchhikers companion in the early s as well as conducted interviews with Adams while he was alive not to mention took writing tips from him The only saving grace for me with this book was the fact that there someone actually made a miniseries on the BBC of it that is actually so bad that it makes the book look half way decent Between all the cliche characters cheesy narration and formulaic plot its just not worth your money or a read especially when Hitch Hiker exists already Ive said it before stick to American Gods and The Sandman when it comes to Gaiman   There are two Londons Theres London Abovethats where you livedand then theres London Belowthe Undersideinhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world Now youre one of themWhat if there is a secret underworld hidden in the dark below the busy noisy streets of London What if Earls Court is truly the court of an earl and the name of Angel station derives from a real angel On a fortuitous night Richard Mayhew finds a mysterious young girl wounded in an alley and it is the first step on a journey to the world of NeverwhereNeil Gaiman is an author thats been on my list for a long time and I must say this was not anywhere near what I had expected His writing style is more flowery which translates to better in my head than I had feared and the premise and plot of at least this book was a lot less weird and more mainstream than I had thought As a whole that made me think of this as a somewhat remarkably wellwritten book with unremarkable characters storyline and settingAs an inhabitant of London albeit a temporary one this book of course came with an enormous appeal I decided I had to read it before I moved again and Im glad I did The fantastic fictionalisation of the Underground is both wonderful and enough to change my view of London The tube stations Earls Court Angel and many others now carry new meaningsIn the end Neverwhere is a very enjoyable but largely unimpressive book Not many people see this as a favourite among Gaimans works but its a good book that Id recommend to anyone who has been to London   "},

PROBLEM Pope Francesco I says Gentle souls why not When I first picked up this book decades ago I expected it to be another in a long line of highly entertaining Ludlum thrillers Four hours later I couldnt remember the last time I had laughed so much so consistently This is the second funniest book written by Ludlum top spot goes to its sequel The Road to Omaha It is completely out of character for Ludlum and yet somehow fits within his established styleFollowing the mad capers of General MacKenzie Hawkins who despite being Americas most revered and decorated soldier is now persona non grata perhaps having something to do with a series of events involving urinationa Chinese monument the top of the American embassy and brass balls the novel ups the crazy at every turn bringing a healthy dose of laughs with it The story is told primarily through the eyes of Samuel Devereaux hotshot lawyertobe who gets ensnared in Macs ridiculous plan to kidnap the pope Sam echoes every thought you might have as the reader sometimes stumbling for words just like you might You read every page to see if he can restore sanity to the plot and save the world but theres a bit of glee that comes with the realization that that will never happen because thats just no funThe book is a fun light read and sure to keep you entertained the entire time   This was fun I added another star for Brick the reader I swear he read this at times in an eerie but entirely apt imitation of Arlo Guthrie Jr doing Alices Restaurant No music or four part harmony but still It was fun  fit perfectly in with the tongueincheek storyThe Hawk was a great character as were they all A friend said it was a bit misogynistic but I didnt get that impression at all The Hawks women gorgeous exwives who still liked  respected him were definitely characters in their own rights  were shown through the appreciative eyes of the young lawyerThe twists were fun  audacious Pure entertainment Highly recommended in this format   I was cleaning out my basement the other day and found a pile of old Robert Ludlum books from the s and s Ludlum of course was the master of the thrillerconspiracyspy genre of those decades I picked up Road to Gondolfo and began reading it again after over  years of collecting dust and I couldnt put it down A typical Ludlumesque fastpaced thriller but also extraordinarily funny I had forgotten that Ludlum was equally renowned for his humour and wit as well as being the master of the spythriller genre I was laughing so hard I almost had tears in my eyesThe basic premise follows General MacKenzie Hawk is a living military legend a hero and a rogue Sam Devereaux is a bright young exHarvard lawyer now in the army and he cant wait to get out When the Hawk gets kicked out of the army for conduct unbecoming of an officer his options are limited  but not for long He has a plan a plan so ambitious it will shock the world and make him a very rich man He is going to get  million dollars  a dollar from every Catholic in the world And hes going to do it by kidnapping the Pope A great fast paced and humorous read  strongly recommened by yours trulyCheersFred   I am reviewing the thriller The Road To Gandolfo by Robert Ludlum which is a very good novel which I bought from a car boot sale Robert used to be the biggest selling author in the world and his books were so successful he didnt have to even write a novel every year He is an ex film producer and he tends what you might call intelligent thrillers This book is a little bit more light hearted than his usual stuff and in the introduction he says it was great fun to write This book was written in  when the Vietnam War was coming to a close This book is set in the near future at that time and the plot is their is a General who is being dishonorably discharged from the army Apparently he has shot the testicles off an important statue in China and although he admits he probably did do it he claims he was drugged and set up and didnt know what he was doing The Americans are in important negotiations for trade with China and dont want to upset them so decide he must go Apart from being a General he is a war hero who has served in every major American conflict starting with World War  The lawyer assigned to defend him is due to leave the army and the  become good friends despite the lawyer being involved in a previous case the General doesnt approve of They form a company to collect and sell religious artifacts Their search leads to a prominent member of the Catholic Church who served in Monaco during World War  and was staunchly anti Nazi despite pressure from those around him This story is a bit like Indiana Jones and they are determined to wreak revenge on the Chinese I did quite enjoy reading it and its around  pages so is a reasonable length    This book was first published in  and the authors name given as Michael Shepherd Turns out it was written by Robert Ludlum using a pseudonym at the mandate of his editorpublisher so as not to smirch his well known name It was reissued several times and the paperback I have is the  issue According to Ludlums introduction this arrangement gave him the freedom to unleash his staggering imaginationThe plot is way over the top and features an army general named MacKenzie Hawkins who concocts a scheme to kidnap the pope and hold him for ransom Ive read Ludlums novels in the past and enjoyed them notably the series about Jason Bourne but this book just doesnt compare In fact Im giving up on it after about eighty pages Its just too ridiculous and Im not able to take it seriously Im giving it the benefit of a doubt by rating it a generous three stars   "},

"text": "In the jungles of Vietnam Bob Lee Swagger was known as Bob the Nailer for his highscoring target rate at killing Today the master sniper lives in a trailer in the Arkansas mountains and just wants to be left alone But he knows too much about killing The mission is top secret Dangerous patriotic and rigged from the start One thing goes wrong doublecrossed Bob has come out alive Now he is on the run His only allies an FBI agent in disgrace and a beautiful woman His only hope find the elusive mastermind who set him up Multilayered with nonstop action this hotshot torcher of a thriller is addictive exciting and right on target A hightech highride reading experience I like this book There are things in it that bug me a bit but on the whole nothing that really requires commentBob Lee Swagger is a solitary man who lives alone in the Arkansas hills with his dog and his rifles He loves to shoot though he doesnt hunt for meat anymore as since the war hes lost his taste for the kill something Ive come to share Maybe its an age thing to Bob is part of the so called gun culture He reads gun books he loads his own ammunition and works at accuracy He keeps to himself since he was disabled out of the Marines Sergeant Swagger was known as Bob the Nailer He was one of the deadliest snipers in the theater of operations Now hes called back offered a job that someone knows he wont be able to turn down Only things arent what they seem Those whove contacted him are not what or who Bob has been led to believe and hes to be the fall guy Only the ones who plan to set him up dont know Bob Lee If youve seen the movie Shooter its based on this novel There are some a few fairly major differences For one thing the movie is set much later Bob Lee Swagger is a Vietnam Vet in the movie hes placed in a later era While there are fairly major differences in the book and movie I suspect anyone who likes one will like the other The liberties taken with the story arent used as so often happens to rewrite Bob Lee or any of the storys key points Enjoy both as sort of complimentary stories or possibly two similar stories where some of the characters happen to have the same names What can I say here Im a shooter and I suppose that shooters might be slightly more prone to like the book but I truly believe anyone who likes action novels will enjoy it While there are some details as to ballistic performance and some detail on the rifles themselves there isnt so much as to drive away those who arent aficionados Actually most of this touches directly on the plot Youll get to know Bob Lee as well as Nick and some others well including our villains but you wont be overwhelmed with information You wont come away knowing what Bobs favorite food is or if he has hangupsand Bob would look at you like you were from some other planet if you asked You will get to know what you need and in some of your cases youll have known people like Bob LeeThe story is fast moving slowing only slightly in a couple of places and it holds interest While there are a lot of action novels out there this one is moderately original Ive actually set out to find books like this once and while a few are close so far Ive not come up with any other than by this author that Id say are like it I suspect that readers will either like and identify with the protagonist of this one or not understand him much at all and not really like him Maybe nottry it and see I think youll like it if you like Vince Flynn Don Pendleton Harold Coyle Tom Clancy Larry Bond and others I call this an action novel it could also be called a thriller and will fit into either category Im not really fussed about pigeonholing it Whatever you call it its not dull I like this book I plan to put it on my shelf with my keepers and have already taken steps read reserved with one of my favorite book stores or ordered where I couldnt find one in town the next  books in the series about this character I recommend it  stars EnjoySince I wrote this I got all the Bob Lee books Note on Stephen Hunters booksI have reviewed several of his books and have liked some more than others I have a concern and Id like to put this out for what its worth The books are sort of a mixed bag There are two that I rated  stars but one I rated  and put on my favorites list That one is I Sniper which is book  in the Bob Lee Swagger series It occurs to me that if someone is less than thrilled with one of the books in the series before  they might never move on to that novelLet me suggest that even if you have been less than thrilled with one of the other books and have pulled away from the series you give I Sniper a try With lots of action a good cast and some great humor I think its so far the bestthough the jury is still out on Time To Hunt  as I skipped it and am about halfway throughso far its excellent   I had read the novel Hot Springs by Stephen Hunter several years ago and had been pleasantly suprised by the quality of the work And then about a year later I saw the movie Shooter starring Mark Wahlberg and once again came away pleasantly surprised I realized that the movie was based on the novel Point of Impact also by Stephen Hunter but beyond that I discovered the two were related in a unique way The main character in Hot Springs was Earl Swagger with at least three books in that series while the protagonist of Point of Impact is his son Bob Lee Swagger the lead character in a seperate series That mix got me interested in pursuing other novels in both series to discover what happened between the two seperate time framesIve got to tell youas much as I enjoyed the movie Shooter I was absolutely blown away no pun intended by the novel that it was based on This book is a major tour de force as they say combining the best elements of action histakes crime great settings and noble and slimy characters alike This is the first of the Bob Lee Swagger novels and what a character Trained by the marines to be the soldiers soldier and refined to be one of the best snipers in the world his past almost becomes a character in itself as he is forced to deal with events beyond his control This is a highenergy wellplotted story that isnt always headed where you think it is definitely one to keep you turning the pages into the wee hours of the morningIm so glad there are quite a few books left in this series and at least two more in Earls series as well for me to sink my teeth into   Before I start a review of this book theres two caveats that I should probably address The first is that I have a deep and abiding interest in guns and all the information that surrounds them which makes the information in this booklength of pull turned case necks all kinds of manufacturers and statistics that are too numerous to namea pleasure to read about rather than a chore Its not everyones cup of tea and I know and respect that But this is my own opinion and it was just the icing on the cake for what is already a very well written book The second caveat is that I already saw the movie which was loosely based on this novel called Shooter and starring Mark Wahlberg Having seen it I could at many times predict what was going to happen and had a more intimate knowledge of the charactersAnyway on to the good stuffI dont read a great deal of what youd call thriller novels One or two on occasion usually while Im on vacation In the past a great deal of Tom Clancy which I always feel inexplicably guilty for having read Dont ask me why But reading thrillers on the whole is something that leaves me feeling like my time could have been better spent as if there were novels with deeper plots better developed characters generally more complexity to themPoint of Impact however ignored all my feelings and went straight for the kind of themes I love and threw in some truly memorable characters along with plot twists that just kept catching me by surprise I read it in two days after I first picked it up and like any good book it would not let me go whether because I wanted desperately to know if one character or another was still alive or whether I viciously hated another and wanted to see the main characters bring him to justiceone way or anotherA lot of people give Bob Lee Swagger the main character of this book a bad rap for being who he is Sure hes a backcountry hermit who lives with his guns and devotes himself to them as one might a lover and to most that will make him irredeemably crazy But anyone who focuses on that is ignoring several important details not the least of which is the fact that the US Marines teach that kind of singleminded dedication to ones weapon and that Swagger has used this dedication to overcome vices such as drinking to excess To be sure his character is painted in broad strokes at times and when he lapses back into a Southern drawl for long periods where it seemed before that he hadnt had it before it can be a little hard to take with a straight face But hes not what youd call stereotypical He reads some of the famous nature writers like Emerson and Thoreau He writes and types because he enjoys it and has a gift for itthough many do not see it in him And he has a gift for hard work not just in terms of shooting but of planning along with the nearly inhuman patience required for the setup work of longrange shotsI wont detail the other characters too much but suffice to say that there are some that I adore and some that I loathe and while only a couple feel as real as Bob I think thats all the reader really needs The real centerpiece of the book is the plot in any caseWith conspiracies that run so deep and wide they make your head spin strategies and tactics that seem to defy the abilities of human reasoning and enough plot twists to keep you consistently on your toes Point of Impact is typical of the thriller genre But what makes it believable is the scale the plot isnt to end the world not to wipe out an entire country Its to kill one man and save the asses of a few people who by all rights should be in jail or on death row Given the world we live in today thats a lot more believable and makes the book seem a good deal more realistic and down to earth Apart from the rifles theres not much gadgetry either Even the bad guys are crammed into musty old trailers not much better off than the characters theyre huntingI wont say that this book is perfect Theres not a few points where I grew bored while I was reading particularly during FBI agent Nick Memphis long blocks of description Bob grew to caricature proportions on occasion and some of the feats that he accomplished were simply too big to be believable But if you manage to forgive these small mistakes youll find Point of Impact to be a rewarding book that will take you for a hell of a ride     stars Last half is good action suspenseFor the first  pages  I was depressed and stressed I had trouble sleeping at night It was too much hopeless helpless victim feel because innocent man Bob Lee was framed for murder and on the run THEN it changed and the rest of the book was exciting and hard to put down Bob Lee was on a mission of retribution  revenge The bad guys were worried There was a happy ending for the good guys which I liked But I did not like one thing at the end I did not understand why someone destroyed evidenceThere are a lot of technical details about rifles and guns Some readers will like that others wont I dont know anything about guns but it sounded good to me Someone compared Bob Lee to Jack Reacher The Bob Lee story was more realistic Reacher requires more suspending disbelief Also Reacher doesnt have the depressing and stressful effect that caused me to feel bad for a couple daysBob Lee Swagger was a top sniper in the Vietnam war This story begins twenty years later Bob lives with his dog in the Arkansas mountains The second herogood guy is Nick an FBI agent whose boss Howard cares about appearances instead of substance Howard is like systemic poisonDATANarrative mode rd person Story length  pages Swearing language strong including religious swear words but not often used Sexual language none to mild Number of sex scenes  briefly referred to Setting around  various US locations Copyright  Genre suspense thriller   Bobby Lee Swagger is a loner He likes things simple just him his dog and the cold silence of the north He also has a talentnot to sing or dance but to shoot and kill He was a sniper for Uncle Sam one of the best in the world But when the government comes calling and presses on Bobby Lees I love my country button he must heed the call But thanks to his daddys teachings and how Uncle Sam has treated Bobby in the past he takes no chances and takes steps to ensure that he is protected He has been asked to line up a shot at the President not to actually take him out you see just to see if it can be done So of course he does as he asks and tells them how when and where it can be done When an actual shot is fired and the President goes down the clock starts ticking on Bobbys life After all it was his gun his bullets and the shot that he himself lined out to the security detail so he must have done it Only Bobby Lee knew he hadnt committed the crime and was prepared to give his life in order to prove his innocence Along the way he manages to pick up a low level FBI agent and a pretty little nurse Not much of a team against the huge crushing weight of injustice But Bobby has an ace up his sleeve Now he just has to stay alive long enough to play itThe movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg was based on this book The book was better than the movie and ended differently    "},

books I have read What began as an intriguing actionfilled series staring Sean Dillon has deteriorated into little more than a tale of tedious plotting endless talking and almost constant drinking among characters who have lost their individuality I wonder how the special unit headed by Ferguson can get anything right with all they drinking they do I also wonder how Shamrock the Irishborn villain can plot anything with his constant drinking Maybe its the Irish way according to Higgins if so it doesnt paint a very positive portrait of a warm and loving peopleThis is one is a disappointment mostly because the characters keep behaving in unrealistic ways without motivations that make any sense and because theres lots of crossover and confusion about whos who among the supposed good guysThe behavior is the worst part Supposedly very experienced spies reformed terrorists and special forces types blab about secret stuff tell people things they shouldnt and generally mouth off in such a way that the other side inevitably hears about it Then they discover theyve been discovered and walk blithely into danger anyway which no sensible person who has seen action would do and manage to overcome all odds to triumph over incredibly inept opposition This happens repeatedly and strains the readers willing suspension of disbeliefThe locations are meant to be glamourous but wind up being twodimensional cardboard backdrops and inserted not for any particularly believable reason but because action books clearly need to take place in glamourous locationsThe author relies on three recurring plot devices people whose business is guarding secrets discuss secrets in places where they are easily overheard people whose business is guarding secrets discuss secrets with people they ought not to trust secrets are divulged on deathbedsThere is no sense of urgency in what happens in the story We learn that a dying soldier had accidentally recorded an Irishspeaking commander of a Taliban unit in Afghanistan that had attacked and killed a dozen US Army Rangers and members of a British medical team in an ambush The chase is on of course to find that apparent traitor who calls himself Shamrock We also hear of a mysterious Preacher the Al Qaeda leader in London who somehow manages to remain safe as an academic despite his constantly using a cell phone to contact those he controls including Shamrock surely MI should have intercepted his calls especially with key word recognition programs Along the way we hear a lot about the Troubles and their aftermath in Ireland yet see little of the consequences of that often brutal and tragic period in Irish history We also hear about the fighting in Afghanistan but most of the action is off stage all we get is a lot of talking about it What was promoted as a revenge novel in which I imagined Sean Dillon would go off to Afghanistan and find and destroy Shamrockor bring him back to the U K for trialbecame a big disappointmentAnother major issue I have with the novel is the lack of character development through individual portraits I had to read the first two hundred pages twice to get any sense of each character They sound alike use similar phrasing and are little more than cardboard cutouts including the villain Shamrock as well as secondary characters Higgins introduces The principals such as Sean Dillon General Ferguson Daniel Holley and Harry Millerwho should stand out as being sharply etched imagessound alike with my eyes closed I could not tell them apart Even Harry and Billy Salter have lost their individuality as street thugs and are now little more than shallow images of themselves Indeed Billy used to be quicktempered muscle for Harry in this book he plays a minor role In fact he is even taken out of a critical mission at the end in the Khufra Marshes of Algeria by Ferguson Higgins after Billy was shot at near pointblankrange in the chest while saved by a chest protector he was deemed too weak to go after ShamrockWhat little action is there occurs sporadically and doesnt feel or sound believable We have an amazing shot by Dillon at dawn in a pouring rain offbalance and at some distance in misty marshes as he wounds Shamrock but even that is contrived We also have an attack on Ferguson in Pakistan which is also artificial That attack raises the question of why Ferguson would even go on such a mission he must be in his s by now and retired When he does appear Ferguson plays a minor role in what happens Even Roper the highly skilled communications expert and researcher employed by Ferguson is just another name we know nothing about how or why he is in the chair and how he manages to thrive on a few hours of sleep I also wonder how he manages to do his critical work with all the alcohol he drinks Many of the character details were introduced in previous books the reader who is new to Higgins needs some of the background details otherwise he will be completely lost in this novelHiggins also seems to have a problem with women He killed off Hannah Bernstein an effective member of Fergusons unit in an earlier novel Dillons lady friend Monica Starling is mentioned but only in passing being shipped off by Higgins to Harvard and Shamrocks mother becomes an avenging angel It is as though Higgins doesnt know what to with his women so he figuratively get rids of them As a cheat Higgins opens the door to a sequel with Shamrocks mother predictably telling Dillon after her sons funeral service that she is going to avenge her sons death This is the same device Higgins used with Kate Rashid in early adventures with Sean Dillon We know what will happen to Shamrocks motherFinally Higgins irritatingly uses a variation of and he did when a characters asks to be told about an event in the story Rarely do two characters ever share information directly And of course to make a character sound Irish we have several Old sods or Old soulsThe edginess of a taut thriller is is gone in Judas Gate I have read all of Jack Higgins work from when he wrote as Harry Patterson through James Graham to today the Judas Gate is the biggest disappointment so far I think it is time for Higgins to retire Sean Dillon as he did with Liam Devlin and bring in new blood as the driving force in action thrillers not merely part of more intellectual exercises   What can I say about The Judas Gate Large stretches of boredom interrupted by moments of hmmm time to open my eyes now Dillon returns with a major new character Daniel Holley who seems to have no real reason for existing I usually enjoy Jack Higgins books for treadmill reading but this one was a few steps below his usual work I almost wondered if it was written by a ghostwriter or coauthor as has happened with too many of Tom Clancys book ideas but no it appears to have been written solely by Higgins Disappointing   Higgins remains at the top of his form in this latest saga of Sean Dillon General Ferguson and company as they ferret out the latest of their public enemies when they discover an Irishman is apparently aiding and abetting the enemy in Afghanistan With only a recording of the voice as a British team is all but destroyed Dillon and team set out to locate and eliminate this threat to their country But the enemy has nothing left to lose and attacks from the shadows of anonymity Twice various members of the team are sent into ambushes  who will come back alive When the attacks become personal who will remain unscathed When the man is brought before them facetoface who will recognize him for who and what he really isThis is the seventythird title published by Higgins the eighteenth in the Dillon series Like most of his books this is military intrigue and is also somehow connected to the IrishEnglish problem that has reigned in those islands for centuries Mr Patterson Im a fan   The Judas Gate is right at the top of the list of the worst books Jack Higgins has ever writtenThe characters have lost all individuality the action somehow manages to be dull the plot developments are predictable and the settings in the book are all recycled from prior books asides for the brief introduction of a few scenes in PakistanAfghanistan Thats without going into the clichd writing recycled sequences  including the rehashed shot in the chest appear dead but oh no hes wearing a bulletproof vest or scene variety number two shot in the chest collapse then retaliate and kill the shooterIve read all  books before this one in the Sean Dillon series and can say without a doubt that the quality and plot development has been on a downward spiral for sometime and I shant be bothering to buy number If you are interested in his work check out The Eagle Has Landed The Eagle Has Flown  Sheba for decent novels   The Judas Gate well in my opinion it was a pretty good read There were some thrilling scenes throughout this book but a lot of it was just bad dialogue Shamrocks character could have been written much better than it was Jack Higgins surprisingly disappointed me with this book honestly if I hadnt had to complete it for a summer assignment I would have stopped dead center in the book Over all Sean Dillon came out as the star in the book helping get rid of the Muslim British terrorists that were constantly being recruited to help kill proud soldiers sadly In my opinion if you want to read this book go for it but dont have that high of hopes for it like you should with all of the other Jack Higgons books this drags on a lot and doesnt have a well thought out climactic moment which honestly just makes this book a bore   "},

"text": "According to   So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing Atlantis is rising frogs are falling tempers are flaring Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fastliving demonboth of whom have lived amongst Earths mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyleare not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture  And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist    Remember back when funny books were funny Back before you went to college and found out that Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen werent funny after all but Samuel Beckett and Charles Dickens were hilarious Remember when the words on the page didnt just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity but actually made you laugh out loud Well thats the kind of humor that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimans  release Good Omens brims with and it is so damn goodThe two British authors were both relatively unknown at the time of their partnership having met when Gaiman working as a journalist at the time interviewed Pratchett on the success of his first major novel The Colour of Magic The two became quick friends and proceeded to write the  pages of the now cult classic novel by sending floppy disks through the mail and calling each other on the phone Of course that story is all explained in the appendix provided you dont pick up an original printing of the book if you do do that however you can probably sell it for quite a bit of change so dont be discouraged by your lack of author interviewsBut the real story at hand is of course the narrative of Good Omens itselfthe tale of two friends a demon named Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale who have spent all of human existence on earth and have rather come to like it so when it comes time for the Apocalypse they try to do whatever is in their powers to stop it The cast of costars can only described as vast with some characters only popping in long enough for Aziraphale to take over their body or to go on a shooting rampage The main other characters though include the Antichrist himself a young boy named Adam and his gang of friends a witchfinder named Newton Pulsifer and his love interest Anathema Device who just happens to be a witch and one whose ancestor Agnes Nutter was burned at the stake by Newtons greatgreatetc grandfather ThouShaltNotCommitAdultery PulsiferPerhaps youre beginning to pick up on that sense of humor I mentionedThats what makes this book so great Im sort of a sucker for religious humor and religious horror movies and Ive read a lot of books about the End Days This one has to rank near the top maybe even as the downright finest Its humor ranges from simple little comedic bits to social commentary on religion and the human racebut no matter how big or small the joke is every one of them is attended to equally and they are all funny because of that Though some of the British jokes and references flew by me a problem the authors usually account for in their humorous footnotes I really did enjoy this book all the way from the plot down to how it was written It really is an impressive feat for a coauthored book to feel so seemless this honestly almost puts shame to the excellent Stephen KingPeter Straub doubleups The Talisman and Black HouseSo let down your guard pack away that condescension that your professors poured into you Lit class after Lit class and resist the urge to turn up your nose at any novel you can buy in trade paperback form in airports for  but higher in Canadaoh wait not anymore I actually laughed out loud as I read Good Omens A few times to be completely honest And thats pretty impressive for a cynical jaded old bastard like me   I somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously So I couldnt help wonderingWhat Madam Bovary Might Have Thought Of Three days later a package arrived there was no return address but she immediately recognised Rodolphes hand It contained a paperback novel whose title was Good Omens Feverishly she cast herself over it Her English was poor but with the aid of a dictionary she persevered and soon made great progressThe more she read the greater her bewilderment became The book at first reminded her of Candide which she had surreptitiously read at the convent but M Voltaires sprit had been replaced by another ingredient she was unable to name she suspected that it must be the strange English invention they called humour All the personages were wellmeaning and agreeable the witches the torturers of witches the prostitutes even the Demons of Hell they were filled with kindness and compassion and their worst faults amounted to an occasional mild irritability Where were the indifference and thoughtless cruelty that surrounded her and which had now become the very air she breathed She did not know whether Rodolphe had sent her the book to comfort her or to mock her in her despair and her futile attempts to resolve this question gradually resulted in an agonising headache Her husband prescribed an infusion of valerian and persuaded her to retire for the night she lay sleepless in her bed a long time until the drug finally took effect just as the sky was beginning to lighten She dreamed of apocalyptic prophecies redheaded women wielding swords endless circles of horseless carriages young boys with dogsIn the morning she remembered that she should purchase some arsenicIt seemed unfair for this to be oneway So in the spirit of granting a right of reply heres What Good Omens Might Have Thought Of Madam BovaryI saw this smashin film yesterday on TV said Adam as the Them listened attentively It was called Madam BovverBoy She was a lady skinhead interrupted BrianNo stupid said Adam Its a French name BovverBoy By FlowBearYou mean Madame Bovary by Flaubert said Wensleydale I read about it in The Encyclopaedia of World LiteratureAdam gave him a withering glance Thats what I said he continued Madam BovverBoy by FlowBear Shes married to this doctor and hes dead borin so she starts hangin around with these two lovers and then she maxes out her credit card so she eats arsernick and poisons herself The bit where shes dyin of the arsernick is dead good Her tongues hanging out and shes screamin Why did she max out her credit card asked PepperShe was buying presents for her lovers said Adam Roses an boxes of chocolates an stuff like that I thought the lovers were supposed to give her presents said Brian dubiously My sisters boyfriend gave her this huge bunch of roses on Valentines Day and a box of Quality Street and a balloon with She gave them presents instead because it was a protofeminist novel explained Wensleydale authoritatively Thats what The Encyclopaedia of World Literature saysAdam felt that his control of the situation was slipping and decided to up the stakes Its all true he said in an exegetical move that would have had Flaubert scholars around the world clutching their foreheads Based on a true story he added prudently in case the The Encyclopaedia of World Literature happened to have opinions on the subject Behind the bushes Aziraphale raised an eyebrow Crowley looked defensive Very loosely based he whispered hastily I mean I tempted her its my job you know but Gustave changed the ending for dramatic purposes Said it didnt work to have Rodolphe sort out her debts and then settle down in a cozy mnage  quatre with her Lon and her husband I told him thats what actually happened but he insisted the arsenic worked better   In my personal hierarchy of books this one comes a close second after Bulgakovs The Master and Margarita What can I say  like diabolical father like infernal son In a way I can view this book as my own personal therapy session  that is in addition to it being a hilarious dryhumor take on Armageddon and the everdual nature of humanity its highs and lows and our ability to be both frequently almost at the same time As a kid I had a habit of getting into the books clearly not meant for my age  like for instance WARNING THERE WILL BE MILD SPOILERS BECAUSE I CANAs predicted by the titular th century witch Agnes Nutter in her extremely nice accurate book of prophecies handed down through centuries to her last living professional descendant Anathema Device Armageddon is quickly approaching The four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse have set out on their way and that must mean things are getting serious   And this upcoming major event is a source of some serious worry for eternalenemiesturnedreluctantfriends Aziraphale An angel and a parttime rare book dealer and Crowley An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards the duo who after six thousand years have gone native and would infinitely prefer this world to the future where either side wins  the future oh the horror without good music or bookshops or sushi restaurants And so the unlikely allies decide to band together to prevent the end of the world Except things do not go as plannedThe lovely images above can be seen here and hereYou see the young  Aptly named Adam he grows up  as his name suggests  perfectly human in a little corner of paradise  the English village of Lower Tadfield But Agnes Nutter is never wrong and as her prophesies suggest shortly after Adams eleventh birthday on which he DOES get a much wanted Hellhound Dog the events of the end of the world are set in their inevitable ineffable motion But Adams essential humanity puts a new spin on this old storyThe problem with the Antichrist Adam is that he a human elevenyearold boy is fueled  unexpectedly  by Love and righteous indignation He loves this world and he coming into his power wants a very human thing  he wants to make it better Dont we all But do and can his good intentions make any difference in the way things have been prophesied to goIf there is one thing this book gets through its the belief in humanity Not in its wickedness or goodness or anything like that Just humanity in all the multifaceted nature of it in its righteousness and wretchedness love and cruelty strengths and weaknesses stupidity and wisdom Sometimes maybe when left to our own devices when not preached to in one way or another we can perhaps develop into flawed but hopefully decent beings  like Adam named after the first human in the prophetic fashion after all Because what makes life interesting as a particular angel and demon would loudly attest to is precisely the combination of good and evil nice and nasty mean and kind that we all possess in the precarious and miraculous balance that is the true treasure of humanity Because it makes us act like peopleAnd maybe just maybe due to our alwaysbalancing nature on the borderline between two conflicting universes that we humans inhabit we will be able to eventually figure it out  without anyone messing with our heads filling them with the Good or the Evil endlessly preaching what they believe to be true  but simple letting us be ourselves Maybe we will figure things out on our ownThe brilliant PratchettGaiman duo provides everything these two authors are famous for  easy readability dry intelligent sarcasminfused humor seamless plot that pushes the limits of imagination while staying perfectly grounded in albeit fantastical reality and first and foremost very apt observations about human nature as well as in a true Pratchettlike way a complete irreverence for the setinstone beliefs and ideas At times its easy for those familiar with their respective styles to tell which one of them penned which part at times its impossible  but it doesnt matter as their writing styles blend together so well so seamlessly so seemingly effortlesslyThis is an excellent book  both funny and serious at times utterly unpredictable at times baffling at times logical Its a pleasure to read and a pleasure to seriously reflect upon after having a good laugh And for all of that it gets the ineffable five stars  June  I just listened to this one on audiobook  AGAIN I love it more and more with each time I do I have to advise  if you plan to listen to this one please get the British version with Stephen Briggs as the narrator Isis Publishing  it is lightyears better than Harper Audio Stephen Briggs is amazing   Overall this book was a huge disappointment for me Id heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years When I finally started it I was about  pages into it and thought Yes This is going to be one of the most entertaining books Ive ever read It was like reading The Hitchhikers Guide for the first time again It was witty and fastpaced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion And then about halfway through I realized that I just wasnt really laughing as much anymore The story seemed to get bogged down with characters that werent that interesting for me to read about and who I often found a bit annoying Most notably the yearold Antichrist and his friends seemed really out of place in the book They felt like they would have been at home in a Norman Rockwell painting or British equivalenta ragtag bunch of kids with slingshots and backyard adventures I think that I was supposed to find them and their inane conversations entertaining maybe even a little bit cute but every time they came around which felt like quite a bit I thought that the book just screeched to a haltMost of the other characters in the book were great fun to readthe demon and the angel and their strange sort of friendship was easily the best part of the book for me The four horsemen of the apocalypse were also a lot of fun at least most of the time Overall the premise was brilliant What a disappointment for me that it just couldnt keep it together throughout The ending seemed contrived and the resolution was just unsatisfying for me I know that so many people loved this book I wish that I could have enjoyed it as much as they did    This has got to be one of the funniest satires Ive ever read I suppose the closest comparison I could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to Dogma but filtered through a distinctly British lense That description doesnt really do the story justice but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book The whole premise and Im not giving much away here begins with the accidental misplacement of the infant Antichrist during a complex babyswapping procedure intended to kick off the Apocalypse Its all down hill from there  This book is funny irreverent and at times surprisingly insightful While some parts of the book may seem cliched or even kitschy the book never puts up the pretense of being revolutionary or edgy The characters like any melodrama are intended to be archetypal so even the relatively predictable changes that occur seem appropriate in the context of the story The surprises are really in the details and in that regard the execution is brilliant To give you an example the devil Crowly drives a car in which the tapedeck will transform any tape placed in it into a copy of Queens Greatest Hits within a very short period of time after one hits the play button Now I love Bohemian Rhapsody as much as the next guy but an eternity of nothing but THAT particular album Thats the kind of devilry that works on many levels   "},

"author": "David George Haskell",
"text": "A biologist reveals the secret world hidden in a single square meter of forest In this wholly original book biologist David Haskell uses a onesquaremeter patch of oldgrowth Tennessee forest as a window onto the entire natural world Visiting it almost daily for one year to trace natures path through the seasons he brings the forest and its inhabitants to vivid lifeEach of this books short chapters begins with a simple observation a salamander scuttling across the leaf litter the first blossom of spring wildflowers From these Haskell spins a brilliant web of biology and ecology explaining the science that binds together the tiniest microbes and the largest mammals and describing the ecosystems that have cycled for thousands  sometimes millions  of years Each visit to the forest presents a nature story in miniature as Haskell elegantly teases out the intricate relationships that order the creatures and plants that call it homeWritten with remarkable grace and empathy The Forest Unseen is a grand tour of nature in all its profundity Haskell is a perfect guide into the world that exists beneath our feet and beyond our backyards Letter I wrote to the authorIve just finished reading The Forest Unseen I have slowly savored your book over many weeks reading one days entry at most two at one sitting I have never read anyone who combined a meditative consciousness with a scientists mind so beautifully You presented the theme of the interconnectedness of all things so delightfully in so many amazing forms birds eggs vultures lichen and the roothairfungus relationship all come easily to mind as examplesLong ago I learned to walk in the woods without a goal I live in western North Carolina and for many years lived on a gravel road surrounded by national forests I carved my own hiking trails to special placesa rock outcropping a particular tree a springhead flowing over a small rock cliffand would walk to those places and then sit and observeNow I live in Asheville in a mountain cove with a lawn that is mostly Prunella vulgaris Four or five afternoons a week I work at home I spend time in a little patch of this lawn with my cat sitting and observing the ants spiders and other creatures crawling over the vegetation Youve inspired me to see this suburban patch as my own mandala and look even close than beforeYouve created a book that I know I will enjoy reading many times in my life I already plan on having my husband read this aloud to me so we can savor it together   The premise of this most excellent natural history of a forest is that the author stakes out a small circle in the woods say about  feet across in a tiny tiny but one of the only left sigh old growth forest remnant in eastern tennessee He goes out everyday for a year and just sits there observing the plants and animals Of course that is a bit of a simplification as he discussed things like the lifecycle of salamanders and butterflies and migrating tufted titmice and deer and hickory trees etc etc so one would not actually see much of what he describes but he does a good job balancing the scientific with the folksy and the philosophical and the unknown Because frankly we dont really know a whole hell of a lot about the ecosystems we live in and many of these are disappearing as we pave for strip malls and kill for golf courses etc the text is not mucked up with footnotes or too much high science but there is a very nice contextual bibliography if reader is interested in more hardcore reading But this is a good example of nat hist porn yummy yummyHere is a small excerpt from chapter entitled December rdLitterI lie facedown at the edge of the mandala the circle he has been observing all year and really is my only gripe in the book I hate that word bigot readying myself for a dive under the surface of the leaf litter The red oak leaf below my nose is crisp protected from fungi and bacteria by the drying sun and wind Like the other leaves on the litters surface this oak leaf will remain intact for nearly a year finally crumbling in the next summers rains These surface leaves form a crust that both hides and makes possible the drama below Protected under the shield of superficial leaves the rest of autumns castoffs are pulverized in the wet dark world of the litter Yearly the ground heaves like a breathing belly swelling in a rapid inhalation in October then sinking as the life force is suffused into the forests bodyBelow the red oak leaf other leaves are moist and matted I tease away a wet sandwich of three maple and hickory leaves Waves of odor roll out of the opening first the sharp musty smell of decomposition and then the rounded pleasant odor of fresh mushrooms The smells are edged with a richer earthy background the mark of healthy soil These sensations are the closet I can come to seeing the microbial community in the soil The light receptors and lenses in my eyes are too large to resolve the photons bouncing off bacteria protozoa and many fungi but my nose can detect molecules that waft out of the microscopic world giving me a peek through my blindnessA peek is about all that anyone is given Of the billion microbes that live in the half handful of soil that I have exposed only one percent can be cultivated and studied in the lab The interdependencies among the other ninetynine percent are so tight and our ignorance about how to mimic or replicate these bonds is so deep that the microbes die if isolated from the whole The soils microbial community is therefore a grand mystery with most of its inhabitants living unnamed and unknown to humanityAs we chisel away at the edges of this mystery jewels fall out of the eroding block of ignoranceThe forest unseen a years watch in nature by David HaskellA very well written natural history of old growth hardwood forest Naturalist Haskell observes one small patch in the forest for a year and describes the life and rhythms of reptiles flowers trees birds microorganisms insects mammals fungi and the history of the forest in the USA how it has changed and how it has stayed wild Written for all audiences this is very informative and entertaining poetical even The book has a very nice bibliography but unfortunately no maps or pictures   Well Im clearly in the vast minority here but Im just not enjoying this book enough to push through and finish it There have been a couple of chapters that Ive found pretty interesting but theyve been few and far between and at times Ive found myself feeling pretty skeptical about what hes describing for instance the entire chapter where he decides to take all of his clothes off in the middle of winter to see what animals feel in the cold and it somehow doesnt occur to him until the very end of the chapter that duh most of the animals that live in the woods have fur and feathers that help keep them warm in addition to other bodily processes we dont have That made him seem either kind of stupid or like he thinks Im kind of stupid Either way it annoyed me I dont know maybe Im being a jerk about this but I really like the idea of this book and was hoping it would focus a little more on the science side of nature and a little less on thepoetry side Or something Anyway its just not working for me    I should have loved The Forest Unseen Forests delight me and Ive also spent time sitting in them and simply watching There are many thoughts and opinions that Haskell and I share Unfortunately this book just bored me Maybe its my own fault because I tried to read it through like I would any novel instead of savoring it bitebybite as other readers did But I think there may be a legitimate reason The writingIt was sloppy Poetic but sloppy And the poetic descriptions werent even that good Oftentimes Haskells decision to opt for a metaphor or some elaborate description left me confused When he simply discussed the forest and its occupants I liked the book well enough The chapter about turkey vultures for example was particularly fascinating Did you know turkey vulture guts can kill anthrax But too often it was simply comically overwritten Dont believe me Lets look at the chapter for March th accompanied by my thoughts as I read itThe mandala is a molluskan Serengeti Herds of coiled grazers move across the open savanna of lichens and mossUh whats happening Coiled mollusks Maybe hes talking about miniature forest shrimps or something glances at chapter title which yes it was my fault for missing  Snails Oh snails Alright Snails move in herds Thats new to me And theyre not coiled are they I mean their SHELLS are coiled but their bodies arent Unless Im confused Help I didnt know I was so misinformed about snails Or maybe he just means Many snails crawl across the mandate Well go with that for nowThe largest snails travel alone plying the crazy angled surfaces of the leaf litter leaving the mossy hillsides for the nimble youngstersSo  only baby snails travel in herds And adult snails prefer leaf litter to moss Why Tell me moreI lie down on my belly and creep up on a large snail that sits at the edge of the mandala I lift the hand lens to my eye and shuffle closerDont get distracted Haskell Baby snails travel in herds Im not done with that yetThrough the lens the snails head fills my field of vision  a magnificent sculpture of black glass Patches of silver decorate the shining skin and small grooves run across and down the animals backSowere not talking about snails herdlike behavior anymore They DONT move in herdsMy movements cause mild alarm the snail withdraws its tentacles and hunches back into the shell I hold my breath and the snail relaxes Two small whiskers poke their way out of the chin waving in the air before reaching down and touching the rock These rubbery feelers move like fingers reading Braille touching lightly skimming meaning from the sandstone scriptAre these tentacles and whiskers the same things or different Nice Braille simile thoughSeveral minutes later a second pair of tentacles launches out from the crown of the snails headBack to tentacles again So tentacles and whiskers are the same Got itThey reach upward each with a milky eye at its tip and wave at the tree canopy aboveYou know if this second pair of tentacles or whiskers are the eye stalks I still dont know what the first pair was for Maybe he really did mean whiskers My own eye bulges at the snail through the lens but this monstrous globe seems to be of little concern to the snail which extends its eyestalks farther These fleshy flagpoles now reach wider than the shell and swing wildly from side to sideFleshy flagpoles Yes we all learned about alliteration in high school But even alliterative this metaphor is still silly INSERT SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS DISCUSSING SNAIL SIGHT WHICH WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEYRE INTERESTING AND IM ENGROSSED FORGETTING THE ORIGINAL SNAIL THEN IT COMESWait WHAT The snails head EXPLODED How Why Is this like how slugs are supposed to melt when you pour salt on them And what was this snail doing anyway I forget goes back several paragraphs So the snail was crawling then it went in its shell It came back out waved its eyes around and now its head exploded CrazyThe black dome is split by a knot of cloudy flesh The knot pushes out forward then the snail turns to face meI thought the snails head exploded It doesnt have a face anymoreThe tentacles form an X radiating away from the bubbling doughy protrusion at the centerIm really not following Is the doughy protrusion the same as the fleshy knot Why is it bubbling Are these explosion remnants Center of WHATTwo glassy lips push out defining a vertical slit and the whole apparatus heaves downward pressing the lips to the groundgiggles at yonic imagery But Im not proud of itI watch saucereyed as the snail starts to glide over the rock levitating across a sea of lichen Tiny beating hairs and ripples of infinitesimally small muscles propel the ebony grazer on its pathAlright now Im just getting irritated by your inconsistent and mixed metaphors First the mandala was a savanna now its a sea But the snail is still a grazer Shouldnt it be a swooping seabird sarcasm Whatever Cant you just tell me why young snails move in herds and why this snail explodedFrom my prone position I see the snail pause amid lichen flakes and black fungus spiking from the surface of oak leaves I peek over the lens and suddenly it is all gone The change of scale is a wrench into a different world the fungus is invisible the snail is a valueless detail in a world dominated by bigger things looks at book suspiciously Waithas all this head exploding stuff been what I think I suspect it might have Oh cmonMy snail vigil ends when the sun breaks out from behind a cloud The mornings soft humidity has lifted and the snail heads toward El Capitan or a smallish rock depending on how you see the worldWell to hell with this You mean all that exploding head bubbling flesh description was really just describing how the snail moves I  I just cant WHY CANT YOU JUST SAY THAT THE SNAIL CRAWLED ACROSS LICHEN And yeah I get it you exaggerated for effect to demonstrate how dramatic smallscale actions can appear when magnified But I still have no idea what happened What was the snails head actually doing that it looked like it exploded What was the fleshy knob that came out of a black dome Was the dome the head or the shell How is the snail moving CANT YOU JUST TELL ME ABOUT SNAILSAnd that was this book for me a constant struggle to decipher meaning amid a barrage of misguided tedious metaphor It choked what otherwise could have been a delightful narrative Too bad   This book made me mad Not because it wasnt extremely good  it was  its because I wanted to write this book at least I did in my s That said Im sure I would never had done it as well as David George Haskell hasThe concept of the book is simple Haskell takes a very small area I believe a square meter in the mountains of Tennessee and watches it very closely through a full calendar year with the eye of a highly trained biologist and ecologist then tells us what he sees The result is a few dozen short essays on a particular aspect notable during whatever season hes writing in and follows it through with exceptionally well explained and not always a given in nature writing  cough cough Bill Bryson scientifically accurate illustrations of the remarkable world taking place within above and around that square meter of forestThe concept is not particularly new Aldo Leopold may not have invented it but surely perfected it with his classic A Sand County Almanac What Haskell leaves behind in Leopolds easy narrative tone he makes up for in his ecological precision and insight Even the places where a cliche is expected and to some degree it usually arrives Haskell is on top of his game enough to make even the cliched metaphors and extrapolations to the broader world both fresher and more nuanced than one would get from a lesser observerNotably Haskell takes a very dangerous step past the pure science of his observations and his recordings of his subjective experience into the spiritual and the poetic calling his square meter of observation a mandala after the Buddhist meditative sand paintings Yes I rolled my eyes at its first usage and yes Haskell at points carries his metaphors just a halfstep too far but it is truly surprising that the excess is never more than that halfstep And in a way this is perhaps the most honest form of nature writing possible in the Tennessee mountains Anyone familiar with the forests of the southern Appalachians can attest to the ability of their intensity their rugged beauty and at times their harshness to bring out a bit of the poet in even the most hardened skeptic Whereas the average nature writer often falls prey to one of the twin temptations of either presenting the concepts from a safely rationalized distance or of galumphing into excessive poetic outbursts Haskell presents his thoughts and experiences with appropriate modesty and candor For instance in the late fall as the leafless canopy lets in the most light in months he tells us that the lift on his spirits takes him by surprise and then goes on to talk about the human need for light very briefly but then turns directly to the groundtied herbaceous species taking advantageA passage near the end illustrates the balance Haskell achieves Scientific models and metaphors of machines are helpful but too limited They cannot tell us all that we need to know What lies beyond the theories we impose on nature This year I have tried to put down scientific tools and to listen to come to nature without a hypothesis without a scheme for data extraction without a lesson plan to convey answers to students without machines and probes I have glimpsed how rich science is but simultaneously how limited the scope and in spirit It is unfortunate that the practice of listening generally has no place in the formal training of students In this absence science needlessly fails We are poorer for this and possibly more hurtfulAnd there in exactly the space where lesser writers would have either extolled the great virtues of scientific knowledge or railed against the cold equations of mathematical ecology Haskell rightfully lifts up the in his case rather considerable scientific insights that can illuminate his mandala but doesnt shirk its shortcomings A simple concept Clearly not terribly novel since I was trying to do it a dozen some odd years ago and tried many times by students of ecology and of Leopold However in Haskells hands we get something far more worthy of celebration  a work that I have no hesitation in calling a new classic of American nature writing   "},

"text": "The atomic bomb was not the only project to occupy government scientists during the s Antigravity technology originally spearheaded by scientists in Nazi Germany was another high priority one that still may be in effect today Now for the first time an acclaimed journalist with unprecedented access to key sources in the intelligence and military communities reveals suppressed evidence that tells the story of a quest for a discovery that could prove as powerful as the atomic bombThe Hunt for Zero Point explores the scientific speculation that zero point energya limitless source of potential power that may hold the key to defying and thereby controlling gravityexists in the universe and can be replicated The pressure to be the first nation to harness gravity is immense as it means having the ability to build military planes of unlimited speed and range along with the most deadly weaponry the world has ever seen The ideal shape for a gravitydefying vehicle happens to be a perfect disk making antigravity tests a possible explanation for numerous UFO sightings during the past fifty yearsDrawn from interviews with those involved int the research and visits to labs in Europe and the United States The Hunt for Zero Point is a captivating account of the twentieth centurys most puzzling unexplained phenomenon Good read Try great read This is another page turner Nick Cooks indefatigable search for buried science after WWII would read like a spy thriller if you didnt know he used to be a top editor at Janes Defense Weekly He is highly credible and I can vouch for that professionally which some reviewers have questioned No wonder given the subject matter Bottom line This is a guy who doesnt make stuff up Anyway you couldnt make this stuff up if you tried

research is so well documented the facts are so solid Amy Gerber and I referred to it constantly during the making of our Cold War documentary MY GRANDFATHER WAS A NAZI SCIENTIST Opa von Braun and Operation Paperclip Ive had The Hunt for Zero Point on my top shelf ever since   Amazing read i was expecting a little kookiness but this book had none of that There is most definatily a hidden technology breakthrough and failure to disclose it is keeping the whole of humanity from a paradigm shift The fall of gravity like the fall of reilgion has the potential to set mankind free of its socialpolitical chainsAlso discussed heavily in this book is the German militaryindustrial complex and how the SS started controlling arms  tech development the way they structured their top secret security and how America and it aerospace industry adopted the same techniques to keep black projects under wraps I had known how much we had walked away with from Germany tech wise like Vs and such but I was stunned to learn the details of such an operation as it was enacted The book could use some flow charts and other visual data organization showing overlaps in developments and a general timeliine better maps also This can only serve to help more see the undeniable connections made in pursuit of this technologyThe upcoming film Iron Sky picks up where Kammler left off in Germany or more appropriately vanished turning the storyline into more of a comic book adventure Should be a good film but should not be allowed to distract the populace from the real truth behind the tale Kammler so freaking mysterious enigmatic might be one of the most important figures of last century with only a few knowing his nameMore books like this one are needed to show the world what is really going on It is so often rumored that the Nazi and SS were into occult projects Its easy to see how labs in hidden mountain caves emitting strange glows with levitating objects  mysterious effects could easily have been distorted    If there is a book to give a newcomer to the subjects of antigravity technology and secret science then this would have to be the one Its a very well written account of one mans search for information and the truth about these fascinating ideas The author is a reputable aviation journalist in his own right which means the book is well researched and presented His search takes him from the present day back to those secretive events surrounding the snatching of German scientists and technologies immediately after the German surrender in World War Two and tries to connect the dots within the postwar US and Soviet military industrial complexes to unravel the secrets of antigravity machine development and other associated technologies I found the stories from the world of Nazi science totally engrossing with so many intriguing ideas and personalities all driven by various motivations I get the impression that we may be just beginning to discover the wonders from this dark time in Germanys history and if one can look past the fanaticism of the Nazi regime and in particular Himmlers occultdriven SS who ended up controlling most of the technology you can see so much evidence of scientific and technical brilliance A topnotch book and the best overview of this amazing topic that Ive read so far I highly recommend it   This book was quite a surprise as it is written in the style of a story I would classify it as a sort of military detective story that is both thoroughly engrossing and entertaining I would thoroughly recommend it for any fans of conspiracy theory in particular those who are interested in antigravity drives The suggestion is that the technology is available now but suppressed or in use only in deep black projects I particularly liked the fact that according to Bill Gunston OBE the stealth bomber does not have enough thrust or lift from its engine spec to lift its  pound weight of the ground It uses anti gravity technology to reduce its weight intriguing indeed especially coming from someone so respected in the industry as here is the technology apparently in plain sight Great book well worth the

"author": "Molly Guptill Manning",
"text": "When America entered World War II in  we faced an enemy that had banned and burned over  million books and caused fearful citizens to hide or destroy many more Outraged librarians launched a campaign to send free books to American troops andgathered  million hardcover donations In  the War Department and the publishing industry stepped in with an extraordinary program million small lightweight paperbacks for troops to carry in their pockets and their rucksacks in every theater of war  Comprising  different titles of every imaginable type these paperbacks were beloved by the troops and are still fondly remembered today Soldiers read them while waiting to land at Normandy in hellish trenches in the midst of battles in the Pacific in field hospitals and on long bombing flightsThey wrote to the authors many of whom responded to every letterThey helped rescue The Great Gatsby from obscurityThey made Betty Smith author of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn into a national icon When Books Went to War is an inspiring story for history buffs and book lovers alike This was the most bookish book Ive ever seen on World War II And because of its extreme bookishness it also managed to be the most heartwarming nonfiction book about that war Ive read There just arent a lot of heartwarming books about Nazis Not sure whyAnyway the author set out to chronicle how books helped American soldiers serving overseas Librarians organized massive donations of books to send to soldiers but eventually the Armed Services started printing their own editions of lightweight paperbacks ASEs which were read often and frequently shared According to the author one of the most popular books was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith which I read when I was a kid and am now excited to rereadI listened to this on audio and it was one inspiring story after another about how books helped the soldiers Sure there were upsetting references to the Nazis burning books but overall this was a highly enjoyable story of the power of the written word Preach on sisterFavorite QuotesIf it had not been for the mountains of books that were sent to the training camps and overseas units during the war many men may never have developed an interest in reading studying or returning to school Librarians felt dutybound to try to stop Hitler from succeeding in his war of ideas against the United States They had no intention of purging their shelves or watching their books burn and they were not going to wait until war was declared to take actionThey werent just for entrainment and diversion Books also served as the premier weapon in fighting Adolf Hitlers war of ideas Nazi Germany sought control over peoples beliefs not just their bodies and territory From the  statesanctioned book burnings in Germany to the purging of libraries across Europe as nations were conquered by the Nazis unGerman reading material was threatened with extinction The scale of destruction was impressive By VE Day it is estimated that Germany had destroyed over  million books in Europe It is no exaggeration to say that the ASEs helped create an entire new cohort of readers The flip side of a new universe of readers however is that almost everyone thinks he can be a writer Ironically council publishers were soon besieged with book proposals as countless men expressed a desire to publish their war storiesUnder Roosevelts plan higher education would be doled out irrespective of social class or wealth for the first time in American history This democratization of education for veterans was a fitting conclusion to a war fought in the name of democracy and freedom    In a slice of history thats hard to imagine could be repeated today When Books Went to War tells the story of a program that delivered millions of books to Americans in the military overseas during World War II For some reason this story has been all over place recently in an article in Atlantic magazine in a book about The Great Gatsby by Maureen Corrigan So We Read On and now here It was no secret but I never heard of the program until a few months agoIts a fascinating history and Molly Guptill Manning does it justice The book is short under two hundred pages but it covers a lot of territory It touches on the effects the books themselves had on the troops as well as the boost to the popularity of paperbacks during and after the war By providing over a thousand titles to those at war a generation of readers was created and many went on to go to college through the GI Bill while others simply kept the habit of reading for pleasureIn addition to the wartime program of providing small cheap paperbacks to the military another program after the war provided translations of American works to civilians in countries where few books had been published since before the war This was a huge opportunity for American propaganda and influence which Manning glosses over but is dealt with in more detail in John Henchs Books as WeaponsWhen Books Went to War is the best kind of history book  wellresearched informative and hard to put down   More books were given to the American armed services than Hitler destroyed That just about sums up the goals of the American government in creating and publishing the ASE Armed Services Editions for distribution to American servicemen in WWII Remembered fondly by veterans it provided free small easily transportable paperback books for servicemen to fit in their pockets to be read whenever they needed the escape books provided For book lovers this is an informative account of how reading literally saved the sanity of hundreds of thousands of soldiers during the war    I vividly remember the American Service Edition of W H Hudsons Green Mansions that was among my parents books with its distinctive shapethe width about double in size from the height its double columns of type and its floppy cover I suspect that my father brought this book back from his Army service in World War II A draftee from the Chicago slums he exemplified the person for whom these books were distributed by the US Army and Navy Thrown together with draftees from places as remote as rural Georgia and officers from Nashvilles upper classes and sent to North Africa Sicily Germany and the Netherlands he found his war experiences terrifying boring and fascinating Always a reader his access to the surprisingly wide variety of newlycreated paperbacks supplied by American librarians publishers and government officials must have stimulated and comforted him as it appears to have done for many other soldiers After five years of military service my father returned home and took advantage of the GI Bill to go to college and earn a PhD in American Literature Though he was married and working at the same time he found going to school with other veterans who were as serious about learning as he was one of the most exciting periods of his life His rise to middleclass status and his later career as a professor novelist and author of several scholarly books was directly linked to his military service particularly to the GI Bill and possibly even to the ASE paperbooks with which he had been supplied This book is a paean to the farsighted and broadminded librarians publishers and government officials who wanted to supply soldiers with a solitary form of comfort and distraction on the battlefield regardless of how remote that battlefield might be In an era when conscription drew fairly democratically from all social classes in the US the reading material given to the soldiers was similarly broad in scope and point of view The GI Bill capitalized on those democratic impulses and made it possible for many people who could never before have afforded to go to college to join the middle class Like so many other aspects of American democracy this one seems very remote from todays world    As a professed bibliophile I was intrigued when I learned of the publication of When Books Went to War by Molly Guptill Manning The concept of the book was fascinating and it seemed to me that the topic the impact of reading on American military personnel during World War II has never been given much attention Now with Mannings monograph we have a short history of the role of books during the Second World War ranging from Nazi book burnings the ideological war between Nazism and Democracy the diversion provided to American soldiers that allowed them to endure and the impact on the publishing industry that led to the production of the mass market paperback Manning has written a wonderful book as she integrates her theme in relation to the important events that took place during the warAccording to Manning there was no escape from the fear of dying during World War II Whether on land sea or in the air American GIs faced the likelihood that they or someone very close to them would not survive Any diversion from the anxiety that soldiers faced on an everyday basis was welcomed As Manning describes it the days were grinding the stress was suffocating and the dreams of home were often fleeting Any distraction from the horrors of war was cherished The men treasured mementos from home Letters from loved ones were rare prizes Card games puzzles music and the occasional sports game helped pass the hours waiting for action or sleep to come Yet mail could be frustratingly irregularsometimes taking as long as four or five months to arriveand games and the energy to play them could not always be mustered after a long day of training or fighting To keep morale from sinking there needed to be readily available entertainment to provide some relief from war xiiixiv The answer that evolved was the creation of book editions designed for soldiers portable and accessible for those in combat rehabilitation or other wartime situationsManning begins her narrative with a Nazi book burning rally on May   The purpose of the rally organized by Adolf Hitlers Minister of Public Enlightenment Joseph Goebbles was to ensure the purity of German literature and rid Germany of ideas antagonistic to German progress  The works of Sigmund Freud Emile Ludwig Thomas Mann Erich Maria Remarque among many others were tossed into the fire no longer available to German students Thousands of book burnings took place nationwide including major universities It is estimated that the Nazis burned over  million books during their reign of terror This set the stage for an aspect of the war that was apart from the battlefield as Hitler fought to eliminate democracy and free thought The American Library Association ALA described Nazi actions against intellectual freedom as a bibliocaust their weapon of choice was to encourage Americans to read and once the United States became an active belligerent supply books to American soldiersManning reviews the history of how America organized the distribution of books to American soldiers Beginning with conscription and the military training that followed the ALA and other organizations were created to gather and distribute books to American GIs At first the effort was based on collecting donations from the public at large but when that was deemed inadequate because of the increasing number of men in the military the fact that hardcover books which had been the staple of the American publishing industry before the war were much too heavy to be taken into combat also the supply of books was being exhausted and finally many books that were donated did not meet the needs of the troops The Victory Book Campaign VBC which had been in charge of book donations turned to the American publishing industry to solve the problem as one company Pocket Books had already begun publishing paperbacks The magazine industry had developed miniature editions for servicemen and they were very successful so why not the book industryThe key for infantry soldiers and those near the front was to travel as light as possible and at the same time meet the needs of soldiers who craved reading to make the noncombat time go quickly Manning provides details how the paperback volume evolved and how it caused a revolution in American publishing Publishers joined together to create the Armed Services Edition ASEs of hundreds of titles under the auspices of the Council of Books in Wartime Problems did develop in the production and distribution of these volumes but once these problems were solved millions of books came off the presses and were distributed overseas and to military facilities at home One of the more interesting insights that Manning provides centers on unpopular books before the war that would emerge as best sellers later on F Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby and Betty Smiths A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are cases in point The impact of these books on soldiers was profound Manning includes numerous letters written by GIs during the war extolling the virtues of the books they read and the need they filled GIs were interviewed after the war and expressed similar feelingsAs men waited on Landing Craft in the English Channel for the D Day landing many turned to books AJ Liebling a war correspondent for New Yorker magazine wrote that one infantry man told him these little books are a great thing They take you away  Many soldiers developed a relationship with the authors they read Katherine Anne Porters Short Stories touched the hearts of many soldiers and she received over  letters Betty Smith the author of A Tree grows in Brooklyn received  letters a year and answered each one As one private wrote Books are often the sole means of escape for GIsI havent seen many a man who never before had the patience or inclination to read a book pick up one of the Councils and become absorbed and ask for more  In fact many soldiers would become lifelong readers because of their experiences during the war Manning deftly captures the emotions that soldiers felt as they identified with the literature they read It brought them home and gave them hope for the future and helped them deal with the present Manning must have scoured many sources to come up with the letters she integrates into the narrative and it provides tremendous insight for the reader into the minds of the soldiers who fought The program to supply books did provoke some controversy particularly as the  Presidential election approached Senator Robert Taft amended the Soldier Voting Act which created a partisan battle over the ballots that soldiers would use Tafts amendment titled Article V stated no book could be sent to soldiers funded by government funds that containeded political argument or political propaganda of any kind designed or calculated to affect the result of any election  The Council responsible for choosing titles and the War Department afraid to run afoul of the legislation trimmed the approved list and books such as Charles Beards The Republic Catherine Drinker Bowens Yankee from Olympus and EB Whites One Mans Meat along textbooks for military education courses were no longer available The Council led the opposition arguing that books available in the United States now were not available overseas for American soldiers Manning characterizes the conflict as nothing more than a Republican attempt to hold down Roosevelts vote since  of GIs polled said they would vote for a fourth term Whether accurate or not Manning presents both sides of the argument as Republicans were forced to amend the legislation ostensibly overturning Article VOnce the war ended there was an obvious correlation between the success of the Council on Books in Wartime and postwar developments Under the GI Bill of Rights veterans were allowed a free college education Eventually  million veterans took advantage of this opportunity and many did so because of the reading habits they developed during the war For those who were not avid readers before the war the Victory Book Campaign was responsible for showing men they could thrive at book learning and studying after the war After all if they could read and learn burrowed in a foxhole between shell bursts surely they could handle a course of study in the classroom Further the American publishing industry continued publishing paperbacks revolutionizing the industry Numerous publishers began producing paperbacks and sales went from  million in  to  million in  and by  hardback sales were overtaken by those of paperbacks changes directly related to the ASEs of the war Molly Manning has examined a different aspect of World War II and its influence on post war America Her thoughtful approach and reasoned analysis has produced a wonderful story that needed to be told It is a reflection of American values and deserves to be read by a wide audience   "},

to a million page hits daily Every now and then Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning and we agreed that you should resolve it     He liked these questions so much that he started up What If If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide how long would you survive How dangerous is it really to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms how much power could we produce What if everyone only had one soulmateWhen if ever did the sun go down on the British empire  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and liveWhat would happen if the moon went awayIn pursuit of answers Munroe runs computer simulations pores over stacks of declassified military research memos solves differential equations and consults with nuclear reactor operators His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity studded with memorable cartoons and infographics They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind or at least a really big explosion Far more than a book for geeks WHAT IF Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read Ive been a reader of XKCD for ages Not just a reader a fan A big goey geeky fan So much of a fan that when I heard about this book I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner And yknow taunt people on the internet And it worked I got an early copy And I treasured it I petted it It was precious to me Precious Then life got in the way Conventions Promotion for my own book launch I had dad stuff to do I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser Then I had my book tour Through all of this I carried my precious ARC around waiting for the time when Id be able to spare the brainpower to read it I even took it on tour with me Honestly this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put togetherIt wasnt until I got back home that I started it I wanted something to read before I went to bed and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book Id be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule Despite my best intentions I read half the book that night It cost me precious sleep I couldnt afford to lose But I dont regret it Not a bit Its clever but if you know anything about Randall Munroe that wont come as a surprise to you And its funny and witty which are two different things by the way But again to readers of XKCD this wont come as any sort of surprise The surprise was how easy it was to read Theres some decent science in there but it wasnt anywhere nearly as braintaxing as Id expected Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply Thats a rare gift The other surprise is how much it pulled me in I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks Instead I tore through it Thats not usually the case for me with nonfiction books In brief its worth your time Even if you havent read his comic Even if you havent ever heard of Randall Munroe Even if youre not into science You should pick this up and read it Youll be glad you did    Q What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of A Actually less than youd thinkFirst a little background about this book If youre a geek its unputdownable a word that if you think carefully means cannot be put down You may not be aware of this fact since the word is nearly always misused So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast through lunch while hes supposed to be working and on through dinner ignoring the nongeek guests who have come to visit Hell interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks or How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux Hell finish just as the last guest leavesThere is a common myth most likely spread by geeks that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization If youre easily impressed by this kind of propaganda you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work All that sounds pretty badBut lets stop and consider for a moment Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable Hardly Geeks are always doing this kind of thing and society has learned to work around them Important as they may be in the long run theres always some dependable nongeek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon The nongeek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speedchess session and is ready to do whatever it is theyre actually being paid to doSo delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects It will make a great many geeks very happy and assuming of course that the copies are paid for it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaireAnd who could possibly have anything against that   This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seenDo not try any of this at home The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist not a health or safety expert He likes it when things catch fire or explode which means he does not have your best interests in mind The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting directly or indirectly from information contained in this bookThat disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science Dangerous ideas ahead folks Dont get too close  these things could kill yaRandall Munroe used to work at NASA and now he creates the webcomic XKCD which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig On his website he takes absurd hypothetical questions from readers and tries to answer some of them Here are some of my favorite questions in this bookIf you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions this book is for you What made this so much fun aside from the ridiculous questions is Munroes sense of humor Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers which is not something that usually happens when Im reading about science Oh and be sure to read his footnotes which have even more jokesI think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works I think I would have loved it when I was  I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book because I had never heard of the author before Its the miracle of Goodreads    One of the things thats nice about goodreads is that it lets you embed pictures And one of the nice things about xkcd is that it has lots of pictures licensed under CC AttributionNonCommerical  meaning I can post as many as I want to this reviewIm pretty sure that if youre here you already know about xkcd But hey why the heck not Right XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famousThe book comes from his what if blog which is also very goodI took the book into work with me to show it around  you know  hipsteresque and what not Im reading this trendy new book firstBut the guys at my table were all like Yeah I can see myself reading like  or  of these and then putting the book down Everyone more or less nodded in agreement  even though they thought the book was coolThen I looked at the book a little bit more closely flipped through a little bit and thought Huh that sounds about right Thats probably what Im going to doIll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly You know But what if Hitler hadnt killed the Jews Would you like him then or What if Martin Luther King Jr had used violence You have to admit its pretty crazy that weve given this guy a holiday right He has a pointSo I took the book home  slightly shamed that I hadnt realized it was more for coffee tables than actual readingBut then I picked it up and read a couple And a couple more Next thing I know a couple of days later the book is done  and I really enjoyed it And I learned a lot Well presumablyI did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroes math Or any of his conclusions I mean if I did on a couple of these there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right If I could take issue with a couple I am NOT a math guyIn case there arent any flame wars yet let me start one On page  in answer to the question If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks wouldnt the common cold be wiped out he says The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses After a few days your immune system notices and destroys it but not before you infect on average one other person Then he has a footnote which reads Mathematically this must be true If the average were less than one the virus would die out If it were more than one eventually everyone would have a cold all the time But that cant be right Can it Its tough to tell whether hes serious or not because sometimes the footnotes are jokes and other times theyre notBut here it made me question the math of the rest of the book Hes very meticulous in his calculations throughout but here he doesnt factor in seasons or how vast the globe is Wouldnt it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection  and then people stay away from us  and are more cautious in general  which is why the number goes back down but doesnt die out completelyIt took me a while to get over this undermining the whole book for a couple seconds Seriously if he had just said but not before you infect on average on other person I wouldnt have thought twice about itOf course I doubted him on other footnotes pg  Although itsa little different if you drip superglue on cotton thread it will catch fire That cant be right can it Thats another of his jokes RightMunroe also interspersed Weird and worrying questions from the what if inbox Honestly most of these werent any weirder than the questions he was already answering And sometimes I think they only seemed weird but I think he may have missed the trailLike on page  the question is What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it wont hit anything vital and Ill liveTheres a stick figure that says Asking for a friend former friend I meanBut I think its a legitimate question And Im pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM  wasnt it a major plot point So Thomas the person who asked the question wherever you are  I dont think youre a weirdo Yeah yeah yeah spoiler alert if youre reading this in  Although Id be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time its Munroe Hes sure studying that stuff And Einstein And Schrodinger Also probably J Robert Oppenheimer And the book is so dated He mentions the newfangled writing section of the SAT on page  That was dropped way back in   Time travelling  am I rightFinally Munroe  if youre reading this  and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already You may hate it but dont knock it till youve tried it rightSeriously  loved the book Thought I would like it didnt think I would love it Didnt think I would read it the whole way through  finished it in under  daysAlso shouldnt this go under like a scifi shelf Since the questions are hypothetical Isnt this exactly what sciencefiction is Its just not told in narrative form in this case   ChangeOrg Petition Despicable MunroeThe International Astronomical Union recently named an asteroid after Randall Munroe asteroid  Munroe is big enough to cause a mass extinction if it ever hits EarthNot that he needs an asteroid to do that He has his minions devising millions of ways to do it on a subversive site they call xkcdcom This book is a set of leaked manuals It should be clear to all how dangerous this guy and his site really is But all Government agencies fail to heed my warnings I exhort you to read this and then contact your local representative immediately We can stop him Together If you still have doubts let me remind you of numerous disaster movies  there is always only ONE GUY who saw it coming Do you really want to ignore meEager for your supportThanks   "},

"text": "Despite the tumorshrinking medical miracle that has bought her a few years Hazel has never been anything but terminal her final chapter inscribed upon diagnosis But when a gorgeous plot twist named Augustus Waters suddenly appears at Cancer Kid Support Group Hazels story is about to be completely rewrittenInsightful bold irreverent and raw The Fault in Our Stars is awardwinning author John Greens most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet brilliantly exploring the funny thrilling and tragic business of being alive and in love   Since Ive been receiving a lot of cyber bullies and hate messages Im going to clarify few thingsFirstly this is a negative review of the book and it has got a lot of potential to infuriate the fans If you think that your opinion is the only opinion that exists on earth and that no one should dislike your favourite book then I would suggest you to avoid this reviewSecondly This is my review and I have the freedom to analyse and criticise this book as I wish to without being told by others how Im supposed to criticise it I have the freedom to have my own thoughts and to express them in whatever way I want to and I dont appreciate fans shoving their opinions down my throats Im not here to cater the needs of TFIOS fandomThirdly stop harassing me Why cant you get it through your thick skulls that everyone has different opinions theyre going to interpret books differently from you and stop being selfish to think that just because you loved a book that means the whole world should love it This world is full of people with differing opinions differing thoughts and differing likes and differing dislikes learn to respect them even if you dont agree with what they have to say about your favourite books Just because you love a particular book that I hate doesnt make you a good person and me a bad person It simply shows that people like different things Every reader has the freedom to dissect and critically analyse any book and write their thoughts on it in their own review space without the fear of anyone or fans bossing them into writing what the fandom wants Critically analysing books and criticising problematic aspects of any reading material prevents people from being passive readersShakespeare and JK Rowling too have their own share of critics then what makes Greens book flawless that its not allowed to be criticised Honestly this book is nowhere as good as the works of those two geniuses Stop thinking that criticising this book is sacrilegious Fourthly stop cyber bullying and trolling me Your hate messages and death threats will show much more of your personality than your love for this book Remember every time you comment any bullshit here youre giving your own fandom a bad name and my review more popularity Also your hate messages arent going to put me down Im a strong girl and Im always going to stand up for what I believe in come hell or high water I dont fear anyone and no one can ever force me to follow their orders like a puppet especially not a fandom where most of the fans are immature cyber bullies who cant respect others opinions Also Ive caught fans making fake accounts to troll my review this shows me that they are big cowards who hide their faces and send me spiteful commentsLastly Im NOT shaming anyone for loving this book You can love whatever you want to and believe in whomever you want to I have no problem with people who genuinely love this book I have problems with those who think readers should not have the rights to express their dislike for any book I have problems with those who approve of and participate in cyber bullying reviewers who write negative reviews on their favourite books I have problems with those who refuse to acknowledge the fact that their favourite books can have flaws and not everyones going to love them I have problems with those who come here to shove their opinions down my throat Do you find anyone who hated this book shoving their opinions in comments of positive reviews Then what makes you think that you have the rights to troll negative reviewsAlright now lets begin with the review    EXPECTATIONREALITYIve rewritten this review because my previous one contained my angry rant and most of my points were incoherentSo I happily bought the hardcover of The Fault in our stars back in December  after seeing the high average GR ratings and raving reviews saying how beautiful lifechanging thoughtprovoking and blah blah it is Surprisingly this book was so special that it became the first book that I slammed on the wall twice after reading it It didnt only disappoint me but also angered me Im surprised to find that harsh critics are swallowing up this trash and calling it a masterpiece Ugh Im going to make a list of everything I hate about this book that earned it the topmost place on my list of Worst books ever   Hazel and Augustus are the flattest cardboard cutouts I have ever seen in any book Both of them were like yearsold stuck in some teenagers bodies making them very boring and unlikeable Hazel was such an annoying stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face One great example of her stupidityWhy are breakfast foods breakfast foodsLike why dont we have curry for breakfast Augustus and Hazel have the same boring pretentious knowitall and indistinguishable personality Hazel is the female version of Augustus no Im not going to call him affectionately with Gus and he is the male version of Hazel These two characters meld together and have no depth at all I couldnt connect with them I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them   It fell from the sky Seriously I dont get whats so beautiful about the relationship between them They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other    The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustuss house just minutes after meeting him WHAT THE HELL How stupid can you be You fall for a guys words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house What if he were a murderer or rapist Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Franks house was so effing disgusting Anne Franks house is considered to be a place of remembrance a place where  families hid during the dark days of Holocaust If anyone makes out at such a revered site they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are People present around will be disgusted they wont stand and watch much less clap for the lovely couple   Cheesy Emotionless Ambiguous Braincell burning Want to hear some favourite quotes of mine Here they areMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellationsWhy compare your thoughts to stars and constellations sighsSome infinities are bigger than other infinities Thats the thing about pain It demands to be feltYeah thats the thing about chocolate it demands to be eaten I believe the universe wants to be noticed I think the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed And who am I living in the middle of history to tell the universe that itor my observation of itis temporary UmmWhat Im in love with you and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things Im in love with you and I know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitable and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have and I am in love with you view spoilerThere will come a time when all of us are dead All of us There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra let alone you Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away but even if we survive the collapse of our sun we will not survive forever There was time before organisms experienced consciousness and there will be time after And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you I encourage you to ignore it God knows thats what everyone else doesMeThere were senseless dialogues braincell burning metaphors and words thrown around in the book from the dictionary Ill stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine And you know what Teenagers living in the st century DONT speak like that No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds Also genuinely sick teenagers dont have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time One thing I dont buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise They become terrified confused depressed and angry They DONT magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life This book made me roll my eyes in disgust      Predictable Boring Uninspiring Put me to sleep I had to plough through the whole book Cancer is hard its painful but this book didnt show me that I couldnt feel Hazel and Augustus struggle against it I couldnt feel their pain TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novelMe throughout the bookI knew that someone would die Augustuss death wasnt powerful enough if Green wouldve shown his death I wouldve understood why the world cried a whole bucket over himHe died eight days after his prefuneralWHAT THE HELL Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEKOk so this book made you cry right If a book makes you cry it automatically doesnt mean that its a masterpiece I can understand that you mustve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and mustve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesnt make it an awesome lifechanging and beautiful story I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion it was one of the worst books I ever read    I dont understand why people compare The Fault in our stars to The Book Thief by Markus Zusak Zusak is a genius he handles his themes death love joy pain grief etc  brilliantly in his book he is an artist of words painter of vivid imagination his writing has enough power to break your heart and mend it on the same page TFios pales in comparison to a gem like The Book Thief I would rather shed my tears for a sick kid who doesnt know how to create a fking metaphor than to shed my tear on any of Augustus and Hazels ridiculous monologues I would rather shed my tears for the children dying in the civil war in Syria than cry buckets over the death of a pretentious unlikeable and flat character Before you start calling me a coldhearted bitch for hating and criticising this book let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not I know that Im the only teenager on this planet who hates this book but honestly I dont care Would I recommend it NO I would rather recommend The Book Thief because it deserves the huge hype rather than this trashShailene Woodley has been cast as Hazel for the movieShes simply perfect for Hazels boring and unlikeable personality I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or cant have a large vocabulary dont accuse me of something I havent said I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think its appropriate to use them in their conversationsIm awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard  Like wtfEspecially when they are living in the st century because English language is completely different than what it was few centuries ago Also its hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single timeI am a teen and I go to high school I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age I know teens roughly my age with almost perfect speaking and writing skills in English They write amazing poems and honestly it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously sayMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellationsBtw none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry the only book Hazel claims to read is An Imperial Affliction then whats the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues What reason do they have to have a large vocabulary They arent geniuses they arent teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory or love for poetry Therefore its not plausible for them to speak with profound wordsMoving on the quotes and metaphors in this book are stupid and cliched On deeper analysis youll understand that the philosophy in this book is not real philosophy its simply marketing Take for example this quoteLife is not a wish granting factoryHow many times have I heard this outside the book For me the quote above is not a good one Why Ive been told since I was  that life wont give you everything you want A good quote imo tells you something new and it makes you ponder over a new thing in the case of the quote above it tells me nothing new it shows me nothing new and doesnt make me think about anything new because Ive already thought over the unfairness of life  times before That quote is just paraphrased and the whole book is littered with such paraphrased version of quotes that we already come across daily in our lives in simple version People fall for such quotes because its written with profound words that make them feel that TFIOS teaches a lot of new things John Green is not a good author hes simply a marketing genius He has nothing new and interesting to tell and writeNow going over the cigarette metaphor Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus giving us another stupid dialogue Its a metaphor You keep the killing thing between your teeth but dont give it the power to kill you Funny that he wont kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others What a genius Not to mention that he mocks Hazels cancer right on her face and guess her reaction Shes impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphorTheres a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter I dont buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible Theres no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK and Im analysing only the book nothing outside it so why should I listen to an outside source Ive read Greens post on Augustus character being pretentious and imo he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious they are extremely unrealistic as well Augustus pretension is not an intentional flaw its simply poor characterisationIm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge Dont twist my wordsI couldnt sympathise with the characters and feel their pain That doesnt mean that Im cold hearted Its not my fault that I couldnt get emotionally connected to the characters its the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with Its the authors fault for making shallow judgemental and annoying characters Its the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust Its the authors fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book Im NOT hating people who have cancer Im NOT hating the characters because they have cancer Im hating them for who they are Im hating the book because its poorly written I dont need to have cancer to analyse this book Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book And before you say omg you dont have cancer and youre not dying so youll obviously not understand this book let me tell you that you know nothing about me You dont know what Im going through you dont know my lifeline then what gives you the right to judge what my life is likeIll leave you with another quoteI got bored of this book the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at onceend rantbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   At age twentytwo John Green worked as a student chaplain in a childrens hospital Lets take a moment and consider all the implications of that and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as devastating That was about twelve years ago and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience hes spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer  not poster children of strength and courage and illnessgranted wisdom but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young All novels are personal but Greens novels seem to me to be especially so But this one is personal in a different way With this novel Green isnt trying to exorcize the memory of the girl who stomped on his heart in high school This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst This is about life death illness love heroism and how a sixteenyearold is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind Maybe its just because Ive been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like Im actually acquainted with John Green but this is the most deeply personal novel Ive ever read This is not as Hazel Lancaster might say a Cancer Book None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically Hazel Lancaster a terminal sixteenyearold who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because my lungs suck at being lungs is refreshingly real  not manic not a pixie not a dream girl She reads Great Books and watches Americas Next Top Model marathons Augustus Waters her amputee friend wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game can I say how much I love that an author can establish a characters intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen yes Stephenie Meyer Im looking at you Everything here is real especially the diseases There isnt any bullshit about dying gracefully here because cancer is ugly and unpleasant and Green makes you feel Hazels lungs struggling to breathe and the pain and see the vomit and urine Remember how in A Walk to Remember Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients Most importantly Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer It consumes their lives but it doesnt define them On every page its clear this is a story told by someone who hasnt known just one person with cancer but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families Its for that reason that I dont feel like I can review this like a normal book John Green didnt write this story for me and so I dont feel like I have any place saying that its amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking And I certainly cant criticize any of its minor faults All I can say really is that you have to read this for yourself and go from there Okay you guys know me better than that I have one big complaint which I will describe here and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars Augustus Waters in the first few chapters comes off as a pretentious douche When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group theyre talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth Hazel who youll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function freaks out even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER Augustus explains that he doesnt smoke the cigarettes he just puts them in his mouth no really because They dont kill you unless you light themAnd Ive never lit one Its a metaphor see you put the killing thing right between your teeth but you dont give it the power to do its killing Augustus I love you but youre full of shit right there Notice how he didnt address Hazels perfectly valid point that by buying cigarettes Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer Because heres the thing you can say to a cigarette company Im buying your cigarettes as a metaphor but I wont light them so Im taking away their power and theyll stop listening at Im buying your cigarettes because thats all they care about And its a shit metaphor in any case you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because its unloaded youve taken away its power but youre still going to get arrested So that was annoying as was Augustuss general air of overlycharming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning But I forgive him for it because lest we forget he is seventeen If his character was twentytwo hed be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet but because hes just a kid I was willing to forgive him Still hate the cigarette thing though   This is me after I finished the book and whenever I think about itpointless EDIT Woooah  likes Im surprised how many people are willing to read my little blurb of nothingness EDIT In a lot of peoples reviews I keep seeing they dont talk their age or They make these beautiful long speeches which is something that normal teenagers dont do and I have to point out that Augustus and Hazel ARENT normal teenagers Theyve had to go through so much more in their lifetime than a lot of teenagers will ever have to and its aged them And quite honestly this book wouldnt be as good if they were normal whatever that means sighs okay Im done proceed with reading If you want to Im just tiny words on a screen Do whatever you wantAs much of an amazing writer as I want to be Im really not So Ill just point out the things that made this book amazing I knew that I would cry so I really didnt bother swearing not to cry What I didnt expect is bawling my eyes out I really didnt John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me When they cried I cried bawled When they laughed I laughed When they melted I melted Their romance was so epic and I know I KNOW that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time The characters were perfection Especially Augustus Waters Not only is his name Augustus which is epic in itself He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him Nice guys finish last I think not You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag Just look up there and youll see a little tag that says thefaultinourstars It was THAT amazing Seriously So amazing that Im pretty sure it was my first heartbreak from a book I really havent felt that much from a book much less a person in a very long time Im kind of a loner and a commitment phob not a good mix But my heart didnt just do this  it did this  BOOM didnt have a sign for thatI wish I could write more about this book but I just cant explain the amazingness of it with my simple unworthy words so I am going to tell you what you NEED to do READ IT    John GreenJohn GreenJohn GreenYoure not like Peter Van Houten are youWhat have you done to my brainand my heartIm not gonna review how exquisite John Green can write or how he can create characters as special as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters or how amazing he can tell a story Despite the huge number of ratings and the spectacular average rating this book is not perfect You might find it unrealistic because if there are many of us who see the life and its complexity like Hazel and Gus do this world will be such a happy place So like any other book this one also might be a miss or a hit If its a miss then you can say its not worth the hype But if its a hit it hits hard Everything in this book the characters the story the words they all have the power to be an inspiration If you havent read it I suggest to take the chance     starsEDIT Changed the rating because its gotten to the point where my sister and I have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is I cant think about this book without getting angryI have a history with pretentious peopleMy biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life I openly expressed my dislike to them They know that I couldnt care less about their hotness or just how amazing they were So goddamn full of themselves spoiled rotten just overall horrible peopleIn short my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship Id dive into it but then this wouldnt be a book reviewAnd so I move onThe Fault in Our Stars is my first John Green bookYeah I know but I didnt really get into reading up until maybe four years ago And Im not too into contemporary but the opportunity presented itself and I took my first dive My sister is a fan of John Green She really loves Looking for Alaska and Will Grayson Will Grayson and finds Paper Towns to be LfAs quirky New Girl twin that doesnt own upI almost feel bad for disliking this book but thats strictly on the idea of cancer Cancer is horrible unpredictable and the worst part is that its your own cells mutating against you Thats why its so hard to defeat Thats what I wish this book was about dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you Instead I get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps Hazel alive so she can have a boy love her view spoilerthen die not even on sight either I came into this book with an open mind I assure you But I ended up really wanting to put the book down several times From the first few pages I felt something was actually wrong Like I didnt know what I was getting myself into Having finished this book which to me was such a chore to do I think Ive stumbled upon decent reasons as to why I really cant give this any more than two starsIf you didnt know by now The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug But because her cancer life is just so boring a boy has to make it betterBecause that is the only way anything gets better in lifeBoyzCancer People Dear ReadersWRITINGThis was by far the largest problem I had Larger than Hazel saying I wanna tap that about Augustus on page  This prose was not the voice of a real teenager It tried but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer This was the voice of a teenager who liked to say You know what sucks Cancer You know what else sucks Dying Why So the reader could laughAnd wouldnt you know it every line is like that There is no rest for any real emotion or interest Its all laced with some oneliner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when its just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested And this alone made me find great distaste in the character of Hazel She is not believable because I never learned anything about her She just hates Support Group and adores Augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book Oh you like Guss smile his laugh The idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy The idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesnt do anything but make him look like a pretentious assholeOh who am I kidding This entire book was shallow and pretentious Everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food Those poor scrambled eggs No I dont give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression But think about it We only have eggs for breakfast Because you choose to point it out as suchOr get this how about the hurdles event in track You know what Augustus says about hurdles He says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holesAnd I wondered if the hurdlers ever thought you know This would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdlesTHIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOKAugustus Waters actual athlete says something like this about a sport Sports are a very healthy way to escape stress If anything Augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers HURDLES ARE A SPECIAL EVENT The hurdlers are probably doing a running event too They CHOSE to run the hurdles for the challengeBut this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs Hey If we talk about this and make it sound funny itll be deep Itll really scratch the heads of the readers This just shows how silly and thoughtful Augustus is Dont you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that HE SPENDS MONEY ON FOR NO FUCKING REASONGuh you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch This was the line by the way that got me in that level of dislike for Augustus that I got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life And Hazel just sort of accepts this Like what the hell is everyone thinking in this book What universe are they in Because this is not a real universeI think now Im tracking into character territory so hereCHARACTERSHazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as cancer to the balls and then she sees Augustus Waters on page  of this book and goes Look let me just say it He was hot A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is at best awkward and at worst a form of assault But a hot boywellRemember if youre not drop dead gorgeous men your nice glances are only awkward Thats it You can never go farther and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl Because you are just not sexy enough or Augustinian for it Hazel likes to do this She likes to put down other guys for her Gus even though they still BARELY knew each otherI met Kaitlyn and her cute but frankly not Augustinian boyfriend for coffee one afternoonLOOK AT THAT What What is that This was a nice guy and Hazels like Well hes not a fucking Greek God so no thank you But what about Augustus Hazel You went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldnt like because you were a girl MOVIES DONT WORK LIKE THAT What are you even doingYou know what I just realized Hazel is a lot like Mary in The Forest of Hands and Teeth She hates one thing and loves only one material thing Hazel hates the cancer support group and loves An Imperial Affliction Mary hates the Unconsecrated but loves the ocean Thats all they have to their name Which is AMAZING to me that Augustus finds something to love about Hazel All it is is her John Green witIf you asked Gus what else was there to Hazel besides this one book thing and her wit I bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as Derek in Swan Princess did with What else is thereBecause thats all their love is Theyre not bonding over the fact they have cancer They bonded over An Imperial Affliction then experienced an intensified Hey Arnold Episode about visiting the author who to no ones surprise I hope was a complete jackass then makes a  becausebecause Who needs reasonsHOWEVER the half star is devoted to Mr Peter Van Houten who was the only actual character in this book Everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes When Van Houten did it there was history behind it and a REASON He actually had an arc He did things Despite my lack of care for Augustus and Hazel the way Peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye But he changed and revealed WHY he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good characterSTRUCTUREStructure was fineStill flowed okay despite my need to be done with thisOVERALLI honestly thought everything was funny I laugh at a loooooot of stuff This whatever this is is not really that funny Its shallow and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle Its a cancerfilled girl loving view spoilerand losing  a cancerfilled boy Oh and they meet their favorite author whos actually an asshole Cancer is the backseat and I almost find it insultingI dont understand why people love this Tell me all you want that Augustus is a beautiful boy and Hazel just wanted something different in her life but dont you DARE tell me that this is deep This is not a deep book theres nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his  yearold ray of sunshineI could go on but I think this is enough If it isnt well thats your opinion This is mine You are just gonna have to dealFinal RemarksThis book should have been about what happened to Peter Van HoutenItd be perfectly parallel to that Hey Arnold episode I mentioned but itd be better than what I readOR this book should have been about Hazel WITH THE TERMINAL CANCER Because her inner conflict with cancer

"text": "A terrible darkness has fallen upon Jacob Weiszs beloved Germany The Nazi regime under the leadership of Adolf Hitler has surged to power and now hold Germany by the throat All nonAryans  especially Jews like Jacob and his family  are treated like dogsWhen tragedy strikes during one terrible night of violence Jacob flees and joins rebel forces working to undermine the regime But after a raid goes horribly wrong Jacob finds himself in a living nightmare  trapped in a crowded stinking car on the train to the Auschwitz death campAs World War II rages and Hitler begins implementing his final solution to systematically and ruthlessly exterminate the Jewish people Jacob must rely on his wits and a God hes not sure he believes in to somehow escape from Auschwitz and alert the world to the Nazis atrocities before Fascism overtakes all of Europe The fate of millions hangs in the balance Only  are known to have escaped Auschwitz The most notable are Witold Pilecki a Pole who volunteered to go into Auschwitz and report to the world what he had seen and Rudolf Vrba a Slovakian Jew who escaped at age  The escape is told almost exactly how Rudolf Vrba and a friend escaped  by hiding in a pile of wood outside of the electrified fences and waiting three days searches went on for  hoursI cannot describe how much I loved this book The characters were realistic but amazing the plot was wellresearched and I really enjoyed the way Rosenberg handled Christianity Only one main character Luc was a Christian and he was just fabulous Hes not your average Christian and even Rosenberg knows it Many of the guards who beat kill and torture six days in the week  faithfully go to church every Sunday Jacob the protagonist does not become a Christian but he is deeply moved by Lucs passion for helping Jews Luc admits Martin Luther was the source of Hitlers propaganda and during an emotional scene apologized to Jacob for every wrong thing Christians have done to Jews throughout the years Protestant pastor Luc lets his Christian beliefs shine through his actions  he never tries to convert anybody I simply love that about him and wish more Christians would follow his example He refuses to ignore the horrors of the Holocaust and remain ignorant like the majority of Christians in Europe did Luc from a little village called Le Chambon in France represents the real Christians there that rescued around  Jews I love Le Chambon and really enjoyed how Rosenberg weaved that amazing story into the plot of his novel Jacobs arrest while not similar to Vrbas is based on the reallife Twentieth Train rescue  Jews escaped but only  actually survivedIt has been a whole month thats a long time for me since I last read a book I even enjoyed about a year since I read something that moved me this much and the first time Ive stayed up until  AM to finish a book The last time I read a book that moved me to tears was about a year ago The last time I read a book where I loved another character as much as I loved Luc was about  years ago  and that was the book that began my WWII journey That book was I Am DavidAlthough I am a bookworm I have never really read such an actionpacked thriller before that I seriously could not put down I have never read for over  solid consecutive hours The last  is nonstop action but not in a cheesy Hollywood wayI cannot speak highly enough of this book and will certainly be adding it to my Top  List I would certainly highly recommend to everyone You will not be disappointedThe real story httpflashtrafficblogwordpresscomPBS Docudrama on the real story full httpwwwpbsorgwnetsecretsepiso    As this story is based on horrific and unimaginable actual events it is scarier to me than a horror novel and will remain with meI was in tears at several points in this book as it has brutal details of life at Auschwitz I was captivated by the story and was  rooting for an escape that would lead to some quick action by the Allies to change the fate of these innocent people The notes describe the fictional vs the factual points of the book Fact  less than  people escaped from this hellhole Heartwarming was the story of Luc and others in his small French village who were Christians who rescued over  Jews and found them homes in several venues  this doesnt sound like many people saved but it was more than the population of this small town This is based on factAnytime I read a book that takes place over this period I cant understand the how and the why How is it possible that the world did not know and and waited so long to help Why would a nation get behind this lunatic and why didnt more people act with morality I did not fully like the religious Christian and Jewish undertones that the book took on at places a bit over the top I also thought that the plot had a few holes However this grabbed my heart and that is why I have rated it  starsI recommend this to fans of Historical Fiction and WWII especially Have a box of tissues handy   DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT EVER READ THIS BOOKAccording to Joel C Rosenberg its okay that  million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis because not ALL of the Jews died God got the Jews through it just like he saw them through Egyptian slavery Sure he only managed to save like  max of those who went into concentration camps but its all good Because he came through at the end You know after the Nazis had nearly finished what they set out to do effectively wiping out European Jewry as a whole because those who did survive immediately booked it for Palestine and the USAlso did you know Christians were not responsible Even though Ive never heard someone blame Christians for the Holocaust Joel C Rosenberg makes a hell of a lot of excuses for them and how even churchgoing Nazis werent real Christians No shit But Christians across Europe are culpable in the fact that a very very tiny percentage of nonJews in Europe actually did something to save the Jews Denmark and the French city of Le Chambon were anomalies in terms of actual communities of people who worked together to save Jews as were the individuals who made up various resistance groups but the MAJORITY of Christians in Europe were not only apathetic but were in fact COMPLICIT in the Holocaust especially in Poland where most threw morality and values out the window to turn in their Jewish neighbors to the police so they could be rewarded with loaves of bread I dont blame these people  they did what they had to in order to survive even if it meant culpability in systematic murder But this book basically asserts that all Christians in Europe were saints because they loved Jesus so much and Jesus was Jewish He spends less of the book on his weak plot and more on trying to get us to believe that Christians have literally zero responsibility for what happened He also seems to believe that Polish Christians were evangelical Protestants when in fact like  of Poles were Roman Catholic but I digressIts so alarmingly offensive I really dont even know where to begin Aside from Rosenberg making excuses on every other page and aside from him making every character try to force their belief in God in the main character Jacob Weisz who SHOCKER believes in God by the end of the book there are just so many problematic issuesI rolled my eyes at the less offensive nonsense but mostly gritted my teeth in rageOne of the best things ever was when Jacob fell in love with Abby who worked in the medical clinic and was part of the underground resistance along with him As hes getting ready to escape she gives him a gift and tells him to open it once they get outside So Jacob and Luc a French pastor escape naturally with a bunch of close calls But oh noes theyre really sick So Jacob decides to open the package Its from the medical clinic and theyre sick so youre thinking its gonna be medicine right WRONG ITS BIBLES Bibles If I just escaped a DEATH CAMP and had to run a couple hundred miles through a Polish forest crawling with people there to hunt me while running a fever the last thing Id want is a BIBLE But of course Jacob is like maybe God is watching out for me UGH UGH UGH UGHBasically the author is trying to say that Jews shouldnt have lost faith in God during the Holocaust because sometimes he looked out for his chosen people and even though it happened God ended it I mean come on God Too little too late amirite Of course many Jews did hold onto their faith because it got them through difficult times If that was how Rosenberg described things Id be totally onboard But those who did lose faith had a pretty valid reason They dont need some asshat who could barely do his research to come around  years later and explain why they should have all kept their faithTheres a lot to hate about this book but on top of everything the research done was abysmal Two sentences in a character quotes some madeup book Its  and the quote is evil unchecked is the prelude to genocide COOL except the word genocide didnt actually exist in a wide scale vernacular until  when it was coined and introduced by Raphael Lemkin That one little factual error irked me to my core but I clearly didnt know what was coming Id say like  of the anecdotes in and around the camps come straight from Laurence Rees Auschwitz There are smaller errors some intentional ie changing the dates Dr Mengele worked at the camp so it fit his narrative but most not Its just a mess of a book True god awful trash I picked it up because of the high ratings and then I remembered that most people are dumb and give this book a  because of Jesus and not because its actually good To be fair without Rosenbergs obnoxious proselytizing it moves quickly and tells a compelling story but it truly is evangelical propaganda thinly disguised as historical fiction If anything its religious fiction and Rosenberg should be ashamed of himself for taking a Jewish tragedy and turning it into a Christian missionary tale No Christians were not responsible for the Holocaust it was about racial makeup not religion I dont think anyone has ever blamed Christians for the atrocities committed But at the same time Christianity is not a solution to the suffering caused by the Nazis Doing this is SO problematic because youre essentially saying that its okay that Nazis killed millions of people because God eventually swooped in and saved a few WRONG GROSS AND WRONG    Where books are burned they will in the end burn people tooAfter a failed attempt by the freedom fighters to release the captured Jews from the disgusting cattle cars young Jacob Weisz finds himself locked inside and on his way to the dreaded hard labor camp of Auschwitz where within its evil barbed wire he thinks of nothing but escapeAs he witnesses the brutality sees the emaciated walking skeletons and learns the true secrets of the death factory it is he questions his faith in God as he struggles to survive from exhaustion and starvationAs the story continues Jacob eventually meets Pastor JeanLuc Leclerc a true believer in the Christian faith This novel wastes no time getting into the meat of it and kept my attention right through to the end Fast read   Another nailbiter by one of my favorite authors I loved this book I just simply couldnt put it down I read it in less than a week I kept thinking that it was a true story It was truly a work of history and suspense A hard book to write Im sure The author did a marvelous job taking true facts and weaving a fictitious character into them without sacrificing the true history I love World War Two and this book did not disappoint It was heart wrenching and accurate I am looking forward to more books by Joel C Rosenberg in the future Thank you Mr Rosenberg for all the hard work you put in to make this book enjoyable to a history buff like me I never once had to be frustrated with this work of historical fiction We can never forget what happened in the Holocaust as long as we have authors like this   "},

seven he encountered a most remarkable girl Lettie Hempstock and her mother and grandmother He hasnt thought of Lettie in decades and yet as he sits by the pond a pond that shed claimed was an ocean behind the ramshackle old farmhouse the unremembered past comes flooding back And it is a past too strange too frightening too dangerous to have happened to anyone let alone a small boyForty years earlier a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road Like a fuse on a firework his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways The darkness was unleashed something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy And Lettiemagical comforting wise beyond her yearspromised to protect him no matter whatA groundbreaking work from a master The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out It is a stirring terrifying and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterflys wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark Sitting down to write a review of this book I dont quite know where to start I was going to quote a passage that I particularly loved But no good can come of that Once I opened that door where would I stop quoting So let me say this I genuinely loved this book I look forward to reading it again I will buy copies for my family as gifts I will listen to the audio and lament my own lack of narrative skill I will gush about it to strangers In short it is a Neil Gaiman novel There is truth here and beauty and joy and a sad sweet melancholy that moves through my chest like distant thunder I realize that what I am writing here is not really a review in any conventional sense It is a paen A panegyric It is the textual equivalent of a huge happy gormless grin And you know what Im fine with that Let the professionals write their reviews Let them get all jargony about it Let them try to pin this book to the page not realizing that a pinned butterfly holds no delight A pinned butterfly is nothing like a butterfly at all I make no claims to impartiality in regard to Gaimans work Sandman changed how I thought about stories Neverwhere was a talisman for me Stardust is a golden bell hung in my heart And American Gods taught me that there was a name for the sort of book I was struggling to write It was a picaresque So if youre looking for impartiality this is not the review for you Look elsewhere Me I will enjoy The Ocean at the End of the Lane without dissection It made me happy It made me feel less alone It made me love Neil Gaiman a little more than I already did and thats something I didnt think was possibleDo I hope to someday write a book like this No I never could Hes done something odd and strange and lovely here I couldnt hope to replicate it Instead this is what I hope In the future when Joss Whedon and I are best friends and hanging out together in my tree fort I hope Neil Gaiman comes over too Because then the three of us will all play Settlers of Catan together And I will win because Im really great at Settlers of Catan But I will also be very gracious about it and apologize for putting the bandit on Gaimans wheat twice in a row Then we will make smores and I will toast a marshmallow with such deftness and perfection that they will be amazed and realize I am kinda cool Then we will talk about Battlestar Galactica and which Doctor is our favorite and we will tell ghost stories late into the night God Im tired I should really go to sleep I have no idea what Im saying anymore I hope I dont regret this in the morning      This story is an amalgam of helplessness and innocent ignorance of childhood with universeold wisdom with mystery and wonder and unexplainable and unfathomable and things that lurk around the corners of reality and seep through the cracks in the world Theres friendship and love and cruelty and resentment And there are monsters  and in the true fashion of the tradition I love the real monsters come from the peoples wishes the peoples own selves the deep down dark that lives inside us  Maybe once upon a time you were seven and bookish and lonely and sometimes a stranger to your own parents Maybe your first experience with deaths brought into your world a strange family of three living just down the lane in a little farmhouse  the Maiden the Mother and the Crone of the fairytales Maybe your first ever friend elevenyearold or maybe infinitiesold who knows Lettie Hempstock the girl for whom in your sevenyearolds sense of own immortality you nevertheless are  will take you on an unexpectedly sinister journey culminating somewhere and somewhen under the haunting orange sky And maybe after that nothing will ever be the same  And maybe something from underneath that sinister sky will choose you as a way to break through reality into your little secure world of a child And maybe because of that you will come to a terrifying realization that the world is not safe that adults may not be there to protect you that world has teeth and is ready to bite you with them any time it wants to And you realize that nothing is as it seems  and that theres no reason why the pond cannot be Lettie Hempstocks ocean after all  There are certain authors that in my mind have become a genre of their own Neil Gaiman is one of them When I read his books I dont read fantasy or urban fantasy or any other such label What I read is    a unique blend of humor and dry wit and a strong narrative voice making the strangest leaps of imagination seem like nothing out of ordinary And every time when I put down the book of his Ive been reading into the wee hours of the night unable to stop I find myself with a haunting sense of longing and missing the world he created the world into which he so effortlessly immerses his readers the world of his storytelling that you never want to leave Its like Lettie Hempstocks ocean the waters of which you wish you never had to leave but where you cannot stay forever no matter how badly you would want to  Neil Gaiman again is at his best which for him is I guess just ordinary This book will join my personal favorites by him  especially The Graveyard Book to which its a soul cousin And I will revisit it in the future probably more than once just to hang out with Lettie and Old Mrs Hempstock and maybe to catch the hint of a wave on an ancient worldocean in the back yard stars       This book is childhoodAre all Neil Gaiman books like this So beautifully hauntingly nostalgic I confess this is my first but right now I am logging into amazon to make sure it isnt my last I have one criticism which is that this book isnt really an adult book The few adult scenes felt added as an afterthought to try and convince us little people that this is actually a very grownup kinda story But take out that dodgy sex scene and I would have been mesmerised and terrified by this book as a kid perhaps even more than I was reading it today It has everything that we could possibly ask for in childhood magic adventure overcoming fears those things that children know and adults no longer understand or remember and its all wrapped up in a tidy  pages Theres an almost dreamlike quality to the story and there are many reasons its hard to know whats real and what is not The book opens with a middleaged man revisiting the place where he used to live with his parents and sister when he was a young boy of seven He visits his old house before wandering down to the farm at the end of the lane a place that starts to bring back a strange sequence of memories as seen through the eyes of a young boy How real are the magic and monsters of our childhood When we look back and see ignorant youths believing in the impossible are we enlightened adults Or are we the ignorant ones blinded by years dedicated to being sensible and not believing Are the villains we remember monsters from another world Or is that just how children make sense of the people who brought upheaval into their livesI found it truly fascinatingThe creepy yet beautiful setting in the English countryside was fantastic A little lonely somewhat isolated like a world entirely of its own in which anything could be possible This book held all the charm and beauty of the world portrayed in Cider With Rosie but was ten times more compelling and addictive And there were the characters of course Lettie Hempstock an eleven year old who might just have been eleven for a very long time and her quirky mother and grandmother Also the narrator had my sympathy throughout his seven year old lack of understanding and fear of the adult world that he saw as separate from his own was easily believable for me I think we do create a world of our own when were kids one that adults arent a part of thats how were able to believe in things like magic and wizards and Santa To put it plainly I really enjoyed my first trip into the world of Gaiman The ending is perfect A little sad But mostly perfectBlog  Leafmarks  Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  Tumblr      hours ago when I read the last page for the first time I had this strange sad feeling Like I had come to the end of something beautiful without really comprehending the beauty of it until the last minuteWhich is why it took me a reread to realize how brilliant this book isShort Sweet Magical Scary RealThere is a reason this book is labelled as adult and it has nothing to do with sexual content or violence or gore To be an adult by age is meaningless because to truly appreciate this book you must be an adult by experience You must be adult enough to miss childhoodMe Im not there yet I dont miss being a child because I remember being a child I can still see it when I turn backSo right now no This is not my favorite Gaiman bookBut in odd years it probably will beBecause The Ocean at the End of the Lane is one of those booksIt can only grow in appeal the older you get     In the acknowledgments section of his latest novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane Neil Gaiman admits that the project was initially meant to be a short story which grew to be a novel  not a very long novel but a novel nonetheless For fans it was big news as it would be his first novel for adults since s Anansi BoysI was never really into Gaimans work  I wasnt crazy about American Gods or Neverwhere and Coraline all of which are routinely mentioned as fan favorites I loved Stardust though  his short fantasy which I thought was beautiful and had to read in one sitting The Ocean sounded like a a welcome return to the familiar field and I was compelled to give it a tryGaimans narrator is an unnamed English man in his forties who returns to his childhood home located in the English countryside of Sussex There he is drawn to familiar places which he has not seen for ages and which evoke memories long buried He ends up by the house of his childhood friend Lettie Hempstock and remembers when he was seven years old and how Lettie used to call the pond beside her house an oceanUltimately this is a lazy book  for several reasons The first one is an enormously flat and dull narrative voice The narrator is obviously remembering his youth from an adult perspective but the end effect is reduced to sentences in vein of I did this and that And then this happened Theres absolutely no childish joy or fear or even the adults surprise at a sudden recollection of a forgotten memory of youth The language is lackluster flavorless and as flat as the steppes of Kazakhstan to the point of becoming downright dull and distracting because of its dullness How are the readers supposed to give a damn if we can barely muster the strength to turn the pagePerhaps its my own recent personal experience of spending a week in an English village while visiting my friends but I thought that the setting of this book was another lost opportunity The countryside is beautiful but all the the reader will get from it in this book is the fact that people live on farms and sometimes have small ponds near their houses Theres no sense of place specific to Sussex or England in this book at all it could as well have taken place in the suburbs of ChicagoNot that long ago I read and reviewed  the debut novel of Jonathan Carroll a fan favorite considered to be classic of fantasy  which I found to b a bland play on fantasy tropes without much originality I have the same complaints about The Ocean  which really is nothing more than an overly stretched short story employing all the well known staples of the genre and made up to resemble a short novel The protagonist is an obvious standin for the author but besides waxing nostalgia and melancholy the novel doesnt seem to have any real goal or accomplish anything in particular It reads almost like Neil Gaimans rushed assignment for a creative writing class he took ages ago  full of pretension of powerful statements about human beings deep as the ocean but in reality being little else than the wellknown drizzle deep no more than an ordinary puddle which evaporates after a few days and leaves absolutely no mark    "},

"text": "Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith author of the  international bestseller When novelist Owen Quine goes missing his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike At first Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few daysas he has done beforeand she wants Strike to find him and bring him homeBut as Strike investigates it becomes clear that there is more to Quines disappearance than his wife realizes The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous penportraits of almost everyone he knows If the novel were to be published it would ruin livesmeaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silencedWhen Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before     Yes  Pun intended   If you are respectably active on the reading community it will be no surprise that this Robert Galbraith is really the megafamous writer JK Rowling author of the ultramegafamous book series of Harry Potter Why bother on making up the pseudonym when it was revealed after like two weeks when the first novel of this different series got out thats a mystery to me Yes another pun intended P Evidently the genre topics and setting of the Cormoran Strike book series is totally different from what you find on Harry Potter but there are other authors writing different kind of genres and to different target audiences and still they keep their own established author namesAnyway the relevant point here is that Robert Galbraith doesnt exist but JK Rowling definitely exist and a lot in the literary world  While this still is a fictional detective mystery novel I think that easily can be one of the most personal books that JK Rowling ever written Due that in the first book of this series she chose the world of modeling and couture but in this second novel she is opting to use the world of publishing books as the ambiance for the mystery to solve  The story is set like eight months later of the previous book and if you hadnt read it yet but you just cant wait to read this one you can do it since while its a series you will get the very basic highlights that you need to know to get into the second book BUT without spoiling the culprit on the first novel So you can even read both books in reverse order and you still be able to enjoy and get surprised in both novelsNow Cormoran Strikes business is rising up thanks to his success in solving the Lula Landrys case The lovely Robin is still his assistant THANK YOU JK ROWLING I LOVE YOU FOR THAT and the good thing is that her role in this book series will be growing and growing While Robin was my anchor on the first novel and the main reason to keep reading and reading the first book I am truly glad to mention that I still love Robin BUT now I do like a lot the character of Cormoran Strike too and there is no doubt that he is the truly main character of the series The two of them now are making a wonderful team Beware villains Here comes Strike and Robin Yes this is a third pun intended Please indulge me  Strike has been quite busy getting a lot of clients meaning that his business of private detective is finally afloat However he is kinda dissapointed that many of these cases are basically discovering cheating spouses or crooked politicians so when he finds in front of him what it seems the chance of helping a helpless old woman to find her husband he accepts even while the chance of getting a payment out of this seems really unlikely    I am truly glad to mention that while the first book took like an  of writing to boost my interest in here it was right from the beginning In the first book it was like monotonous interviews basically asking the same questions and reliving the same crime scene on and on and onzzzhmmh Oh rightIn here while he still does interviews each of those are really interesting asking different stuff looking for different angles on the case Also another good thing was that while in the first book you get to know irrelevant moments of Strikes personal life in this second novel Rowling was able to exploit each personal moment to be totally involved in the case The story is focused on the case however there were some scenes mentioning other cases where Strike is working too Yes I understand that in real life detectives work in several cases at the same time but in literature one doesnt want to lose time reading about irrelevant cases that arent the main storyI commented on the first book that it could be better with less pages and I was glad to see that this second novel has less pages than the first book making the rhythm of the story more fluent However if Rowling can make the third novel since I do hope the making of a third book in the series with even less pages I really think that this book series can be a total blast having novels with  pages or less focusing in scenes only about the main case  I was delighted to know that I was wrong about who the culprit was on this case I think that any reader of detective novels invested time in the middle of the reading experience trying to deduce who did it And again JK Rowling surprised me with a great process by Strike joining the clues and exposing the case And when Strike is explaining it you say Wow Yes hes right All those clues were there  Well JK Rowling you did it again And even better  This second book is a real proof that lightnings can strike twice JK Rowling brought magic to the hearts of readers with Harry Potter and now she is thrilling them with Cormoran StrikeDefinitely this second novel is an enormous improvement from the overall reading experience of the first book now the book series is on tracks and I can hardly wait for the third novelHighly recommended    Its not an easy task but every day I do my best to read a bit of all those novels out there    Welcome I still see him as Hugh Jackman with some hair style to matchand Emma Watson as his adorable blonde smart secretary RobinAnd Welcome to The Case of the Manuscript of    Well dont look at me just like thatits      Mohammed ArabeyActual Read from st July To  Aug First Preview is hiddenview

    And just like that JK Rowling under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith takes on the familiar to her world of writing and publishing bringing to light the petty conflicts backstabbing attitudes hurtful gossips and inflated egos The bared claws and atyourthroat attitudes the dislikes and grudges held between successful writers and less successful ones the wannabe writers the ones who can and cannot write well the agents the publishers  it all looks like an ugly mess to say the least  This unpleasant world serves as a backdrop for a rather gruesome murder    that matches precisely the final scene in the victims book The victim Owen Quine is a nottoosuccessful writer and frankly a very unpleasant person whose latest book seems to focus on trashtalking everyone connected to him in the literary world and personal life and pisses off quite a number of people In fact it seems to have upset someone enough to brutally murder Quine in a way that combines intestines and hydrochloric acid and a feeling of nausea trying to imagine the resulting crime sceneIt of course falls to the private detective Cormoran Strike who recently solved the murder of Lula Landry earning himself some notoriety and a bit of cash to untangle this mess and find the killer Yet again hes aided by his secretary Robin Ellacott who having worked with Strike for a while now dreams of receiving some investigative training herself seeing that she has a knack for the job  while struggling to explain her love for the job and admiration for her gruffy boss to her way more conventional fianc MatthewRowling continues the pattern she set in the first Strike book The solution to the mystery unfolds slowly through the grunt of investigative work through long interviews with suspects through long treks on the streets of London with many false trails and red herrings guided by Strikes unerring sense and skill The mystery is slowmoving and lacks the easy gotcha moments hinged instead on character studies allowing the suspects to slowly reveal their inner selves full of shallow and sometimes quite dark unpleasantness propelled by almost casually shrewd observations of social inequalities and prejudices Every character short of almost idealized Strike and Robin  just for once can Cormoran Strike ever be wrong about anything gets the nottoopleasant but very apt treatment of Rowlings sharp characterization which makes them come alive even when youd rather them not The plotting is intricate the multiple plot strands so tightly woven together that its a pleasure to look back at the end of the story and see how they all were coming together And even the annoying turn in the last quarter of the book when Strike has solved the murder but the readers are kept waiting for the final reveal does not spoil the enjoyment of the storyAll in all I enjoyed this book quite a bit While not perfect it captures Rowlings talent as a storyteller and a master plotter quite well  stars Ill be quite happy to follow the adventures of Strike and Robin for quite some time    stars  SpoilersDisappointing it wasnt awful but it wasnt good either It was all rather predictable and generic I wouldnt have minded the cliches and obviousness of it all if the main characters Strike and Robin had stood out in some way Sadly they didnt I didnt care about either of them I actually kind of hated both I wasnt a fan of the writing there were a number of times where I came across sentences that didnt flow very well Some of the more difficult words seemed to be added in just to make the writing seem more impressive but it only ended up doing the oppositeThere was nothing actually impressive or genius about Strikes detective skills or intelligence the only reason he came across as half competent was because most of the people around him were completely thick I mean literally everybody on the police force were thickos Yea I could maybe buy a few of them being dim or lazy or something but not all of them Most police officers have years of experience and various trainingqualifications not to mention all of them have access to countless resources and other experts criminal psychologists and the like I very much doubt Strike could compete with that  so yea the only way to make his character come out on top and solve everything was by making everyone else dumb which was plain lazy writingI didnt like the heavy handed portrayal of Robin and Matthews relationship Its so obvious theyll end up splitting up because of Matthew not supporting Robins quest to be an investigator the amount of times he was shown as not understanding Robin or her work was ridiculous It kept cropping up over and over it was like Rowling was trying to make extra sure that her readers knew how unsuitable Robin and Matthew were for each other whilst simultaneously notsosubtly showing how us perfect Strike was for Robin and how he understood her Ugh it made for nauseating readingWhat was with Robin being all submissive and servantlike when it came to Strike Yea he was her boss but she went above and beyond her work duties She acted more like a downtrodden dutiful wife the way she fetched things for him and made him tea and coffee Of course Strike loved her meek submissive wifey behaviour and thought she was such a good little girl whenever she was quiet and did all his bidding Ugh it was all rather misogynistic and cringey It was laughable that so many beautiful and successful women like Nina kept throwing themselves at overweight hairy unsuccessful middle aged bland Strike Yea bloody right It was disgusting and off putting when Strike called Nina desperate and needy for wanting to sleep with him straight away Yet he didnt think any badly of himself for sleeping with her when he didnt even like her at least Nina slept with him because she for some reason fancied him Whereas he basically slept with her just because and as a thanks for the information she provided on his case though she didnt know that his behaviour was rather prostitutelike He had no right to be casting judgement on anyone else The prickThere were so many stereotypes of women they were either some variation of a Mary Sue or they were shallow desperate losers who threw themselves at Strike or were completely messed up None of the women came across as real peopleWhat was with all the female characters eatingdrinking things like soupssaladswater whist Strike was chugging down pints and having steak and chips It was irritating to read the females always eating such healthylittle food whilst Strike stuffed his face with all sorts Has Rowling never met any women who eats takeaways or desserts or somethingI actually think I would have enjoyed reading Bombyx Mori the much talked about manuscript in the book more than this  it sounded wonderfully bonkersI did really love some of the side characters they were infinitely more interesting than Strike and Robin I also enjoyed the setting and descriptions of London  it was captured really well All in all this was just a run of the mill mystery novel  the main characters were so blah and it was obvious who the bad guy was as soon as they were introduced Yea I expected more from Rowling   The Silkworm is the tenth JK Rowling novel Ive read I believe that after ten often gargantuan novels I can make fairly accurate generalizations about her writing And it saddens me to say that she keeps making the same mistakesMost glaring is her treatment of female characters In the Cormoran Strike mystery series we have another female character of much greater intrigue shunted to the side in favor of a male protagonist aka Hermione Granger Syndrome Robin is Strikes young personal assistant who could definitely contribute to mystery solving but mostly answers phones schedules appointments makes coffee and provokes male gazing The thing is Robin is much more fascinating to me than Strike Robin is desperate unsure diffident but ambitiousshe would have been a fabulous heroine for a detective series about a woman trying to break into a traditionally male profession Strike on the other hand does not interest me as a protagonist hes arrogant and infallible sorta reminds you of a character whose name rhymes with Barry Lotter non meaning that whenever Strike eliminates a suspect from contention I know him to be absolutely right simply because JK Rowling writes Strike in a way that he is always right For all of Rowlings characterization skills Strike is lacking He has a cool backstorymissing leg missing rockstar fatherbut none of it manifests itself in his psyche or quotidian actions They are just things we know about him like oh hey thats Cormoran Strike he lost his leg in Afghanistan and his dad is a famous guitarist In general I find JK Rowlings characterization maddeningly brilliant Shes super into the physicality of her characters In The Silkworm the first few chapters serve no other purpose than to introduce the storys players But we are told who these people are with special emphasis on their attractiveness and oneword descriptors hes the ambitious one and shes the daffy one Rowling is an expert at character portraits but you can only know the characters on her unique terms theres no room for personal interpretation Its as if she is this master dollmaker Each character is impeccably painted you can admire the surface details for hours but if you cracked the dolls open theyd be hollow Nothing murks beneath the detailed yet limited picture Rowling has painted us And yet shes a magnificent plotter a skill really wellsuited to the mystery genre which gives me hope for any subsequent installments though I will perpetually groan about Strikes usurpation of the protagonist role in lieu of Robin She carefully charts her reveals and includes tons of clever but useless information to throw you off Im not the biggest fan of how she writes climaxesthis isnt participatory mystery where you can solve alongside the detective you must wait for MindNumbingly Boring Detective Genius Cormoran Strike to figure it out and share his conclusions with youbut the underlying plot structure is solid Id just love to see her combine this knack for plot with deepened characters and themes Otherwise its forgettable    "},
{"title": "Beatrice and Virgil",

"author": "Yann Martel",
"text": "Fate takes many forms    When Henry receives a letter from an elderly taxidermist it poses a puzzle that he cannot resist As he is pulled further into the world of this strange and calculating man Henry becomes increasingly involved with the lives of a donkey and a howler monkeynamed Beatrice and Virgiland the epic journey they undertake togetherWith all the spirit and originality that made Life of Pi so beloved this brilliant new novel takes the reader on a haunting odyssey On the way Martel asks profound questions about life and art truth and deception responsibility and complicity I literally just finished Yann Martels new book Beatrice and Virgil BV for brevitys sake about  minutes ago I am shaken with rage as the book is one of the most hateful and ghastly jumble of horrors I have ever finished At least it is mercifully short In fact it is so short it can hardly be called more than just a long short story The main story clocks in under  pages there is tons of white space and the last  pages are games that feel lifted from works about the Holocaust ranging from Roman Polanskis The Pianist to Sophies Choice I read Life of Pi when it first came out and then again last week It will always stand as one of the best books of my reading life Beatrice and Virgil is a jumble a writer whos book has just been rejected a play that is occasionally exquisitely written that vibrates with beauty and life a comingtoterms with the Holocaust the revealing of a Nazi war criminal who somehow escaped detection who is allowed to live a silent life of peace a hungry donkey and the scream of a Howler monkey But what does it mean I dont know I think Mr Martel had terrible writers block after Pi the dreaded curse of the sophomore book even though Pi is really his second novel and he wants to write about the Holocaust in a new way But he overreaches And the book references waaaay too many other works of literature Many are mentioned by other reviewers and even Mr Martel quotes a story by Flaubert in long sentences so it is hard to really even hear Martels own voice BV reminds me so much of Ian McEwans The Comfort of Strangers in that it is so short has a bloody graphic ending that comes out of nowhere and takes place in an anonymous European city When it does shine through it is lovely especially early in the book read the  page description of a pear during the play that comes to him in bits and pieces by a struggling writer also with writers block clothed as a taxidermist Both protagonists are named Henry but usually the elder taxidermist is simply called the taxidermist His wife is immediately repulsed by him the waiters down the street treat him like a leper and he gives everyone except Henry extreme cases of the willies Henry sees brilliance in the taxidermists play and wants to shepherd it But the terse oblique removed and socially awkward taxidermist is afraid that Henry will steal his material and as a reader the deeper we got into the play the less I wanted to see it In Pi we are caught up in moments of graphic animal violence but it makes sense within that story and is balanced out by deep insights into spirituality In BV the graphic animal violence does nothing to serve the story except to try to give a new voice to the Holocaust and it simply doesnt work I dont want or need Martel to write a Pi sequel But this book is so abstract and cluttered with images that it feels like Martel cut up a bunch of better books on the subject threw the pieces up in the air gathered them up in random order added a hungry donkey and a monkey who howls and barfed them out in novella form In the end BV was gigantic disappointment for me Maybe I should try to digest the book before immediately reviewing it but I need a shower because it made me feel dirty  starsUPDATE This review has generated a lot of comments and I have actually bonded with some members of GoodReads over this review you know who you are As you may tell from my statements I was horribly disappointed with this book But I finished it weeks ago and I saw Yann Martel speak on  I just want to put this entire episode out of my mind forever I had prepurchased  copies one for me to have signed by the author I so admired to keep forever and one to sell in a few years if hopefullyat the time it won a few awards I have made book investments like that before and they have paid off I had a leather bound reissue of Bluebeard by Vonnegut that was signed and  weeks after his death I got  for it I have some first edition Philip Roth signed books and a few others Because I despised BV SO much I actually took the books back even though I had read one of them It took me less than  days to read it and I took the dust jacket off and handled it with such care that it could have be resold as totally new I feel Karma nipping at my heels because I have NEVER in my life taken back a book that I actually read and requested my money back I dont like the way it feels and I have to live with that in my mind and now out on GoodReads forever And my investment is also goneI lately found out that I can give a book ZERO out of  stars so I changed my review to reflect that Art is so subjective some people will look at a John Crapper toilet at the Smithsonian and say ART and others will say GARBAGE and they are BOTH right What is the effing point of getting into an argument how someone feels about a book Is this not why sites like this exist They exist SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS Not to fight So with the exception of Douglass who I sent a private message to contact me outside of this discussion Please contact me I have to divorce myself from this particular thread Im exhausted from being attacked sucked back in being asked questions I cannot answer and mostly having to think about this horrible mess of a book again and again and again NEW UPDATE I just found out that you cannot give zero starsGR counts it as unrated Even though I still despise this book Ill give it one star but only under protest   Its hard to review this book I loved the first part so much the simplicity and innocence of it It was so seemingly transparent and human and honest Then it turned it didnt become something else it revealed what it had been all alongIve read reviews with people saying they felt manipulated conned tricked They are expressing anger over the book and the way it approached the subject and who it was approached by Who is HE to be writing so offensively about the HolocaustThe symbolism in the book is too loud and too abundant to make any real sense of I first thought to describe it as walking around in a dry dusty overly warm shop with too many odd and confusing things on display for a mind to process but every time you turn to collect your thoughts to try to analyze one symbol you cant help but have another already in your face I disregarded that image because I found I was describing the taxidermy shop and didnt want to be using one symbol to describe the way his symbolism was to the sensesThen I thought of it as someone singing in an echo chamber They keep singing even though the song is just echoing all around so you cant hear the words or follow the melody since it keeps reverberating back at you again and again changing the song into something unbearable But that reminded me too much of the noise of the howler monkey Virgil In the end I decided to not try to decipher the symbolism to describe it at all I will just go ahead and describe how I felt after reading this book whether its what Martel intended or notI felt traumatized The book was a traumatizing experience I think thats why so many people reacted with such anger It was a hurtful manipulating offensive book But given the context and the forewarning I think thats what it was supposed to be It was as I see it anyway the flip book that Henry tried to get published The first part was the essay with the author setting his premise and the second part was the book of fiction going at the topic from a different way And again I dont know whether this was Martels intention but for me feeling overwhelmed and confused and overall traumatized is what someone should feel after reading about the Holocaust The book evoked the emotion of it created the residue of the aftermath one critic said she needed a shower after reading it because she felt dirty the trembling feeling of powerlessness It did an excellent job of making its reader feel victimized giving readers a hint of the idea of what its like so that it wont be forgotten The symbolism in the book is too hard to pick apart piece by piece Theres just too much of it and it overlaps and interwinds and is just another layer of being assaulted in itself But there were two things that really stood out for me as I was readingFirst off the fact that Henry the Taxidermist would never let Henry the author read the play himself but rather read it aloud to him The first time he did this I bristled I cannot stand for someone to ask my opinion of something and then read it to me I have to read the words with my own eyes This continued throughout the book with Henry the author finally commenting To read on ones own and to be read to are two very different experiences Not being in control of the words submitted to his attention unable to establish his own pace but rather dangling along like a prisoner in a chain gang he found that his level of attention and retention had variedThe issue of control here and mentioned again in the scene at the cafe when Henry the Taxidermist reads aloud to Henry the author again causing him to think Even here in public he was going to read aloud What a control freakIt lets us know that were not in control here The suffocating prickly feeling of things spinning away from us should have started up the survival senses alerting us that were in a trap here followed up immediately with my favorite observation of the whole book You dont like people do you Henry said which he meant lightlyThe taxidermist looked at the passerby for another moment then turned his gaze onto Henryand it was a pinpoint of concentration wholly focussed on him animallike in its intensity exactly that animallike As the taxidermist bore into him with his steady eyes a single thought occurred to Henry I am peopleIt wasnt a fun read It was traumatizing I wasnt offended by someone not personally touched by the Holocaust writing the book as some other people were I felt it appropriate in what he was sayingthat it affected all of us and will continue to touch us and hurt all of us forever you cant be removed from it by time and proximity its something that each of us carries with us because were human and share the history of being humanAt least thats what I got out of it   My first reaction was a howl a braying if you will into the vastness Martel does not allow us to look away He puts his everyman in charge of his own story and it is not a pretty sight Echoing great voices in literature through the centuries Martel chooses elements from many to create a symbolically dense but figuratively simple narrative in which a taxidermist lovingly recreates the beauty once inherent in animals now long dead Killednay massacred defaced defiled tortured and humiliatedbut killed make no mistake by everyman The simple language the brave humor the loving touch and gentle conversation between two doomed creatures who have seen much and suffered more elicits a moan of pain sadness and regret It takes a brave man to take on the big questions Martel clearly studied the greatsthose classic works of literature art and music handed down through the centuriesto see what links them to us now Dantes    shows us man much as he is this very dayno better no worse Becketts deceptively simple dialog in    Shakespeares complexities in    Prousts sensual descriptions in    are all reflected refracted through Martels lens He primes us with the bright fractured landscapes of Chagall and the heartstopping chords of Mozart and onward he leads us clueless Hamlets to view with him the world we lived in live in now a world we create anew each day Trivial is not a word I would use to describe this book Anguished is more the word I would choose That animals speak for us with us to us makes us search anew for meaning That the Horrors stands in for the Holocaust makes neither less potent That man is as he is is no less clear And you fair critic Dare you walk in the footsteps of the greats Dare you take on the challenge of making art not war Show us your colorsLater now I find myself still plumbing the depths of this horror In describing it to a friend I call it puzzling and disturbing and that it does not really succeed as a straightforward story One always has a brooding sense of doom and of something much darker meant by an otherwise ordinary reference Why does he choose a twofingered hand jesture for his sewing kit list Why does Virgil have a soliloquy of just one long sentence What is the meaning of his sic onelongword evilivingroomanerroneously Why Why Why   I think this book now holds the dubious honor of the worst book I have ever finished Its derivative dull  pretentious The story within the storya play featuring Beatrice and Virgil a monkey and donkey walking across a striped shirtis a cheap ripoff of Waiting for Godot There are other plot points involving the narrator Henrys pets that seem to come from nowhere and lead nowhere Finally the book ends with a series of philosophical questions that strive to be profound but remind me of nothing more than Homer Simpsons musing on whether Jesus could microwave a burrito so hot that he himself could not eat itI loved Life of Pi but I cant imagine ever reading Yann Martel again after this   You know those people who get put off by a book sheerly because of how popular it is and get it in their head that it sounds boring the blurb gave it a selfhelpfictionish tinge and I loathe selfhelp and is bound to be mainstream cause so many people are reading it Yeah Im one of those I saw people everywhere reading Life of Pi for a couple of years before I caved and read it  and I have to use a clich here I was blown away by how fantastic it was If you havent read it I hope you do Dont read any reviews or get any opinions first just read itSince the Life of Pi mania good on im too Canadian author and all weve all been eagerly anticipating his next book Martel felt it too He takes an ironic poke at our expectations and his possible failings as an author at the very beginning of Beatrice  Virgil which starts off with a writer Henry no doubt loosely based on Martel himself who after phenomenal success with his first novel takes five years to write a second about the Holocaust only to have his publishers knock it down flatWith his wife Susan a nurse they pack up and move to another city Henry doesnt try write a new book but picks up a job in a chocolate caf and joins an amateur theatre group But he still receives fan mail from all over the world and one letter changes everythingIts a letter from a man also called Henry  or rather its not a letter but a photocopy of an old Flaubert short story called The Legend of SaintJulian the Hospitaller and a scene from a play in which two characters called Beatrice and Virgil discuss the beauty and magnificence of a pear A handwritten note is included simply asking for Henrys helpHenry is perplexed unsure what the two manuscripts have in common or what kind of help hes being asked for though he assumes its the writerly kind Coincidentally the address is only a few streets away so Henry decides to walk his perfunctory reply over It turns out to be a taxidermy full of incredible stuffed animals and animal skulls The taxidermist is a highly unusual man and quite alienating inspired by a stuffed donkey and the stuffed howler monkey that sits on her back his characters are a donkey and a monkey The two animals live on a shirt  a striped shirt  and talk about what to do nextAs Beatrice and Virgils story reveals itself piecemeal Henry gets closer and closer to the truth about the taxidermist Its a truth that will quietly explode in his face and change him foreverThis is most likely not the story you would have expected or at least its tone and style is not When I started it I had no idea where it was going and so let myself drift on its words taken where it willed This usually pays off and it did here too This is a book you dont want to overthink but let quietly stew in your mind for a bit and just feel If you try to stop thinking as you read youll find the story can live and breathe in your head and take you to a deep dark place If nothing else Martel is a delightfully subtle and absorbing writerIts written in a style I dont know the word for heavily thirdperson very omniscient but sharing only what it wants to giving us only one perspective Henrys and a strangely limited one at that yet revealing much Its very narrative almost like theres a voiceover narrator as in movies like Stranger Than Fiction Like this One day he saw a sign posted in a window HELP WANTED On impulse he inquired Henry didnt need a job in fact he couldnt work legally but he liked the people at The Chocolate Road and he admired their principles He applied they were intrigued they agreed that he would be paid in shares and lo Henry became a small shareholder in a chocolate concern and a parttime waiter and general helper ppThis calm studied style is intercepted by excerpts  bits of the short story scenes from the taxidermists play and Games for Gustav at the end Its not just the style the voice that makes this novel truly unique I could never get it muddled in my head with any other story but the characters tooBeatrice the donkey and Virgil the howler monkey are two characters you wont be able to forget in a hurry I finished this book nearly a week ago and theyre still alive and fresh in my head Considering how lacklustre Henry is and how unpersonable the taxidermist is Beatrice and Virgil really are the main characters here Its interesting how they serve two purposes The taxidermist whose past I wont reveal for it would spoil the story is writing his play ostensibly to draw attention to needless animal cruelty to the destruction of their natural habitats their homelessness Their entire situation is an allegory for something else and yet even if it werent its still highly relevant That struck me quite a bit actually The parallels the way we treat animals  the way we treat humans like we treat animalsThere was much here that I admired that deeply impressed me not to mention the tragic story of Beatrice and Virgil and how towards the end it made me cry But I confess I didnt love it as much as I did his previous book Its not that its largely uneventful It might not be actionpacked or highly dramatic I dont care for that I think it comes down to the style its written in Even though it fits the story perfectly  I dont know that it could have been written any other way and still have the same impact  its not a style that sits comfortably with me Even while Im drawn into the story theres a part of me thats sitting outside of it cold and alone and pushed away I guess when it comes down to it writing being an art form theres some pain in good art Good art should make you at least a bit uncomfortable because if it is it will make you think Its also a very clever book without being at all pretentious or slick The apparent simplicity of the narrative voice gives it humility but its not an easy style to master If nothing else Martel has proven he can really writeThats not what I think of though I think of Beatrice and Vigril and their homelessness their list their love for each other their sacrifices And I bleed just a little bit for them for all of them I get the same tinge from books like Five People You Meet in Heaven and    Its probably unjustified but they seem to me to be books that are meant to be uplifting and all that Selfindulgent I say Ugh Youll never see me reading them Yes I know but I draw the line somewhere You can read it for free online here   "},

"author": "Anne Frank",
"text": "Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life Anne Franks remarkable diary has since become a world classica powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spiritIn  with Nazis occupying Holland a thirteenyearold Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding For the next two years until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo they and another family lived cloistered in the Secret Annexe of an old office building Cut off from the outside world they faced hunger boredom the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters and the everpresent threat of discovery and deathIn her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period By turns thoughtful moving and amusing her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling selfportrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short My intention of writing a review for this book is to tell all the negative reviewers to SHUT UP I am all for everyones right to express their opinion but I read a few of the  star reviews and I was shocked to read what a few people had to say about this book Before making an opinion I suggest people to keep a few things in mind This is someones DIARY not a book meant to entertain people If you think it was boring then answer me how many interesting things can you possibly do locked up in a place for  years For those who comment on the writingThis is a year olds diary She didnt write it with the intention of winning the pulitzerFor those who commented on her ideologies or how nazism is portrayed Hello She was  And maybejust maybe its justified to think the way she does considering she LIVED it unlike so many of us who get to sit back on our comfortable sofas and critically analyze every XYZ thing in the worldI believe no one has the right to review much less criticize a written document of a  year olds life who made it through the worst of circumstances and through difficulties we cannot even imagine to live throughIts a pity some people think the way they doEDIT th Sept I never imagined I would garner so many likes for this review This only means that a lot of people are emotional about this book and take negative reviews as a personal insult I wrote this review in a very emotionally charged mind frame A year later now that I am older wiser and more mature I realise I could have used fewer exclamation marks P   Why do we write reviewsYou have a lot of reasons I guessBut for this review there is only one I am writing this for my conscience Ever since I have rated this book I always end up asking myself that have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy some call it pity voteReading other reviews although most people just rate it and proceed posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diarySo Im going to start withDO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diaryYes it is a diary not a book And arent diary meant to be something personal Yes they are but it was Annes wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing namesWhen I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesnt I had the least of the expectation knowing that she was  years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life She thought and wrote over few such things that didnt occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life She at times made me laugh at times made me feel sad If she felt something her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large marginI have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age Of course they were difficult conditions make you mature and responsible but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition the suffering had even effect on them I remember the letter exchange between two sisters at that point after reading Margots letter for the first time I realised Anne was still child among themSome say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her faultThe thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of themI have it in my mind but cant put it in words and why should I Does it matter what kind of girl was she NO from me Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresomeI liked it it couldnt get any better I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window they were not solving murder mystery I remember that when I was halfway through the book I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again feel the fresh wind and to go to school but This is not a book to enjoy much we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world No one has ever benefitted from war all it gives is pain and miseryAll this being said there is nothing to review the book but accept it as written account of the vices of the warThe worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old Would it have been famous as it is nowWell she didnt survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back   I confess to feeling slightly voyeuristic while reading this It was constantly in the back of my mind that this was no ordinary novel or even a truetolife account This was someones diary Every page written in confidence each word revealing the thoughts closest to the heart of this young girl As a journalkeeper myself I sometimes find myself wondering What if someone else were to read this which causes me to wonder how much to filter my words But then isnt the purpose of a diary or journal just the opposite To record ones honest and unfiltered thoughts While reading Anne Frank  The Diary of a Young Girl I do not get the sense that there is any such filtering going on From the ages of  Anne lived an extraordinary life and quickly grew far beyond her years in her understanding and handling of a horrendous situationThere are surprises in this book No matter how broad or limited your understanding of the world events that threw Anne and her family into a life in hiding I had  before reading this  held the general assumption that Well it was wartime They were in hiding for their lives They must have been miserable all the time Who could possibly find anything good or redeeming in the confines of such a life In hindsight of course I have had to reconsider I found bits of beauty kindness and even humour popping up in the most unexpected places And why shouldnt I Arent our lives much the same Oh  were not dodging bombs and trying to sleep to the sound of gunfire at least not in Canada But we each of us are often faced with some sort of tragedy or travesty Sometimes we may have an entire bad year or longer And yet doesnt the buoyancy of the human spirit always shine through It is really tough work to be miserable  hours a day No matter how difficult or challenged our daytoday life we all have those little pockets of joy that arise and sometimes it is those tiny occurrences that make the rest of it bearableOn a personal level I found myself comparing Annes childhood to that of my parents After all she was only a year younger than my Mom and Dad I think back to stories theyve told from their teen years and it boggles the mind to think that at the exact moment my Dad and his brothers were tipping a cow Anne was in hiding on the other side of the world At a time when my mother was discovering makeup Anne was realizing that life would never again be so youthful so joyous and carefree as before the war A generation was losing its innocence but in very different waysI would recommend Anne Frank  The Diary of a Young Girl to absolutely everyone for I believe that it holds some truth or enlightenment for everyone I do not own this copy  it was borrowed from my daughters school library She will be reading it next She is  And you can bet that before long I will purchase my own copy for I will be reading it again someday soon   Honestly I just cant do it I cant bring myself to finish the book Ive tried three times already and each time I have been forced to put it aside Books and film about the Holocaust are fascinating but not this one Unfortunately I was not engaged and found I couldnt care less Ill have to try it again in a few years On the up side I firmly believe that Anne Frank had she survived the war would have grown up to be a marvelous best selling writer At the age of  her words are better than that of many modern day famous authors     For her th birthday Anne Frank received a diary she dubbed Kitty Shortly after her birthday with the fear that her older sister Margo may be taken by the Nazis the Franks disappear into the night and go into hiding It is through Kitty that Anne records her thoughts and daily life living behind a bookcase in the secret annexWhen I was younger I went through a holocaust phase before moving on to Harriet Tubman and slavery The funny thing is that Anne Franks Diary was not the first Holocaust book I read I think that was The Devils Advocate AnywayI soon became fascinated by the Secret Annex and the secluded life she lived for two years Unfortunately she and the other occupants of the Annex were betrayed and sent to concentration camps with only her father Otto Frank surviving The tragic thing not to minimize the inhumanity of it all is that Anne died mere weeks before liberation Annes dream was to have her diary published after the war and after liberation her father saw that happen making Kitty a time capsule to an unfathomable past View all my reviews on my blog She is too fond of books   "},
{"title": "Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character",
"isbn": "0393316041",
"author": "Richard Feynman",
"text": "Richard Feynman  winner of the Nobel Prize in physics thrived on outrageous adventures Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets painting a naked female toreador  and much else of an eyebrowraising natureIn short here is Feynmans life in all its eccentric glory  a combustible mixture of high intelligence unlimited curiosity and raging chutzpah This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual fun way that makes it easy to read The problem is that the author NobelPrizewinning physicist Dick Feynman is annoying All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent using it delighting others or himself if thats his real goal and then being applauded for it sometimes only by himself For example he discovers that hes a great artist musician safecracker and critic Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk There were many times when I thought yeah buddy you think its funny but no one else does A few stories like this and its quirky but piled on top of each other its annoyingI cant really recommend this book Maybe mischevious selfaggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise I suggest a pass   This book was a pure delight The subtitle Adventures of a Curious Character is spoton Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life thought a series of storiesOne thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things You would think a worldfamous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics  but Feynman was curious about everything he saw He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun  the list goes on My take you should have your passions  but you should also have your hobbies I think I need a new hobby I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to I think this is not a unique problem in educationAnother lesson learned from Feynmans studies of science is to never take any data for granted Always always question the sources Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would regenerate many of the numbers on his own  even if they had been published in other places For many things we are and not just in science standing on the shoulders of giants The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist with real integrity And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles This book was a lighthearted attempt to point that out  not to mention a very entertaining read     The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynmans career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university The deans wife is serving and asks him the above question Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynmans life is that he had no time for formalisms rituals or societal views He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findingsIts no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist but he also had many interests And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in s Vegas theres a story about this time waiting for a showgirl to finish work He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton a drumming pal of Richards Yes Feynman played the bongos So while you have this brilliant man in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted there ares some hints that he is a man of his time Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in And so when someone from the twentyfirst century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life There are also a couple of great chapters on education one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region Id recommend this read to most people It is extremely accessible with little jargon or technical physics It talks more on his philosophy of living learning and how to deal with the world around you He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube Its great to know that we still have so much of him aroundAnd for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel   Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize Hes also a complete hoot The book is a series of autobiographical stories  pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos teaching himself to paint scientific discoveries he made his three marriages how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep hed imagine conversations with his foreignborn colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents  but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadnt This was entirely typical of Feynmans wide ranging curiosity and intelligence but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by thisWhat I love about Feynman  first of all his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment The great joy he found in working things through he said that the reason hed never tried drugs though he was tempted was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didnt want to risk that Also hes clearly so very intelligent and reading his book his thoughts seem so easy to follow  it makes the world of science seem accessible   You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be Its their mistake not my failing  Richard Feynman Surely Youre Joking Mr FeynmanIve been circling this book The Feynman Lectures on Physics and Glecks Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start I was driving from TaosSanta Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on FeynmanOften memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is faade A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose They want to be viewed as smart important funny etc They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life Richard Feynmans memoir is different Not that I dont think Feynman had an ego He might have even had an agenda with the book But for the most part he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell rather than on how they would make him look He wasnt all that worried about how he looked so much His entire life was built around doing what he wanted exploring what he found interesting violating taboos beating his own drums and cutting his own path He was a Nobelprize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums teaching drawing naked girls picking locks making atomic bombs practical jokes and telling stories He wasnt interested in the usual trappings of success Many of those things annoyed him He was curious He was a risktaker He was a genius   "},

full of children  When hes threatened by the sadistic Meehan brothers Fallon must agree to one last hit But this time theres a witness a priest named Father De Costa And when everyone else wants the Father dead Fallon is determined to protect him to earn redemption from his life of crime and forgiveness for the blood on his hands In the s when Higgins still taught adult education in Leeds and was clearly styling himself on Ted Lewis he wrote some brilliant books This was one of them It got me reading as a kid back in the days when I hated school and ran away to join the army at  Sadly when Higgins moved to Gurnsey and started supporting Margaret Thatcher he lost something One of the great things about a Prayer for the Dying apart from its interesting allusions to the writing style of Graham Greene and the fact its a BRILLIANT story is that it isnt populated by real figures in preposterous scenarios trotting out expositional dialogue  a sad trait of Higgins more recent novels    Over the course of five decades he has used many names Martin Fallon is just one of them He carries a huge load of guilt for the tragic errors of his past As a soldier for many years in the Irish Republican Army  the military force known as the Provos  he was responsible for an uncounted number of deaths Now Fallon is a mercenary of sorts a gun for hireA tale of violence and redemptionA Prayer for the Dying opens in the city of Hull in the north of England early in the s In hopes of securing a passport and the necessary funds to flee the country Fallon agrees to kill the chief rival of a local crime boss and he carries out the assignment with cold efficiency Theres just one hitch standing just feet away in the cemetery where the murder takes place a Catholic priest witnesses the act Thus begins an intriguing tale of violence guilt contrition and redemptionA crime boss a killer for hire and a confessionSix principal characters figure in this wellcrafted and suspenseful thriller all of them fully fleshedout and interesting in their own right Apart from Fallon they include the ruthless crime boss Dandy Jack Meehan and his sexcrazed younger brother Billy the priest Father Michael da Costa a former soldier in Britains Special Air Service a British special forces unit the priests blind niece Anna da Costa and DetectiveSuperintendent Miller the veteran cop who heads the Hull CID The fourway relationship among these characters revolves around the inviolability of the confession in the eyes of the ChurchAbout the authorJack Higgins is the favorite pseudonym of the bestselling English author Harry Patterson Though Patterson has written  novels in a career spanning six decades he is probably best known for two The Eagle Has Landed  and A Prayer for the Dying  Both were made into major motion pictures although nine other Patterson novels were tooA longer than usual author biography of Patterson appears at the end of the novel and includes a number of photos of the author at various stages of his life At this writing he is  years old Hes a fascinating man the equal of any of his characters   Probably my least favourite of Jack Higgins efforts and I have read just about all of them over the years I first read it as a teen and have read it again a couple of times since While the characters are exceedingly interesting I found them underdeveloped in places and overly simplified in others Such great opportunity for more depth went begging Higgins has a great formula and for a quick pageturning Sunday afternoon time waster it does the trick However it is a long way down my list of his work that I would recommend Always surprised me why this one is one of the few they have dramatised particularly when they did such a woeful job of it    This book was short but it was mighty ExIRA soldier using the name Martin Fallon is pushed into performing a contract hit on a very bad mobster by another very bad mobster in exchange for a new passport new identity and a trip on a ship out of England for a new life His soul carries wounds from an IRA bombing gone bad A priest witnesses his contract killing but Fallon cant bring himself to kill the priest even though he has seen his face What follows is a painful journey for Fallon and the characters affected by his actionsHiggins created characters that resonate and though the book was written many years ago those characters are true to life and the story has a timeless quality The writing is nearly flawless and though short this book carries the weight in your heart that a longer work would carry I finished it last night and havent been able to get the story out of my mind  now that is the mark a truly great work    stars Read this thriller by Jack Higgins years ago and its stood the test of time in my eyes Martin Fallon is an interesting character An executioner for the IRA he is haunted by a mistake that he will carry for the rest of his days Hes contracted by the thoroughly evil Jack Meehan to murder a rival in England for the price of a safe passage When the hit is witnessed by the local Catholic priest Michael da Costa their lives become intertwinedIts a fast flowing story violent in parts filled with strong characters but it was the softly spoken tortured Martin Fallon that made this a keeper for me Its somewhat dated now but still an excellent read   "},

Only they know Bournes true identity and understand the telegram is really a message from Bournes mortal enemy Carlos known also as the Jackal the worlds deadliest and most elusive terrorist And furthermore they know that the Jackal wants a final confrontation with Bourne Now David Webb professor of Oriental studies husband and father must do what he hoped he would never have to do again  assume the terrible identity of Jason Bourne His plan is simple to infiltrate the politically and economically Medusan group and use himself as bait to lure the cunning Jackal into a deadly trap  a trap from which only one of them will escapeFrom the Paperback edition After three grueling months I finally finished reading this book You may ask yourself If it was so grueling why did he finish it at all Good question After reading the first two books in the Bourne trilogy I felt compelled to finally see the final confrontation between Jason Bourne and Carlos the Jackal Now I will admit that The Bourne Ultimatum was not nearly as boring and convoluted as its predecessor The Bourne Supremacy However Im fairly certain that Robert Ludlum took a class on writing ridiculously bad exposition dialogue before completing the series The characters never say anything the least bit natural or believable in the entire book and every conversation seems to include one character saying to another Im not following you after which the speaker tediously explains their prior explanation about unexplained government conspiracies in an inexplicable fashion Hey Robertif your characters need the dialogue reexplained so that your reader will have the slightest clue what the hells going onmaybe its time to write better Of course Ludlums dead so we know he cant read this Just like I could barely read his book If the book had been about  pages shorter it would have at least been fastpaced and fun but at over  pages it was incredibly overblown and repetitive Its a real shame because I loved The Bourne Identity Without the mystery of who Jason Bourne is and why he knows how to be such an amazing superspy theres nothing to draw you into the story Stay away unless you are a hardcore Ludlum or spythriller fan   What can I say It was intense  a little too intense for me By about the middle of the book I wanted to shoot Carlos myself just so that the insanity would end The plot in this book seems even more complex than in the other two and is impossible to comprehend Nevertheless I cared about Jason Bourne enough as a character to stick out the whole grueling story with him but I felt almost as beat up and emotionally raw as he did by the time it was over Overall not a pleasant reading experience but if youre a diehard Bourne fan you cant really pass this one up    As the Ludlum portion of the Bourne series comes to an end with this book I must say that this is surely a very thick in all its senses book filled with great nuances Completing the original trilogy at a time when spy games were all about actual deception and sleight of hand rather than technology and the information highway makes these books stand out for me That said Ludlum is as he is accused of being overly verbose in some areas and really could have watered down the description and yet still come out with a great book While Bourne comes up against his greatest nemesis yet the famed Carlos the Jackal the book has the reader traipsing all over the place to ensure the Bourne family is safe and then hunting the Jackal until he can be found The excitement near the end made up for sections of very slow reading and kept me from putting it down While I admire Ludlum for his creativity it was at times a little too muchLudlums classics do portray Jason BourneDavid Webb in a certain way that will surely be hard to replicate in an era when technology is the key to the game Eric Lustbader the author who has taken over the series will surely be placed in some large shoes and it is now up to the reader to determine how well they are filled That said if we are to be realistic here Bourne was around  years old when this book took place set in  so he is surely aging over that time I suppose we shall see if the reader must suspend reality and allow Bourne not to age over the  year hiatus or whether Lustbader will pick up in the early s surely harder to do with technology being what it is in the espionage game these daysOne small thing I must mention in this book being a proud Canadian I picked up on Ludlums continual use of Mrs Webb Marie in all three books as being part of the Canadian Government She is in Book  from Ontario and lived on a farm In Book  she magically was growing up in the farming communities of Saskatchewan yet was still a Francophone Those who know their Canadian even Prairies geography will see the issue Then in this book we are back to tossing hay in Ontario Keep those things clear as there is surely a group of us who can tell and do pay attentionI must admit the use of numerous languages does bring the book alive The French is accurate and I can only assume that the German and Russian is also up to par Makes the reader feel as though we are actually IN these places that are being discussed There my asides are completeKudos Mr Ludlum and thank you for setting the foundation for a great series I do wonder if Lustbader will Hollywoodise your work from now on That said I am eager to dive in to see how the postLudlum BourneWebb holds up   To be honest I was disappointed with this one I felt like finishing it  and the original trilogy  was an obligation after only a few pagesThe dialogue is ridiculous  nobody and while Im not familiar with American government institutions and their employees Im pretty sure this covers them too speaks in such a manner Every conversation is overly convoluted and then  as if for the sake of an uneducated audience  explained again as part of the same dialogue Not only that but the way in which the characters speak to eachother with regard to their feelings toward the other I used the word ridiculous already but it appliesThe plot isnt too bad Its actually something that could make a really good novel  revenge mixed in with international conspiracy and psychological trauma was indeed the stuff that made the first two novels bloody good reads However when you mix in the poor dialogue and easy fixes seriously everything that could be a problem from CIA equipment millions of dollars in funds incognito international travel is so easily sorted out and available it just lacks anything resembling substance The Bourne character  really the only reason I stuck with it to see its original conclusion  has sadly become a poor imitation of itself in this book Predictable trite and frankly a bit of a let down A shame a real shame    My rating is perhaps a little unusual for meas its not really based on literary merit Indeed I found myself upon this reread a little shocked at how often Bourne makes mistakes and is mentioned to be getting old Still its one of the first adult novels I really read and got into and for that it has a special place in my heart William Dufriss narration of this work so enthralled me at the time that I played the tapes several times over  no small thing considering they ran for over twentyfive hours and even reading it myself now I find I hear his voice and his charactersI especially liked the way Ultimatum made homage to Identity the section back in France was very nicely done if a little rushed And again I can only further iterate that the way Bournes age is brought up time and again makes the subsequent novels even more pointless than many have intimated The final sentence of the novel ends the trilogy perfectly and as far as Im concerned thats how the series should have remained   "},

master sniper decides to hone his sniping abilities by taking a little target practice at the remaining laborers in his own prison camp But one man escapes and becomes the key to solving the mystery of the cold calculating Kommandmant Repp and his plans for ending the warRepp was the master sniper whose deadly talent had come to the notice of British Intelligence as the linchpin of a desperate Nazi plot to reverse the fortunes of the Third Reich at the eleventh hour But what was the nature of the weapon that Repp was to aimand who was to be his last target Allied Intelligence officers Leets from the US and Outhwaite from England are dispatched to identify and abort his lethal mission And when they finally learn the truth the Second World Wars deadliest race against time is on A good read that could have been better The plot was excellent with enough wrinkles and surprises to maintain the tension There was also more than a dash of technology which I always like in any novel What I found lacking was a more rounded understanding of the characters particularly the sniper Why did he think as he did How did he become such a blinded nonthinking Nazi These are questions I hope to explore in the novel I am currently writing and I was disappointed not to get Hunters view   I liked this better than the last book of his I read Havana but not as well as the first Bob Lee Swagger book This has nothing to do with the Swagger characters that I could see Just a straight WWII yarn The narrative is d person  from basically  separate POVs a German snipers  an American Intelligence man who is tracking him I found the snipers thought processes pretty well done  scarily so His dedication hatred  motivations seemed very real Surprisingly I didnt feel that way about the good guys I dont think they were as well portrayed Hemingway makes another caricature appearance Hunter doesnt seem to like him much There was a lot of good action some of it surprising some sickening all of it fairly realistic It portrays the last days of the war pretty well I think Im no expert but it seemed right to me All in all it was an OK read but I dont think Ill bother again Id give it  stars   Stephen Hunters first novel from  His capability as a writer to portray events and people in a very firstperson you are there fashion is well above average His sentence grammar is also well above the norm for action or war and suspense novelsThis book had a very dark overtone With its focus on so many details of individual fighting action and on the topics of death camps at the end of WW it was not a pleasant leisurely read It was also very different from the shootemup video game type of action sequence novels so often seen today The writing has a very realistic earthy feelTheres a great deal of shooting detail which is accompanied by the blood and stench of dead bodies This book does not have an objective of attempting to glamorize snipers or localized firefightsOn the downside I felt that the German shooter operated too efficiently with far fewer setbacks than what might realistically be expected The only shortcoming came on the last  pages with the lead filled rifling in his rifle barrel I think that even a good shooter much less a top class sniper would have known of this possibility and seen the result in testing For example in a  shot sequence there should have been some misses as the fouling accumulated Yet the only person who seemed to be aware of this was the gun engineerdesigner who was killed before being able to report the condition Because of the barrel rifling and soft ammo the problem would have been consistent across tests of which there were several and everyone familiar with firearms should have been aware and checking for the problem In the case of the book overlooking the issue allowed the hero and sidekick goodguys to unexpectedly live to close their chase in the last few paragraphs after the reader was led to believe that they had been eliminated and failed   Let me put it bluntly  author had a great idea when he came up with the story for this book and then he completely failed in the execution of that idea You have all the components for a great story here  the mystique of snipers one last mission at the end of WWII and human hunt for a very clever and dangerous individual In a way the premise of the book strongly reminds of the classic Day of the Jackal only in different settingHowever Stephen Hunter doesnt come even close to the classic of Frederic Forsythe His characters are dull and never awoke my interest Secondary plots that are intended to bring them to life are pretty pointless some of them can even be described as pure filler text because they have nothing to do with main plot The worst thing however is that even the main event isnt very interesting and I doubt that anybody would notice it if it had happened for realSo basically its a quite disappointing book Luckily Stephen Hunter gets much better in his later efforts  I would for example strongly recommend Point of Impact to any reader that likes technothrillers and snipers as a plot device But if youll give Master Sniper a pass then you wont be missing on much   Although Ive been reading Hunters film reviews in my local paper for years Ive never picked up any of his books However I have a soft spot for WWIIbased thrillers so when I stumbled across this first book of Hunters originally published in  I figured Id give it a whirl Set in the waning weeks of the war in Europe the story concerns a topsecret Nazi plan to use their top sniper and a special weapon to eliminate a mysterious target Meanwhile an OSS smallarms analyst in London is given a scrap of information to check out a tiny thread that he cant stop pulling on which slowly but surely puts him on the trail of the German plot The book then follows a fairly conventional thriller trope as the Allied team races against the clock to stop the Nazis before its too lateThe resulting narrative has the unevenness you might expect from a first novel Some sequences are quite good and some are really flat some characters are decent developed others are stiff For example the description of the battle in Russia that turned the German sniper into a hero is outstanding But there is an extended section in the middle about an exhibition tennis match one of the supporting characters in involved in which has nothing to do with anything Parts of it are wildly over sentimentlized while others are distinctly coldblooded The plot also relies entirely upon a ridiculous coincidence which brings the American analyst into contact with the one person who can provide him with several crucial pieces of information Another big disappointment is the revelation of the target for this elaborate plot which left me entirely underwhelmed On the whole I suppose its a serviceable WWIIthriller but nothing worth seeking out unless youre a fan of the genre It does have enough bright parts to make me interested in checking out one of Hunters later books to see if hes ironed out the wrinkles in his writingNote The secret weapon at the heart of the story is basically an infrared nightvision device heavily based on the real Zielgeraet system developed for the Sturmgewehr  assault rifle and really deployed sometime in late  early    "},

"text": "In Zurich Switzerland American investment banker Ben Hartman has arrived on holiday when he chances upon old friend Jimmy Cavanaugh  a madman whos armed and programmed to assassinate In a matter of minutes six innocent bystanders  and Cavanaugh  are dead But when his body vanishes and his weapon mysteriously appears in Hartmans luggage Hartman is plunged into an unfathomable nightmare and suddenly finds himself on the run Meanwhile in Washington DC Anna Navarro field agent for the Department of justice has been asked to investigate the sudden  seemingly unrelated  deaths of eleven men throughout the world The only thing that connects them is a secret file over a halfcentury old linked to the CIA and marked with the same puzzling codename SigmaBut as Anna follows the connecting thread she finds herself in the shadows of a relentless killer who is one step ahead of her victim by victim Together she and Hartman must uncover the diabolical secrets long held behind the codename Sigma It will threaten everything they think they know about themselves and confirm their very worst fears This is my nth Robert Ludlum book but unlike those that Ive so far read this surprised me the most Why Its backdrop is the Holocaust And for those who know me or those who regularly read my reviews Holocaust novels have never fail to touch choose one grip wretch warm my heartWhat will you do if the Jewish father that you loved all your life and who people respected and pitied because he claimed to be a Holocaust survivor was in fact a Nazi torturer And you found out this ugly incomprehensible truth only now that he is already deadThis is the basic premise of the book Something that could have win him a Nobel like Wiesel Kertesz Agnon etcHowever this is a Robert Ludlum book This is said to be the last one what he wrote himself and completed before he died So there must be the Robert Ludlum ingredients One there has to be a secret powerful worldwide organization and yes you guessed it right it is called Sigma see the title and it is an organization founded during the last year of Nazis existence The group however is still operating nowadays and it is composed of the rich and famous people around the globe It controls the world economy and can influence presidential elections in many big countriesThen there has to be two agents a man and a woman who you think will fall in love because they are cute together This time they are Ben Hartman the surviving son of the dead father and US DoJ agent Anna Navarro They are both haunted by the Sigma tentacles so they run together in their quest to find out the truth about the organizationThe last quarter of the book is totally unexpected They went to the Austria Alps and found something sinister there that will totally make you wonder and regret why Robert Ludlum did not pass on his wallless imagination to the current herd of mysterythriller writers He was just one of a kind in terms of concocting books belonging to this genreI hope the Robert Ludlum estate continue to write and write books that are reflective of Ludlums intricate plots like this one   Well though theres a woman Anna Vavarro who works for US Intelligence its not really a spy novel though theres a wealthy businessman Ben Hartman its not a legalmoney laundering novel though theres a background of international intrigue its not simply about world domination as those whore following global governmental revelations would expect Its a simple murder mystery that uses the main themes as a backdrop nothing elseBut with a catch Motive There is none Until and its like the world we know is shrouded by the world we can never be allowed to know The Sigma Protocol is a pageturning dream of a read Ludlums books are so good because he just wrote crumbling ropebridge fiction and REALLY enjoyed what he was doing I blogd about my second reading of this novel this morning with specific reference to the eponymous Sigma SG of the title  httpmikephilbinblogspotcom   Yeah Ludlum is a famous author And I loved The Eiger Sanction when I read it as a teenager I know its genre fiction but I love a good escape so I thought Id give Robert Ludlum another tryI suppose its what its supposed to be fastpaced easy reading But I was expecting more Its not a total waste it must have been a lot of work to put together that many pages But come on its just not fair for a guy to get that rich for such basically mediocre writing and plotting Let me kvetch about three thingsMistakes If youre making that much money and getting that big an advance you owe it to your readers to get the basics right The publisher should be embarrassed at their own copyediting but given that many publishers dont do squat it falls to the author And if your characters are jetsetting all over Europe and the Americas  a lot of readers will have been there and  checking it out is taxdeductible So theres no excuse For example a sign in a French police station reads DFENCE DE FUMER Honestly Such things erode our confidence and make us suspect all sorts of geographical temporal and linguistic lazinessBranddropping Many of the characters are obscenely rich There is a fascination with these things and great wealth gives characters a plausible excuse to have access to specialized knowledge and cool stuff like private jets But please we dont need to be told at every turn that character xyz has a beautifullytailored gray pinstripe bespoke Savile Row suit or an Herms scarf or Volant Ti Super skisnone of which have any bearing on the plot except to tell us that the owner is tasteful and rich enough to afford it In Legally Blonde knowledge of clothes and accessories is part of the plot when you do not reach the standard of that screenplay youre in troublePlot Grandiosity I have complained about this before elsewhere Its a bee in my bonnet And of course all of these things are matters of taste But one of the things that makes say John LeCarrs works so terrific is that what the spies spy about never really amounts to much Its important to them but the Earth never quite moves Here well no spoilers but the stakes are very high indeed Ridiculously high To give Ludlum credit he does bring interesting moral dilemmas into play but they get buried rather than resolved    I first read a Robert Ludlum novel after watching The Bourne Identity movie I started with the Bourne series of books and was hooked If youre into thrillers I would encourage you to read those booksTHE SIGMA PROTOCOL is a stand alone story and has a captivating beginning as all thrillers should placing the hero in an untenable position right from the start From there things only get worse for the hero Trying to determine who the good guys and bad guys are is part of the fun for the readerLudlum does an excellent job of making you want to stay up a few minutes more at night to read the next chapter just to see how the latest wrinkle will unfold in the storyIf you like thrillers I think youll like this book   I didnt care for this Ludlum book as much as other ones I originally got hooked on Ludlum by reading his CovertOne novels The Sigma Protocol started out good grabbing my attention and pulling me in but I dont think the characters were realistic or compelling I also found the whole thing to be a bit of a stretch The biggest conspiracy in the history of the world is just a bit too much for me to swallowI will keep reading Ludlum my next book is the Bourne Identity I love the movies I will enjoy reading about a character who can handle himself in any situation   "},

contient que de vieux vtements tachs de sang  The Hanged Man of SaintPholien also published as Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets  begins with Detective Chief Inspector Jules Maigret following a French suspect in Germany one who commits suicide within the first few pages Maigret immediately realizes that without meaning to he has caused a certain Louis Genet to shoot himself in the mouth This terrible turn of event leads Maigret to try to discover more about this Louis Genet  who turns out to be traveling under an assumed name As Maigret tries to find out this mans real identity he stumbles onto a bigger  and older  crime To say more would be to ruin the mystery but let me say that of the four Georges Simenon novels Ive read this is the most unusual and the best The novel really shows Maigret as the unique officer of the law that he is Highly recommended    On a train journey Inspector Maigret espies a shifty nervous young man guarding a battered old suitcase with odd intensity Maigret judges the man suspicious and so follows him then at an opportune moment lets a strange curiosity gets the better of him and switches the mans suitcase for a lookalike Later though he witnesses the man open the new case and be so horrified by what he finds  or what he doesnt find  that he immediately blows his brains out But when Maigret opens the real case he finds that it contains nothing valuable at all just a stained old suitMaigret begins to investigate But this isnt a case where the Inspector is called in to meet a strange new crime but one loaded with guilt as Maigret tries to find out just how responsible he is for this deathThis isnt so much a whodunit then as a what the hell is going on crime novel The Inspector swiftly comes across a group of men who are connected to the deceased and are obviously covering up But what are they covering up And why is it so important that Maigret now finds his life in dangerObviously this is the kind of mystery which only exists in crime fiction No police force on either side of The Channel is going to hold their hands up to ever having a case like this But the lack of realism or the fact that its all building up to a stagey revelation scene doesnt impact how hard this novel hits Yes theres a huge amount of artifice but it feels like theres a real humanity at stake here So by the end were not just looking at the denouement as we sometimes do with Ms Sayers or Ms Christie for how cleverly the author has deployed the red herrings but actually feeling real human emotions and a surfeit of compassion Its crime fiction but its not crime fiction just about death  its about regrets and escaping your past and making sure that your kids are raised properly Its about people and its all the more powerful for it   Georges Simenon is the antidote to all those fussy little mysteries where everything is so clearcut and all the detective has to do is waltz between a few suspects until he or she finds the guilty party in a final dash of brilliance No there is a kind of Gallic fog about Simenons Inspector Maigret Maigret is French to a fault We start out Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets with a few very discordant facts and very little idea of whether a crime was committed or if so the nature of that crimeA poor unemployed workingman travels to Bremen with a cheap suitcaseOn a hunch Maigret follows him and at the station out of a sense of playfulness trades suitcases he has an identical oneWhen he finds out that the suitcases have been exchanged the workingman commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a revolverWhat was in the traded suitcase Nothing but an old suit with bloodstains on itThere are four or five men who seem to come together at odd times when Maigret is around and they are obviously very put out with Maigrets involvement What does this French cop know Is he on to usAnd so it goes until Maigret discovers the facts of the case by a process known in French as dbrouiller or cutting through the fog This case like so many of Maigrets is clearly wrapped in some obscuring mists It is Maigrets stolidity and persistence which sees him through the smoke despite two murder attempts on him and outlasting his adversaries when he doesnt even know why they are his adversariesI love reading Simenons mysteries and this is one of his good early ones    When I lived in Neuchatel Switzerland for a couple of years while in high school I fell in love with Inspector Maigret and read most of the series in French My French being worse than dormant in my dotage I have been pleased to see the release of the Maigret stories for my Kindle and have added several Hanged Man was the fourth of the series Unlike most of the subsequent books its less a police procedural as technically he doesnt even has a case and more of a psychological novel resembling his nonMaigret stories Here Maigret has been traveling and watching a man senses something peculiar in his behavior He follows the man who then commits suicide This leads Maigret to pursue assorted leads in order to understand the motivation behind the mans suicide I wont give away more except to say the book is an interesting examination of guiltMaigret is such an interesting character He can adopt a multitude of persona from the bumbling ignoramus to the brilliant and insightful detective while being compassionate or cruel as the situation demands   An early Maigret that doesnt disappoint Simenon himself was a bit of an enigma and the way he writes Maigret in these early books probably tells you a lot more about how Simenon saw himself than it does about the man who would go on to star in over  detective novels And no more so than this highly enjoyable readThis is probably as much of a psychological study as Simenon could make his Maigret novels unlike his other work his roman durs Jules Maigret inhabits the lighter side of Simenons literature and whilst theres always somebody meeting a grizzly end and people behaving in a seemingly reprehensible manner these books are more often found to be almost lighthearted and populated by oddball characters the least of which is the charming often aloof always drinking and eating something delicious Chief Inspector MaigretAll the usual ingredients are to be found in this book but its the  page denouement that elevates this above the also rans and the swiftly written lesser Maigets in my opinion The confession of The Companions of the Apocalypse mirrors the reported events of the death of one of Georges Simenons boyhood acquaintances and armed with this knowledge it feels almost like a confession from the great writer And as close a one as youre likely to get from a man who consistently lied about himself even in his own memoirs I think the catharsis he enjoyed from writing this story is a major factor in the quality of the psychological insight to be found especially so early in the serieshis

"text": "The last live broadcast on Polish Radio on September   was Chopins Nocturne in C Minor played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman until his playing was interrupted by German shelling It was the same piece and the same pianist when broadcasting resumed six years later The Pianist is Szpilmans account of the years inbetween of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock Szpilman now  has not looked at his description since he wrote it in  the same time as Primo Levis If This Is A Man it is too personally painful The rest of us have no such excuse  Szpilmans family were deported to Treblinka where they were exterminated he survived only because a musicloving policeman recognised him This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto growing thinner and hungrier yet condemned to live Ironically it was a German officer Wilm Hosenfeld who saved Szpilmans life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp but portions of his diary reprinted here tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in  but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalins Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians Ukrainians Poles and Jews with the Nazis In  it was published in Germany after Szpilmans son found it on his fathers bookcase This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language There were  Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation after it there were  Wladyslaw Szpilmans extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives  This is the first time I am reviewing a book that I have tried and failed to rateHow do I decide on a rating anyway Should I judge the prose the content the authors style of presentation his narrative voice the quality of the translationDo I even have the right to Awarding a star rating to this mans unbelievably harrowing and miraculous tale of surviving a war which claimed the lives of  million of his fellow brethren for no reason at all seems a more sacrilegious act than calling Infinite Jest a bad book on Goodreads So I choose not toWladyslaw Szpilman a pianist working for the Polish radio station takes us through the years of Nazi occupation of Poland and Warsaw in particular and the insensate violence that had the Jewish inhabitants of the city the ones who were fortunate enough to be spared the concentration camps living the most brutal and unforgiving of nightmares for a period of almost  yearsWladyslaw SzpilmanSzpilman writes with a kind of unnerving indifference as if this were someone elses tale of horrors he is narrating and not his own It is obvious that since he had written this in  immediately after the war his senses may still have been numbed under the influence of the barbarous acts he had witnessed through the  years of the Occupation His voice doesnt sound sarcastic debilitated or even a little bit acerbic Instead he gives us a neat uncluttered unemotional chronologically ordered account of events which saw him narrowly escaping certain death many many timesBut this is not just his story A surprise awaits the unsuspecting reader at the very end in the form of Wilm Hosenfeld a Nazi officer who saved Szpilmans life in the last few months of  An astonishingly mildmannered generous soul who not only kept the knowledge of Szpilmans existence a secret from the other SS officers but saved him from certain death out of starvation and the unbearable coldBut true to the nature of war which justifies countering violence with more violence Hosenfeld was taken as a prisoner of war when the Soviets finally recaptured Poland He was tortured to death years later  in some unnamed labor camp in the icy swathes of Stalingrad His tormentors were especially cruel with him angered by his claims of having saved the lives of many Jews and Poles during the Warsaw occupation Which of course was nothing but the truthWilhelm Adalbert HosenfeldIt goes without saying while reading this book I had no sense of time or any movement around me I had no idea whether it was still daytime or whether night had fallen Turning over the last page when I finally took note of my surroundings I discovered my pillow was halfwet with tears and that I had a dreadful headacheSome of the most poignant haunting and reflective passages of the narrative are in Wilms journal which was recovered years later and incorporated into Szpilmans memoir    A mere German officer seems to have had the moral strength to admit    And yet the great Der Fhrer in front of whom a vast Empire bowed down at one point of time could only choose the cowards way out by committing suicide in the end A million stars to the courage of Wladyslaw Szpilman who aided the Jewish resistance in the Warsaw ghetto disregarding the constant threat to his own life A million stars to his unflinchingly honest attempt at looking back at a terrible past A million stars for enabling the citizens of the world to read know and derive lessons from the story of his life A million stars to Wilm Hosenfeld for holding on to his conscience at a time when morality and compassion were in short supply And a million stars to the triumph of the human spirit So you see the correct rating of this book should be  million stars which is beyond the scope of Goodreads Wilm Hosenfeld was posthumously recognized as a Righteous among the Nations in  by IsraelPS This review maybe updated after I watch the movie   As always these books are so incredibly hard to read not just to read but to understand how these cruelties could have ever happened This book was different in that it was not only written by someone in Poland who survived the Holocaust but someone who probably only survived because of the help of a German officer Excerpts from this officers diary are included in the back of the book as are explanatory notes tying everything together The tome of the book is rather matter of fact since it is written right after the war it was explained that it was written this way because the author could still not quite come to terms with the massive amounts of cruelty and lives lostI never knew that although more Polish Jews were exterminated than elsewhere some three to four hundred thousand Poles risked their lives to save Jews After the war the author continued to play piano in Poland This was for a long time a banned book I am glad that now everyone has the opportunity to reads this story   I loved The Pianist for a number of reasons but the supreme reason goes to Wadysaw Szpilmans storytelling Szpilman writes down the struggles he had endured to survive when Warsaw was under occupation by the Nazis Wadysaw voice never grows bitter plus his emotions never twist to abhorrence and its why I find myself respecting him so admirably His story was in no means out of hatred or disgust His intention was not to spit political statements about WWII As mentioned on the title it was solely based on his extraordinary true story to survive when the whole of Europe went into chaos Not to forget it was about his determination to live long enough in the hopes to achieve his dreamWladyslaw Szpilman was a polish Jew born in Warsaw He had three siblings and two loving parents He was a talented musician growing up he studied in Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw Poland and then attended the prestigious Academy of Arts in Berlin before Hitler was in power He then worked at a polish radio performing Jazz and classical music But at  the Nazis invaded Poland and developed a new general government which established a ghetto in Warsaw specifically for Jews Life for Wadysaw turned into a daily torture Hunger and illness sweeped every corner of the streets in the ghetto Senseless hate by the Nazis and unjustified death leads Szpilman to escape rather than await his death However survival behind the walls of the Warsaw ghetto proves to be as difficult as a rapid death   Szpilman out of all odds survived the six year war Considering all he underwent it did not leave him with a taste of vengeance and animosity I thought at first if I read more inbetween the lines then I would catch some slight repugnance towards the Germans but Wadysaw displayed none whatsoever I was not the only one curious about this so when the book reached the epilogue written by a German poet Wolf Biermann I finally had my answer which simply strengthens my respect for Szpilman  I will lastly talk about Captain Wilm Hosenfeld who I cant help but include in my review Captain Wilm at first really appeared as if something out of a fairytale  the bad guy aiding the enemy Hosenfeld helped Szpilman survive when he was closest to his death Captain Wilm Hosenfeld is very much a hero with his capability to clearly draw the line between wrong and right when countless other Nazis were utterly nave The book gives an extract from the diary of Hosenfeld His opinions are very matter of fact on how villainous the Nazi Germans were  Overall you mightor might not pick up The Pianist but if youre still interested in the story then the film version of The Pianist is also a great insight of Wadysaw Szpilmans survival     Ive read a lot about World War II but Id never fully grasped the complete destruction the utter devastation of the city of Warsaw Hitler was like a bratty child with a toy hed rather destroy than share with anyone else When he knew he was going to lose the war he ordered that Warsaw be reduced to rubble Among the ruins there was a Jewish musician named Wladyslaw Szpilman who had managed to survive for six years and a German named Wilm Hosenfeld who saved Szpilmans life one last time I read this entire book in  hours Szpilman wrote his account immediately after the war ended so you can sometimes feel that sense of urgency that need to pour everything out onto the page and purge himself so he could begin to recover and build a new life He had a long career as a performer and composer and died in The book also includes some excerpts from the diary of Wilm Hosenfeld He didnt personally kill or brutalize anyone during the war but he never flinched from the collective responsibility of the German people for what they allowed Hitler to do to the world It was later discovered that Hosenfeld had also helped other Jews during the war I hope he did finally get his tree on the Avenue of the Just in Yad Vashem    Hitler atamancou os ressentimentos da Alemanha derivados da capitulao

"text": "Georges Simenon writing autobiographically once confessed his desire to drop out of society to sever family ties and disassociate himself from his friends His empathy with misfits is reflected in Simenons police superintendent Jules MaigretWhen Maigret learns that a bums murder is in reality an assassination he becomes deeply involved in what without him would have been left as an unremarkable event Maigret must discover the identity of the man who had been living under the Seine bridge then find out why anyone would want him dead Who hit a homeless man over the head while he was asleep and chucked him in the Seine in midwinter and why What could anyone possibly stand to gain Is his socialclimber wife trying to get rid of him or does he know too much about something And just exactly what is the Belgian bargees problemThis installment is more of a psychological study of Inspector Maigret himself showing how he goes about investigating getting a handle on a case and the people involved He breaks precedent by discussing the case with Madame Maigret who offers a helping hand as well as a listening ear Not my favourite Maigret as I found it unsatisfying but then so did the Inspector Just goes to show that real police work is not always open and shut there isnt always a confession or even decent clues All right to pass an hour or two but not up to Simenons usual standard And Im not sure I would agree with the idea that no homeless people who sleep under bridges would ever ever steal from each other or ever be violent That premise certainly wouldnt stand up to scrutiny in my city and I wonder if it did in s Paris One of the few cases in which the film is much better than the book though the script is faithful to the novel the performances carry what is otherwise a bland and uninteresting tale   Maigret and the Dosser was first published as Maigret et le Clochard in  and translated into English by Jean Stewart This is a lesser Maigret which depends on an incredible coincidence for its plot structure The dosser of the title is the chief character a witness to a crime of which he wont speak and now the victim of an attempted murder Simenon is mainly interested in this character but is unable to develop his story except in a perfunctory way Yet it still takes the focus of the book away from Maigrets investigation and leaves the book without a centre The crime is extremely unlikely even for a routine detective story which this book is Maigret is unsuccessful in proving his case because it is all his own supposition without a shred of evidence and very fanciful indeed No wonder the man accursed sneers at him And Simenon seems unsuccessful in doing what he set out to do with the book which might have developed into a novel more successfully than remaining the basis for a detective story   MAIGRET AND THE BUMMAIGRET AND THE WINE MERCHANT by Georges Simenon are very much two of a kind Reading either of these classic Maigret titles takes us back to  and  Paris and what seems a much simpler time I read these just before and after the attacks of Friday the th and have considered what to write for almost two monthsThese books are a snapshot look into a past that never really existed In both Maigret and the Paris police seem part of a sleepy little village where the homeless are never attacked and where wives turn away from the affairs of their husbands In the first book a bum is left for dead in the Seine River but manages to survive the attack When questioned by Maigret he refuses to talk and the investigation slowly picks out the details of a life abandoned and the problem is solvedThe wine merchant is a nasty bit of work with an entire cast of characters who might have wished him dead but here again the slow deliberations of the inspector reveal the truth of the matterBoth now seem like a dream of a better time but neither is There has always been unthinkable violence lurking behind the scenes always an injustice waiting to be corrected and these stories are mere lullabies to help us sleep at night We still need these stories They are a part of the heritage of the world and a place to look when we seek heroes to help us through our days Inspector Maigret my be just a work of fiction but he along with a pantheon of those who seek justice have inspired tens of thousands to root out the evil of the world and set things rightAs in the story of the bum there are times when you must acknowledge you cant fix everything but it is the work the striving which sets the ideal   Una incursione di un occhio borghese nel mondo dei clochard di cosa sono diventati oggi di coserano dei perch alcuni di loro lo sono diventati e delle loro regole degenerazioni speranze vizi virt

office of the Hand His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will not what he must  and a dead enemy is a thing of beautyThe old gods have no power in the south Starks family is split and there is treachery at court Worse the vengeancemad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities He claims the Iron Throne There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre Ironically they often write the most predictable books of all as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini Though Im not sure why they protest so muchpredictability is rarely a death sentence in genre fantasyThe archetypal story of the hero the villain the great love and a world to be saved never seems to get oldand theres nothing wrong with this story when its told well At the best its exciting exotic and builds to a fulfilling climax At the worst its just a bloodless rehash and the worst are more common by farPerhaps it was this wealth of predictable cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different Unfortunately being different isnt something you can choose to do any more than you can choose to be creative Sure Moorcock wrote Elric to be the antiConan but at some point he had to stretch out and find a core for his series that was more than just thatand he didIn similar gesture Martin rejects moralistic romance tearing the guts out of epic fantasy the wonder the ideals the heroism and with them the moral purpose Fine so he took out the rollicking fun and the social messagewhat did he replace them withLike the postMoore comics of the nineties fantasy has borne witness to a backlash against the moral hero and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him Hell if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes he didnt have to reject the staples of fantasy he could have gone to its roots Howard Leiber and AndersonLike many authors aiming at realism he forgets that truth is stranger than fiction The real world is full unbelievable events coincidences and odd characters When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real they make their fiction duller than reality after all unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitudeWhen Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance they replaced it with odd and exciting charactersthings strange enough to feel true In comparison Martins world is dull and gray Instead of innovating new radical elements he merely removes familiar staplesand any world defined by lack is going to end up feeling thinDespite trying inject the book with history and realism he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist with pet albino wolf Apparently to him grim realism is Draco in Leather Pants This produces a conflicted tonea soap opera cast for an existentialist filmTheres also lots of sex and misogyny and walltowall rapenot that books should shy away from sexor from any uncomfortable unpleasant reality of life The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it and it seems to plague every mainstream fantasy authorTheir pen gets away from them their own hangups start leaking into the scene Its not about the characters anymore its the author cybering about his favorite fetishand if I cyber with a fat bearded stranger I expect to be paid for itI know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do like night elf hunters humping away in WOW but reading Goodkind Jordan and Martinits like seeing a Playboy at your uncles where all the pages are wrinkled Thats not to say there isnt serviceable pop fantasy sex out thereits just written by womenThough I didnt save any choice examples I did come across this quote from a later book  Imagine the process Martin sits hands hovering over the keys trying to get inside his characters headOkay Im a woman How do I see and feel the world differently My cultural role is defined by childbirth I can be bought and sold in marriage by my ownOh hey Ive got tits Man look at those things go whooshing mammary sound effects Okay time to writeWhere are the descriptions of variouslysized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdlydetailed clothing There are a set of manboobswhich perhaps Martin has some personal experience withbut not until book five Even then its not the dude being hyperaware of his owntheyre just there to gross out a dwarf Not really a balanced depictionIf youre familiar with the showand its parodies on South Park and SNLthis lack of dongs may surprise you But as Martin himself explained when asked why theres no gay sex in his books though there are gay characters theyre not the viewpoint charactersas if somehow the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control Apparently he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author sorry none of my characters chose to be gay nothing I can do about itAnd balance is really the problem hereif only depict the dark gritty stuff that youre into thats not realism its just trying to hide a fetish If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape but the same thing never happens to a male character despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women then your gritty realism card definitely gets revokedThe books are also notorious for sudden pointless deaths which some suggest is another sign of realismbut of course nothing is pointless in fiction because everything that shows up on the page is there because the author put it there Sure in real life people suddenly die before finishing their lifes work fantasy authors do it all the time but theres a reason we dont tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things they are boring and pointless They build up for a while then eventually lead nowhereNovelists often write in isolation so its easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere your story is always a fiction Any time you treat it as if it were real you are working against yourself The writing feels the most natural is never effortless it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that wayA staple of Creative Writing  is to listen to how people really talk which is terrible advice A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition halfthoughts and nonspecific words stuff thing as to be incomprehensibleespecially without the cues of tone and body language Written communication has its own rules so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play Its the same with sudden character deaths treat them like a history and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable Like in an action film they are a plot convenience kill off a villain and you dont have to wrap up his arc You dont have to defeat him psychologicallythe finality of his death is the great equalizer You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right because hes the only option leftLikewise in Martins book death ties up loose threadsnamely plot threads Often this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs which makes them rather predictable any time a character is about to get enough influence to make things better or more stable he will die Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the plot will first be built up and then killed offI found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths  Hes not talking about the internal motivations of the characters or the ideas the characters representhe isnt laying out a wellstructured plothes just building up a character then killing them to defy expectation But the only reason we think these characters are important and expect them to succeed is because of how Martin sets them upHe treats them as central heroes spending time and energy on them but it all ends up being a red herring so he can get rid of them for a cheap twist Its like the mystery novels of the s when all the good plots had already been done so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapterits only surprising because the author has torn up the structure of their own book and with it the relationship between author and readerAll authors begin by writing plot arcs that grow and change building tension and purpose Normally when such arcs end the author must use all the force of his skill to deal with themes and answer questions providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers have watched growOr you could just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him That way you never have to worry about closure you can just hook your readers by crafting a new arc from the chaos caused by the dissolution of the previous one Start to make the reader believe that things might get better to believe in a character then wave your arms in distraction yell and point look at that terrible thing over there and hope your audience becomes so caught up in worrying about this new problem that they forget that the old one never actually resolvedBy chaining false endings together you can create a perpetual tension that never requires solutionlike in most soap operasplus the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started If an author is lucky they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up Its easy to idolize Kurt Cobain because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee RothUnlucky authors live to write the Final Book breaking the spell of continual tension and expectation that kept their readers enthralled Since the plot has not been resolving into a tight intertwined conclusion in fact its probably been spiraling out of control the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly leaving fans confused and upset Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguelyspiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tackedon climax actually hell probably do it anyways with dragonsThe drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end the story fundamentally leads nowhereit winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs But then doesnt that sound more like real life Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy and in doing so rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions Perhaps we shouldnt compare him to other writers of romance but to HistoriesHe asks us to believe in his intrigue his grimness and his amoral world of war power and deathnot the false Europe of Arthur Robin Hood and Orlando but the real Europe of plagues power struggles religious wars witch hunts and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countrysideUnfortunately he doesnt compare very well to them either His intrigue is not as interesting as Ciceros Machiavellis Enguerrand de Coucysor even Sallusts who was practically writing fiction anyways Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history but those are the same histories that lent Howard Leiber and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield even Tolkien had his EddasMore than anything this book felt like a serial melodrama the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with being drawn in by emotional appeals the hope that things will get better in this dark place tragic deaths even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism and in the end there is no grander story to unify the whole This grittiness is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of glory with one of hardship and despite flipping this switch its still just an emotional appeal Heroes always win is just as boring and predictable as heroes always loseIts been suggested that I didnt read enough of Martin to judge him but if the first four hundred pages arent good I dont expect the next thousand will be different If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories you get  pages including introductions end notes and variant scripts If you take Martins first two books in this series you get  pages Already less than halfway through the series hes written more than Howards entire Conan output and all I can do is ask myself why does he need that extra lengthA few authors use it to their advantage but for most its just sprawling undifferentiated bloat Melodrama can be a great way to mint money as evidenced by the endless variations on a theme of Soap Operas Pro Wrestling Lost and mainstream superhero comics Plenty of people enjoy it but its neither revolutionary nor realisticSome have tried to defend this book by saying at least Martin isnt as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy but saying hes better than dreck is really not very high praise Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all pointing to my lowstar reviews of Martin Wolfe Jordan and Goodkind but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authorsA lover of fine wines winces the more when he is given a corked bottle of vinegar a ballet enthusiasts love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition and likewise having learned to appreciate Epics Histories the Matter of Europe Fairy Tales and their modern offspring the fantasy genre I find Martin woefully lackingTheres plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there from its roots in epic poetry to the Thousand and One Nights to the early fantasies of Eddison Dunsany Morris Macdonald Haggard and Kipling Then there are more modern authors Poul Anderson Moorcock MJohn Harrison Vance Susanna Clarke Neil Gaiman Mervyn Peake China Mieville Phillip Pullman Howard Lovecraft and LeiberThere seems to be a sense that Martins work is somehow revolutionary that it represents a new direction for fantasy but all I see is a reversion Sure hes different than Jordan Goodkind and their ilk who simply took the pseudomedieval highmagic world from Tolkien and the bloodandguts heroism from Howard Martin on the other hand has more closely followed Tolkiens lead than any other modern high fantasy authorand I dont just mean in terms of racismTolkien wanted to make his story realnot realistic using the dramatic techniques of literaturebut actually real by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story Over the span of the first twenty years he released The Hobbit the Lord of the Rings and other works while in the twenty years after that he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories he filled his shed with a bunch of notes which his son has been trying unsuccessfully to make a complete book from ever sinceIts the same thing Martins trying to do cover a bland story with a litany of details that dont contribute meaningfully to his characters plot or tone So if Martin is good because he is different then it stands to reason that hes not very good because hes not that different He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style but thats just one small corner of a very expansive genre Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the father of fantasy doesnt know enough about the genre to judge what originality meansSo if Martin neither an homage nor an original Im not sure whats left In his attempt to set himself apart he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy but failed replace it with anything worthwhile There is no revolutionary voice here and there is nothing in Martins book that has not been done better by other authorsHowever there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do kill the longrunning High Fantasy series According to some friends of mine in publishing and some amusingly onthenose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview Martins inability to deliver a book on time combined with his awful relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy serieseven from recognized authors Apparently Martin is so bad at structuring that he actually preemptively ruined books by other authors Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings   Though I declined to finish this book Ill leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue onIf you need some kind of closure avoid this series No arcs will ever be completed nothing will ever really change The tagline is Winter is Comingits not As the series goes on there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other even as it increasingly becomes just another My Fantasy Book

LogicI HATE this bookI HATE it so much I had to get a new hardback copy to read so I could underline all the parts I HATE about it so much and post them on GoodreadsI HATE it with such a passion I also bought copies for all my friends and family also in new hardback editions so they could HATE it along with meWhen the TV series came on I was so fuming with rage I watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the DVD because I could not believe how much I could HATE somethingI had spent so much time discussing how much I HATE this with all my friends who HATE it too and who all bought copies I decided to get a George RR Martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my HATRED for his work is There was such a collectivity at the timelike everyone uniting in HATING this togetherthat some of us formed relationships in HATE I met my wife at a George RR Martin convention and we got married as one of the characters reciting parts of the book for our vows and paid GRRM all our life savings to come read from his HORRIBLE book We HATE this beyond belief Maybe one day well read a book we like and the author can get rich on LOVE   I really feel the necessity of a bit of personal backstory here before I start the review Back in  when this book first came out and I was about  or  years old I saw the hardcover on a sale table for about  and couldnt resist a bargain still cant though Im more cautious these days So I started reading this book with the vague idea that it was a flop and that may not have helped but I got through  pages of it before feeling so crapped off with it that I shoved it in my cupboard and tried not to think about it Page  to be exact More on why laterIf youve heard of this book or read it youre probably aware that far from being the flop I assumed it was at the time and I didnt know anyone who was reading it the series has gone on to be one of the big Cash Cows of the fantasy genre Computer games roleplaying games  theres even a board game that looks like Risk Sooner or later therell be a movie or something no doubt Im moderately surprised one isnt in the works already People love this book and this series So Im well aware Ill probably be lynched for this review because even the people on Goodreads who didnt like it still had great things to say about itBut reviews are subjective and heres mineIn the vein of Tolkein Jordan Elliott Goodkind Hobb Eddings Feist et al A Game of Thrones is set in the classicly boringandoverdone medievalEnglandesque setting and is essentially about a bunch of nobles fighting over a throne Great Very original Praised for its focus on political intrigue its lack of magic and similar fantasy tropes and its cast of believable and interesting characters I found the book tedious The first epic fantasy series I read after Narnia was Jordans The Wheel of Time series and its true that I struggled with the first book Eye of the World But there were elements to it that I liked characters who I felt attached to enough to read the second book and become hooked and so on I love page long fat fantasy books I love huge casts of characters and have no problem keeping up with them Ive read Jennifer Fallons Wolfblade trilogy and Second Sons Trilogy both of which are heavy on political intrigue and very low on magic and theyre supurb A Game of Thrones is not It offers nothing new to the genre and does nothing original with what it hasNarrated in turns by Eddard Ned Stark Lord of Winterfell his wife Lady Catelyn his bastard son Jon Snow his very young daughters Sansa and Arya his middle son Bran Tyrion Lannister a dwarf and brother to the Queen and young Daenerys Targaryen last of the line of dragon kings and exiled to the land beyond the narrow sea the book is divided into neat chapters headed by the name of one or the other so you know exactly whose pointofview youre going to get and where you are in the plot Thanks for holding my hand Martin but I dont like this technique The chapter headings Im referring to It encourages me to start wondering about the character before Ive even started reading CATELYN the chapter title reads is she young or old a peasant a farmer a daughter a mother nice mean I start imagining things and then have to correct it all as the character is revealed during the chapter Theres power in names and withholding them or putting elements of a characters personality first is often more compelling and better writing It also made it harder to get through the book because at the end of one chapter Id see the name of the next think oh great himher again their storys boring and put the book downLet me be perfectly straight I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting though Jaime Lannister had something about him you hardly ever saw him They all pretty much felt like the same character just in different situations The differences between them for example the goodgirl Sansa and her tomboy sister Arya felt forced superficial and clichd Ned is all about honour and duty but especially honour with love a more minor consideration but honestly could the man be more stupid Eddards a moron and dull and his only saving grace is that hes nice to his daughters Lets be clear about something else right here this world and its people are so sexist and misogynist its ludicrous There are many derogatory references to womens tits metaphors about screwing whores descriptions of Daenerys getting her nipples pinched by her horrible brother Viserys  not to mention her marriage at twelve to a horselord whose men rape women like theres no tomorrow incest and so on The first time I tried to read this book I was offended and disgusted it didnt help that Id read Pillars of the Earth not long before though I did not grow up sexually repressed or prudish or anything like that I have never found reading descriptions of rape to be all that easy especially when theyre treated so dismissively  yet oddly my impressions of the characters were much more favourable I read it now and I just felt contemptNo one character stands out though Arya has potential Catelyn is as boring as her husband and her sister Lysa is lets face it mad as a hatter and a sure sign of why women are unfit to rule a clear message in this medievalesque patriarchal world Queen Cercei too Tyrion the dwarf seems on the verge of having charisma but fails and Daenerys I want to like someone but Martin doesnt give his characters any depth Sure theyre all flawed and a flawed character is a great literary device  the antihero etc But Martins characters are walking clichs even the dwarf The plot is also pretty weak I dont need elves and magic and dragons  in fact I tend to avoid them especially elves yawn  but youve gotta give me something else A bildungsroman does wonders  yes let me see the characters on a journey of life rather than a quest quests are tired Theres no quest in A Game of Thrones and thats fine with me But what is there Jon goes to the Wall that separates the wilderness from the Seven Kingdoms why is it called the Seven Kingdoms when theres only one kingdom and is attacked by an Other a kind of zombie creature Ned goes to the capital to take up the role of Kings Hand because the King Robert likes to spend his time boozing whoring and hunting Catelyn follows to tell him someone tried to kill Bran Ned tries to discover why the previous Hand died And swords with names seriously whats with that Im so sick of such blatant phallic symbols and their representations and the whole creed of honour and duty and gallant knightsWhat frustrates me most is that this could have been a really interesting story if only the author had better talent at writing characters  or letting them write themselves The plot is not the problem though its largely uneventful with no climactic moments because even those are written at the same pace as the rest with no drammatic flourishes come on we all like those lets be honest But the characters sigh their motivations are simplistic their actions extremely predictable and while they dont blur one into another neither do any of them stand out Also the type of setting seems mostly convenient with the focus on the nobles and their squabbling you dont learn much about the lower classes or what kind of food is grown here or what kind of industry supports the economy or anything about the cultures  using the clichd medieval England setting allows Martin to ignore one of the more fascinating aspects of society and leaves his world shallow like surface water without support using this old and worn Fantasy setting allows an author to get lazy about worldbuilding The history of the land is also riddled with clichs and sort of thrown in here and there as if to remind the reader it is a real place look heres what the First Men did As for the writing its easy to read and calm though very slow and rather lacking in tone or any interesting stylistic quirks flat and bland in other words Theres no atmosphere in this book Therere a few bad lines like A storm of rose petals blew across a bloodstreaked sky as blue as the eyes of death p  his one concession to drama it seems though if you read it again youll notice it doesnt actually make sense and a few awkward sentences that leave you scrambling such as Catelyn watched her son Robb Stark mount up Olyvar Frey held his horse for him Lord Walders son two years older than Robb and ten years younger and more anxious p I noticed a similar sentence later and I guess I know what he means but really its terrible writingOn the plus side there were a few things I liked The direwolves  large ferocious animals as constant companions and protectors always a winner with me the intriguing climate where summer and winter lasts years decades even before changing how does that work Seriously what do they eat Daenerys dragon eggs and the Dothraki the horse lords  though they were pretty superficial and confined to a rigid list of adjectives  I would have liked to understand their culture better In many fantasy books my problem is the whole good vs evil clich which generally involves the plot Here my problem is that the characters are so blackandwhite They are described good thats settled now what Theres no grey No character development They never once surprised meI honestly dont know if Ill read the next book The Wheel of Time taught me at the same age as I first tried reading this book  that the first book in a series can be the weakest because of the amount of extrapolation and background etc that goes on I didnt find that problem here it was very grounded in the now which makes me think the next book will be more of the same I keep coming back to the reasons why I struggled to finish this book boredom clichd and empty characters not enough balance as in theres no love in this book and if the characters are so realistic why dont they love and predictable events You know what it reminds me of Marion Zimmer Bradleys equally famous The Mists of Avalon  another book I couldnt finish If you like Arthurian fantasy and that kind of style then this would be a good book for you the excessively patriarchal culture the battles the hint of magic and something glorious lurking around the edges but never coming to the fore its all here neatly packaged Obviously it works for a lot of people But to all those people who say that Martin has opened up the genre in new ways that he is the best writer of the epic fantasy crowd and so on I have to wonder have they read anything else And then I wonder whether its a matter of which author you read first and grow attached to and so compare all the others I dont think I fell into that trap as such because Jordans lost the plot literally Goodkinds personal politics and propaganda have taken over his story and the one epic fantasy series that I love above all others  to date  is Kate Elliotts Crown of Stars series which I didnt start reading till I was in uni But I really wonder how this story grabbed other people If it grabbed you Id love to hear how and why because sometimes I feel like Im too jaded or something too snobby maybe    EDIT  Dec  I no longer get notifications for the comments Feel free to duke it out with each other just dont expect me to respondWARNING If you enjoyed this book even a little bit you may not want to read this review It will probably make you angry Heaven knows that the book made me furious and I intend to turn every bit of that wrath back on itInstead I suggest you read karens review Brigids review Joyzis review or any other of the gushing four and fivestar reviews here If video reviews are more your style I suggest Melina Pendulums vlog about this bookRealistically I know a lot of you are not going to listen which is why the edit is here At least it will slow you down a littleEDIT adding one more thing because despite the warning and the redirect links I kindly provided I have indeed gotten the kind of sexist bullshit comments I anticipated Before you launch into the usual defense therefore I give you thisAlternatively some fans may find it tempting to argue Well this media is a realistic portrayal of societies like X Y Z But when you say that sexism and racism and heterosexism and cissexism have to be in the narrative or the story wont be realistic what you are saying is that we humans literally cannot recognise ourselves without systemic prejudice nor can we connect to characters who are not unrepentant bigots Um yikes YIKES you guysSourceHeres the scoop on this review For a book that I hate I usually write a lot After suffering for several hundred pages I have pleeeenty of things to say Ive never hated a book that was quite as long as this one quite as much as I do so Ive had to alter my review so that I can say everything I want to without going over the character limitThe first part is an unorganized rant I marked pages with particularly annoying quotes on them for these rants I broke the book into segments of  pages and wrote up quotes and responses for each segment into separate blog posts These are all linked belowThe second part will be a more organized rant masquerading as a review MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A HATER REVIEW IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO CAUSE ME TO SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO BREATHE FIRE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS BOOKPart Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Part There are books I dont likeThere are books I And thentheres this book which did its level best to drive me to drinkingand I dont even like alcoholI wanted to like this I wanted it to be as excellent as so many people insist it is There are some books that I went into expecting them to be horrible but this isnt one of them Oh my hopes were high here  it was recommended by a plethora of great authors including the guys of Writing Excuses who I absolutely love Reviewers who I greatly respect rated it four and five stars and wrote at length about how awesome it was Other people praised the book as the greatest achievement of the fantasy genre so far and Martin as the greatest fantasy writer of all timeIts those last two that are most important I think because I love the fantasy genre  always have and hopefully always will Fantasy is what got me into reading well Harry Potter specifically and its been one of my mainstays for as long as I can remember I bought this book in large part because it was so often touted as if not always the greatest achievement of the genre one of the major works of fantasy published in our time Having recently read several works by Brandon Sanderson all of which were innovative highly readable and deeply philosophical I was excited to see what Martin by all reports an even better writer than Sanderson could do I expected my mind to be blown repeatedly and to be faced with the challenge of writing a review for a book so staggeringly brilliant that I could hardly think straight after finishing itThat is far far far from what I gotFirst of all this book is definitely not what I think of when I hear the word fantasy Its certainly far from my definition of high fantasy Now I realize that my definition of high fantasy which includes pervasive magic unusual creatures and a setting that is vividly far from the real world is not the definition youll find if you look the term up online I also dont care Seeing as the critical definition appears to characterize high fantasy solely by the fact that it doesnt take place on our Earth and as this definition is written as if high fantasy and swordandsorcery are mutually exclusive Im inclined to conclude that whoever wrote said definition is pretty damn stupid and carry on with my own outlines of what makes fantasy high low urban epic or any other subcategory or combination thereofThat said  this book High fantasy Not as far as Im concerned It is to say the least distinctly lacking in the requisite elements of the fantasticIs it possible that Martin is going for a the magic comes back subplot over the course of the series Definitely Do I give two shits about the rest of the series NOPEThis book comes off as a pathetic attempt at fantasy by someone who doesnt really care about the genre or doesnt know much about it It mostly struck me more as an alternate universe War of the Roses fanfiction with some hints of magic thrown in in a halfassed attempt to give it a place on the genre fiction shelves of bookstores You can explain to me over and over how Martin intended to make his world gritty and realistic and I will tell you over and over that that shouldnt matter that it is possible to have a fantasy which is gritty realistic and also utterly fantastical Its even possible to do it without losing the particular areas where Martin seemed to be trying for gritty realism since he chose to make all of his characters of the nobility anyhow he wouldnt have had to worry about overglorifying the lives of the peasantry as one might with a more economically diverse castNow Im willing to give Martin the benefit of the doubt a little bit on the possibility of the magic comes back thing because there did seem to be elements here that could become fantastical if fully explained later The problem of course is that theyre tossed out without background let alone proper explanation and so feel jarring and out of place  not a coherent part of the world but bits tossed in to be linked together later Right now all they managed to do was trip me up throw me assoverteakettle out of the story and leave me blinking at the page in confusion and not a little bit of frustrationAnd yeah maybe part of why Im so sore about this is that like I said I started this book not long after reading some Sanderson and Sanderson is basically the king of seamless fantastical elegant worldbuilding so pretty much anyone looks bad in comparison but stillIf I had to assign this book to a genre Id call it low fantasy because as far as Im concerned it was running too low on the qualities that make fantasy what it is Its about as much fantasy as fanfiction that translates characters to the modern day is  namely basically mundane with a miniscule twistThe characters of this book also stand out and not in a good wayThere are a lot of them  eight POVs and plenty more on the side  and not a single one of them is likeable They all had the potential to be which makes it worse Bran the Stark boy who learns too much and is crippled as a result could have an interesting arc if it werent so slow and drawnout The hints of genuine pathosinducing story are definitely there Theyre also present in the chapters focused on Catelyn who is the closest Martin gets to a truly nuanced character Ned Stark Catelyns husband is supposed to be the noble one  too bad his nobility comes off as stupidity instead Jon Snow Neds bastard child is a truly stereotypical fantasy character the super special outcast who is nonetheless generally loved except by those the narration makes a point to show as bigoted and cruel who never really has to work either for physical skills or personal growth and who gets gifted by the narrative with an absurd number of SUPER UNIQUE TRAPPINGS including an albino wolf really Martin REALLY Are you secretly a fourteen yearold girl writing horrendous anime fanfic or something Answer no and the comparison is insulting to fourteen yearold girls and a bastard sword that was a family heirloom of a noble house not his own Arya is by far the most entertaining of the Starks but only because she fulfills all sorts of rebelliousnoblegirllearnstofight tropes that Im quite fond of Sansas chapters made me set the book down for days on end she is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most insipid annoying airheaded character I have ever read and she has not a single whisper of a redeeming quality Tyrion Lannister is what Jon Snow could have become without the heapings of Gary Stu in his youth a bitter middleaged man with father issues who turns to sex and crudity as his only defense somewhat akin to Catelyn he had the potential to be interesting and nuanced if his behavior hadnt been played dead straightAnd theres one more Daenerys Targaryen Oh Dany Dany Dany I could write a dissertation on Dany and everything that went wrong with her story  but I dont have that kind of timeFor those of you not familiar with this most epic of George RR Martins characterization and plot failures here is a summaryoh and spoilers but I honestly cant be bothered to tag itWhen we first meet her Dany is thirteen years ond and about to be sold effectively into marriage with Khal Drogo a warlord of the Dothraki people by her abusive and notalittlebitcrazy brother Viserys Viserys has convinced himself that Drogo will help him take back his kingdom  this being the Seven Kingdoms where the rest of the book takes place  hence the whole selling his sister to be raped by married to someone he obviously sees as a barbarian thing The marriage occurs and then the wedding night in truly squicky halfdetail There then follows a long journey across the plains to a Dothraki city during which Dany is raped and no I will not call it anything else by Drogo By her fourteenth birthday she is pregnant When they arrive in the Dothraki city Viserys makes such an ass of himself that Drogo kills him by pouring molten gold over his head in the middle of a feasting hall Robert the current king of the Seven Kingdoms who the Targaryens see as a usurper sends assassins to kill Dany  naturally they fail  and Drogo gets so angry at this that he decides to commit all his people to attacking the Seven Kingdoms in retribution They leave the Dothraki city at this point Dany is heavily pregnant and go out to wreak havoc across the countryside on their way to conquest In one such battle Drogo is wounded because he refuses to care for the wound properly it gets infected When it is clear that he is going to die Dany appeals to an old woman to perform forbidden magic to save him the rest of Drogos people do not approve and try to cast Dany out End result Dany loses her child to create a Drogozombie which she then smothers When his body is placed on the traditional pyre she adds in three supposedly dead dragon eggs given to her as wedding gifts and which any fool could see hundreds of pages off were bound to hatch and surprise surprise they hatchTo which my primary objections are The blinding obviousness of the ending The fact that this single plotline  this single POV among eight  is so far distant from and so barely related to the others  The first two are selfexplanatory the third of course is the big thorny problem Now I can sort of understand the perspective which argues that Dany is taking control of her sexuality  she comes to enjoy sex and even to initiate and control it at times However SHE IS AT NO POINT OLDER THAN FOURTEEN Theres a reason that such a concept as an age of consent exists  there is an age at which teenagers are genuinely immature and probably shouldnt be making lifechanging decisions like say things that could get them pregnant Now I understand that in the medieval times like those that this book is based on girls were getting married and having children a lot earlier and that people in general were more mature at an early age However Dany shows none of that maturity until after shes been with Drogo for weeks  if not months When shes married to him she is if anything unusually innocent for her age Its a little hard for me to accept the idea that shes taking control of her sexuality when shes so young and clueless that her first sexual experience is a choice only inasmuch as she chooses not to fight back Not fighting back by the way doesnt mean its not rape particularly in the situation that Dany is in vastly younger than Drogo vastly weaker browbeaten by her abusive brother and told over and over that her obligation is to do whatever her husband wants Nor are her later sexual experiences ones of choice in fact it is explicitly stated that even when she had horrible saddle sores and could barely walk she was expected to be available for sex and treated as such If anything her eventual enjoyment of it seems more like a psychological block put up as a survival tactic than genuine pleasure in the act or love for DrogoYet despite the fact that this situation is obviously beyond a shadow of a doubt rape its never addressed intext If anything its portrayed as a positive experience for Dany one that makes her stronger and enables her to stand up for herself Stupid me I thought that the cancerous expansion of rapeaslove was limited to abusive jackass love interests in YA paranormal romances clearly I was wrong Its everywhere people We are all completely fucking doomedWhich brings me to one of the other major frustrations I had with this book the sex Ummm what to say I thought reading some of the Vlane bits of Darkfever while sitting next to my mother on the plane was uncomfortable to my utter shock that was nothing compared to reading the sex scenes of this book alone No worry about someone looking over my shoulder and reading about MacKayla Lane getting hot and bothered  and yet even more awkward Why Well as one reviewer put it and I wish I could remember who to give them credit theyre written kind of as if theyre these tremendous mythic events I cringe at the very thought of quoting them but to give you a little idea of what theyre like worst romance sex scenes youve ever read  bizarre flowerly euphemisms  gratuitous use of the word manhoodgeneral strange reverence for penises above and beyond the norm  incidences of incest  Game of Thrones sex sceneIn general AWKWARDJust to be sure you feel my painThis book felt maleoriented in a way that is so painfully forced that it made me distinctly uncomfortable I dont mean that women cant enjoy it  obviously as all the reviews I linked back at the top demonstrate they can and they do I mean that the book itself felt as if it were written for the most stereotypical male audience imaginable As Tatiana described it it reads like a soap opera for men Because MEN want lots of violence sex swearing by female genitalia and paperthin motivations right Which is exactly what Martin dishes upand so is the book hes producedI thought at around the halfway point that Id finish the book and be able to watch the HBO show to get the rest of the series without suffering through more awkwardly described sex scenes not to mention the rest of it By the time I finished though I had developed such a virulent hatred for this book its author and everything related to either of the above that I start grinding my teeth just reading praise for it Watching the show would be vastly to my detriment  mostly because neither my hand nor my bank account would do well after I put my fist through the screen of my laptopIn conclusionsummaryOh and to the diehard defenders of this series like those who were plaguing Keelys review who like to tell people who disagree with them that GRRM is the greatest writer of ALL TIME and that the female characters presented herein are feminist or to use an exact quote that GRRM has written some of the most independent selfreliant heroines ever to grace the fantasy genre Its more than half the reason hes so beloved His female characters disdain male attention are always smarter faster deadlier and braver than any of their male counterparts Kinda like feminists with swords which is complete and utter bullshit I have only one thing to sayTHANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT   yupnerds now i am among youthis is going to be a review where i just prattle on and on about meee meee meee because lets face it  there are a million reviews of this puppy out there so i dont have to worry about doing a disservice to the book youll either read the book or you wont but you should its got direwolvesi wasnt going to read this after years of watching hordes of desperate sadeyed nerds coming up to me asking any news on the george rr martin release like the bn computer knows more somehow than the internet it doesnt and i would have to tell them not without some schadenfreudeglee nope  it has just been moved back another year it gave me a solid sense of there but for the grace like when you see a very young junkie and you congratulate yourself for dodging that particular bulletdespite what i kept hearing about how awesome the books were i just filed it away in the mental RA folder of stuff nerds like and figured one day i would read them you know  for research but not before they were all out  i wasnt going to get sucked into the trap of so many before me  the waiting game of disappointment and having to reread the older books again and again to keep track of who was even alive at this point when you play the game of thrones you play to become frustrated and impatienti have seen it a hundred timesso when the teevee show came out and people were drooling over how good it was i paid them no mind i pushed it two feet past the someday pile in my brain because i am not one of those people who watch a movie before reading the book am ibut connor wore me down he really wanted me to see it and he wanted to talk to me about it and his bearded little face was all lit from within with enthusiasm and i just couldnt say no to himso i did it i watched the teeveee on demand  several episodes in a row pissed off if i started to get too sleepy to make it through another episodeso so goodso now i had to read it right i owe it to the gods of fine literature and allso i did and god this book is funi am glad they changed a few things for the filmed version  im not sure i would have been too comfortable watching a thirteenyearold actress play daenerys in the same line of thought  natalie  i know you have not watched the show yet but your crush on jon snow perfectly understandable to someone watching the show  he has that dark brooding thing i can see a girl going for but if you have only read the books girl your crush is on a fourteenyearold boy i have notified the authorities you pervin the end i am glad i watched the show first if only so that i know how to pronounce the characters names oh you crazy high fantasy novels and your namesalfonso wont read this series because of the incest and because they never tell you where the soldiers pooped i am not kidding several people complain that the seasonal imbalance complicates the growing cycle and where is all their food coming from this point i can understand  fantasy novels are supposed to care about developing a fullyrealized world and all and that is kind of a major detail but it doesnt bother me at all i am no connoisseur of fantasy i am a dilettante at best so i dont care where people are getting their food  i dont care if the social hierarchy is a realistic one given the particulars of this realm i certainly dont care where the soldiers are pooping nor do i care in any novel where and when the characters poop i just like this books quiet intrigues and betrayals the diplomacy the lack of hesitation when it is time for a character to be killed off i love how there arent any good guys or bad guys only effective and ineffective characters every one of them does at least one thing thatll make a reader go oh bad move so he dropped a few details when it comes to agriculture  he spent all his energies into creating characters that i love reading aboutthere are facets to this thing  sides of the argument rarely seen in a straightahead rollicking plotdriven novel and im not really sure where the misogyny accusations come from is it because women cant really ascend to power except through marriage because i dont think that was invented for this book  i am pretty sure that has happened historically in other places and if its the looting and raping well  that happens in war too wait is it sansa yeah shes kind of a wash but the girl wants what the girl wants shes at least more complicated than bella right there are plenty of good characters here that arent weak or powermad or just regularmad okay  there are a couple but sheeeeit  all the characters here are pretty bad on the moral spectrum right littlefinger is my very favorite but i wouldnt want to know him in my real life i appreciate his devotion thoughso i am super excited about clash of kings both the book i will read and the show i will watch swords and boobies and direwolves i dont even know how i am going to make it until thenoh because i was talking about boobies and HBO just there connor was telling me this story about louis ck and i loved it and i found this quote it is relevant hbo is nuditycrazy but he took care of their lust for fleshHBO was asking us why there was no nudity on the show and what they really meant was Why wasnt Pamela Adlon who played my wife nude When I hired Pam I didnt tell her she was going to be doing anything like that It wasnt supposed to be that kind of show So I said You know what Ill do it And I did that episode and they were like OK we have plenty of nudity thank youhbo thwartedlook dana i read one of your books and i have just discovered betterbooktitlescom   "},

Mother of Dragons risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent forgotten land of

and murder the price of glory may be measured in blood And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steeland the coldest hearts For when rulers clash all of the land feels the tremors Audacious inventive brilliantly imagined A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantmenta tale of pure excitement you will never forget This isnt going to be a cutesy review I am well into the third book I fear that if I dont blurt out my thoughts about this one soon then all the books in the series are going to meld together in my memory Here are my three main impressions Bleak dreary and dismalDont expect any happiness in this book Martin is merciless with his characters And if you do see a bright light dont trust it One character learned she wont have to marry an abusive horrible guy She and I were elated Then someone pointed out that her exfianc could still rape her as he desires and few would be able to stop him Darn Eeny meeny miny moeIt occurred to me halfway through a big battle that I didnt know who I was rooting for The defender is a cruel king and has a tenuous claim to the throne but I like a few of the characters in his castle and feared what would happen to them if they lose The attacker would probably be a fair king yet he is cold and distant He has a better claim than most to the throne However I doubt he could hold it for long Precisely who did I want to win It was not a problem of apathy Martin drew the characters and politics so craftily that I just could not decide Honestly instead of picking I sat back and enjoyed the twists and turns Better keep upThe scope of the plot is everexpanding I give Martin kudos for having such a grand vision and keeping it all straight I dont feel that any of the storylines are unnecessary except I hate to say it maybe Aryas And I have complete faith that they will culminate in the most amazing way by the end of series Yet it is inevitable that you will prefer some perspectives over others I counted the pages in between Daenerys chapters  an average of  pages And this is a middle book There are no cliffhangers but very little is resolved If it is resolved that means someone died Unless they are only pretending to be dead of courseI lied One more point Awesomeness   WINTERFELLLLLLLobey your nerds is what i am learningsrsly  i was never going to read this series but once i started it is like a drug and  yes  i watched season two before i read this book but i am not going to wait for seasons  to read the next one no way because i am hooked and I MUST KNOW and if any one of you people spoils the third book for me i am going to make one of those torture devices with the bucket the rat and the torch and it is byebye stomach for youi see now why it takes him so long to write these things this is the densest and more fullyrealized world i have ever read martin just plants these little seeds and they sometimes take hundreds of pages to sprout but when they do  oh my word and there are so many little details so much backstory so many overlaps and connections and history and so much depth to this world it feels so genuine it is like my beloved donald harington  where he created an entire town full of people and then just set them loose and let them live their lives and his touch is so light that it feels like he is just writing down his observances of them rather than creating them because the mind simply reels at the idea that all of these details and tight storylines came from one persons mind but with martin the scope is so much bigger and it kills me there is just so much going oni loved the second season and i love how reading the book after the season really enhanced my enjoyment most of the show is faithful to the book but not as much as the first seasonbook but one is not better than the other i am sad that some of the bookthings didnt make it into the show and sad that some of the showthings were not in the bookbut together  ahhhh  my brainheart is pleasedthe characters whose stories changed the most from the book to the screen are view spoiler it is almost entirely changed for the showand view spoileri mean really  what could be better than every single one of these scenesview spoilerso i was sad it was not in the book at alland obviously all his stuffview spoilercuz he isnt even in the book robbed view spoileroh my god a pun hmmm more thoughtsat first i hated view spoilerbecause of his affectationladen dialogue but oh man did i ever come around and now i want one for my very ownand who is a worse human beingview spoileror view spoileri am still deciding but i am rubbing my hands in glee in anticipation of just desserts although martins sense of justice is very specific and unpredictable but a girl can dreamthe book is by no means perfect every time it got to one of view spoilers pov chapters i was all zzzzzzzzzzzzz because obviously the only perspective that matters is view spoilerwho is great in the books but somehow even better onscreen and everything withview spoileris wayyy better onscreen and since she is one of my favorite actresses i am glad she has a lot more to do than was written for her originallyand george rr martinso that is hardly a book review but there are a lot of reviews for this book and i am pretty much ordering you to go out and read these right now so just do it and stop your backtalk i leave you with this thoughtand this one because oh my god  what a perfect comparison that i somehow overlookedtwins my belovedsnow go readoh but ps  CHAINSgod i loved this bookbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   It was right about at the beginning of George R R Martins A Clash of Kings the second book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series that I admitted to myself that I wanted to quit my job and everything else in my life so I could stay home and read all day I resisted the urge Im still not quite sure if I made the right decisionYou think you know someone and then you read the second book about her Or him Though for the most part the changes of the hers were more exciting for me in this book Minus the most clever and entertaining character to waddle through the pages of a fantasy book who will go unnamed so I dont spoil the fact that he lived through the first book Okay I may have given it away a little Its not that the characters went through any unrealistic shifts its just that Martin let us get to know them even better and we got to watch how they responded to new situations Or at least I did You may not have even read A Clash of Kings yet Your loss I think enjoyed the first book more because the slow corruption of an innocent and stable world interested me But everything else that utterly enthralled me from the first bookthe complex and endearing characters the mystery and intrigue the moments when honor family love and pride all seem at odds with one anotherwas there in the second and was amplified because with each chapter I grew more and more invested Dont start this series unless youre ready to devote yourself to reading every published book of it I dont know what Im going to do when Ive finished the fourth book and have to sit around waiting for Martin to write and publish the rest That will be a sad sad dayQuotes Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath themHe who hurries through life hurries to his grave A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helplessWhen we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for himPeople often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when its served upTheres no shame in fear what matters is how we face itA man agrees with god as a raindrop with the stormWhen you tear out a mans tongue you are not proving him a liar youre only telling the world that you fear what he might sayThe best lies contain within them nuggets of truth enough to give a listener pauseOh to be sure there is much we do not understand The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands and what does any man see of life but a few summers a few winters We look at mountains and call them eternal and so they seem but in the course of time mountains rise and fall rivers change their courses stars fall from the sky and great cities sink beneath the sea Everything changesThe unseen enemy is always the most fearsome   If long Fantasy stories have fundamental rules they probably go like this  create a rich world  put interesting characters in it and  mix up some sequence of interesting things happening around them happening to them and being done by them Martins first novel in this series A Game of Thrones fulfilled all three swimmingly He forged one of the deepest Fantasy realms since Tolkien with a mythology culture and history He spun characters of a few key families and then scattering them throughout that world and by the midpoint getting nearly all of them into some form of political romantic or military intrigue Active scenes illustrated the world and put it into motion largely through political intrigue and the build to warThis second book takes a mallet to what the first set up dulling and dumbing down the world and putting the majority of the characters into boring or redundant situations where they do not escape the inertia of wasted prose until the final third of the book Where the slow build to great promise was acceptable in the first the sharp drop into bleak and sluggish chapters here is deeply dishearteningMartins prose drops off noticeably Fewer scenes generate atmosphere and often it seems downright immature with subJK Rowling lines like The shame of that hurt worse than the pain and the pain hurt a lot There is no language in this volume that rivals the blacksmiths metallurgy or the dragon eggs in the first leaving the thousandpage trek much less worthwhilePlotting and pacing have suffered similar fates The first book took a few hundred pages to get off the ground but then flew into character development and action divvied up between a dozen or so lives giving us a sense of a full and cohesive world The narrative is divvied up again here but with different results A couple of characters are in intense situations one girl poses as a boy heading to an army garrison with a questionable guide and the possibility of being attacked by the enemy at any time on her attempt to get home and a young soldier has gone to the other side of the wall and is risking facing creatures and perils never written about in the span of his homelands culture They should have this volume to themselves but instead we spend the first half waiting to hear more about them while we watch other characters sneaking into whorehouses and chatting about freshmanlevel theology Its especially annoying to leave someone hiding from enemy troops so you can read about some guy we havent thought about for hundreds of pages is getting a blowjob Martins approach to sex is perhaps more adolescent than in the first book and definitely has less appealing placement While the last third expands the number of useful and interesting roles the book has far too many chapters that serve as dull blockades to worthwhile narrative These lowaction chapters are not artistic or particularly expressive of original opinions The Song of Ice and Fire seems like a prime franchise to expand into semiliterary fiction but rather fumbles over clichs of sadness lust and nonsense that are all strikingly less immediate than the situations we leave to read about them We do not need another conversation about how some form of magic or divinity cant possibly be real Five or six of them will sufficeIt ties into a troubling sluggishness about this book The first book ended on the verge of war with one major battle having ended The second book ends on the very beginning of war with a whole bunch of people arriving It ends essentially on the same promise of future progress that the first did and has so much unnecessary material that I couldnt help looking at my copy of A Storm of Swords the page third book and wonder if it wasnt bloated by the same problems UPDATE Storms of Swords conquered all expectations and was the best starttofinish entry in the series so far To read about what changed you can click hereIt stings worse because the first book ended with so many promises  NEW READERS MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH We ended on the revelation that dragons are real and three fell into the hands of one of the most tragic characters In this volume they spend  pages doing little more than eat as were informed that theyre weak and helpless and serve only as an excuse for their owner to go to a couple of fancy places The revelation of the undead in the first book is even more underdeveloped here Even the other side of the wall turns out to not by a realm of nightmares or perils but more barbarians and sad people  a nice literary point but severely underwhelming in delivery There were so many things to look forward to but they dont manifestIn short Clash of Kings doesnt have much clashing and the kings do little of value It would have been more aptly titled The Sadness of the People Who Arent Kings but that wouldnt have sold as well   Everyone seems to agree that George RR Martin and A Song of Ice and Fire are titans in the genre of Epic Fantasy True true Everyone also seems to agree that the best characters are Tyrion Arya and Jon Snow They are indeed wondrous characters They are heroes They fail many times but in a way they are infallible they are so incredibly sympathetic they are always trying to do the right thing they have kindness  empathy  bravery  loyalty In fact nearly every voice in the first two novels is of this type the HERO Sansa is one exception  however she is a victim and I found her perspective to be very uncomfortable But I found the tale of the novels other nonhero barely even an antihero to be particularly compelling Theon Greyjoy Youre the bomb TheonThe kid is an asshole a smug and irritating asshole He thinks hes smarter than everyone else He makes plans upon plans that seemed based entirely around the idea that because he is thinking these thoughts they will no doubt occur He is arrogant beyond belief He has an annoying selfpleased smirk whenever another character describes him He is a rough sexloving womanizer and he strings girls along In the first novel he kicks around a decapitated head like a soccer ballFavorite Theon part getting a blowjob while thinking about how awesome his future successes will be And then he climaxes as he considers how his great deeds will even overshadow those of his dear old dad What a selfabsorbed asshole I couldnt help but laugh out loudAnd yet he has positive qualities too hes no cardboard cutout He has guilty feelings of loyalty He is brave and quickthinking and is no kissass His rapid response time saves a childs life Unlike his men he doesnt enjoy cruelty or barbarism and actively stops their occurrence He is thwarted repeatedly and never lets that stop him He sees no point in the grim vendettas of the old He is not as they say all bad In Theon perhaps the nurture of the Starks has had some slight impact on the nature of the GreyjoysI really appreciate that Martin included Theons voice because honestly reading walltowall heroic perspectives is enough to make me want to cut some throats Theon is an asshole but hes the kind of guy Id love to get a beer with shoot the shit and enjoy his various meanspirited bitching and selfabsorbed plans of conquest He is seriously imperfect quite unlike most of the other voices in the tale   "},

It made me root for the death of a child and then despise myself love a hated character cry angry tears and bite my nails because of all the suspensePictograhically all of the above was happening to meI did not throw the book across the room Instead I put it aside and stared at the wall for a few minutes in grief and disbelief If you read this you know which part I am talking about SOBBING Then I picked it up again because at that point I was so hooked that nothing could have stopped me I also MAY HAVE cut my neurobiology class to finish it I know Im bad very very badAh you guys Look at you all innocent before this book rips into youA Storm of Swords is in my opinion an undisputed high point of the series so far It expanded the story in delightful wonderful ways It gave it a truly epic

loved this book because of the amount of promise it brought to the series It brought our characters to the brink of greatness put them in the positions that were surely going to change the course of this entire story   Ah our favorite despicable Lannisters Look at you BEFORE all the hell broke loose for you Does it make you feel any sympathy for the Starks now No I thought soThe character complexity parallels the story complexity  both are done masterfully The characters feel alive and real They are interesting and fascinating and fluctuate between likable and despicable in a not too predictable fashion  The previously unseen connections between characters and events are mindblowing And seeing the select few skillfully manipulating so many others is unsettling  Let me use Jaime and Tyrion as my examples here Dont get me wrong I gush about it but this book is far from perfect Just like its sequels and predecessors it suffers from overload of descriptions and repetitions gratuitous bodily functions and banquets Some storylines already begin to drag Arya for instance But most of the faults were easily overshadowed by the great characterization masterful story and wonderfully built suspense This is what I felt was unfortunately missing from the books that followed and what I hope they return to eventually  brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   its time

third book and its not like I cant say which book I like better which was weaker they are one long story that come in threeso far for me packagesIts not like Indiana Jones Where we say man I love Indiana Jones but that second one WTH  You know with Kate Capshaw and her never ending shriek and there were monkey brainsDo you remember the monkey brains I remember the monkey brainsRefresher  I will make no mention of Indiana Jones and the skull of shit or whatever it was called because I have decided that Harrison Ford needed a new boat and it should not be included in the seriesAnyways A Song of Fire and Ice seems to different from the other series I have read cough Sookie Stackhouse cough I find them very refreshing and I never have any idea where its going or how he is going to get us therealso do not get attached to anyone cause George R R Martin be killing bitches left right and center No one is safeConfession time I seem to have a crush on The Hound  WHAT Shut up I dont want to talk about it  Whatever I am not even sure he is alivethe last time we saw him he was feeling a bit stabbed under a tree and I am not puting a spoiler tag on that cause if I dont know then I am not

did not judge my hound problem so were good   HAPPY SEASON  FINALE EVE NERDIES view spoilerwhat an awkward fathers day present for tywin success i have managed to read this book without getting spoiled ahead of time so  ha to you nerds talking loudly in my scifi section about the plot i ran to the history wall and hummed loudly until they left ha to that jerk at BEA telling his colleagues every single thing that happened in the third book while he stood behind me in that justin cronin line i made greg come back from his boothbrowsing and hold our place he has read all of these already and i scooted over to the chronicle booth and peered around the corner while greg stood in line wideeyed and kept making no it is not safe yet gestures and all i heard was the phrase view spoilerred wedding  ha to all you irresponsible but adorably enthusiastic teenage reviewers of these books with your spoilery status updates in my feed i have scrolled through quickly quickly and managed to remain completely untaintedand man there would have been a lot to get spoiled hereand now it is my turnHERE IS A LIST OF EVERYONE WHO DIES IN view spoilerokay so that was a tease and i would never be that much of a jerk but now i understand i feel powerful stuffed to the gills with knowledge and i am so freaking amped for season three to begin because i cannot wait to see some of these scenes played outbut apart from thati mean this is the third book in a series so what can i possibly say in a review it is difficult to talk about a middle book without spoilers and the casual goodreader isnt going to read this review probably because there has been so much content so much context that it would make no sense to someone who has never picked up a book in this series before i was rereading some of my thirdbook reviews for books that arent just a trilogy and you can see the strugglehttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhow do you talk about something that is continuing for people who have no idea what you are talking about so i assume only fans of martin are reading this and you people know how good this book is so what can i possibly say so im just going to whitter on about some things i likefeel like whittering aboutoh dana i am so sorry about that thing that happens to your beloved characteroblique spoilerview spoilerand in searching for that image i rediscovered this site that has way more content than it used to and i got sucked in for about an hourhttparrestedwesteroscomwhich led me to this which is a bookone spoiler so careful uninitiated friendsview spoilerit is worth a visit to scroll through their archives i had me some guffawsokay but there were a couple of things that i didnt like in this bookview spoilerbut those were just minor flaws in what is otherwise a great book george martin is good at a number of different things for epic fantasy which is usually defined by action sequences and the largescale his books are so skillful at the quiet moments dont get me wrong there are plenty of HUGE scenes in this book but there are also so many small conversations that are seemingly inconsequential to the overall storyline but they go so far towards character development which is something lost in a lot of genrefiction these characters are vivid and their decisions mostly  see gripe number  make sense in terms of their positions and ambitions and survival instinctsand they will affect youi started reading this while i was rewatching the first season of the wire which is an exercise i strongly recommend there are so many parallels in the way that characters operate within the parameters of the game and their individual codes of honor and behavior and in the rises and falls of characters that are predicated upon such seemingly inconsequential events the long drawnout causeandeffect situations they are masterful and span seasonsbooks which is such a delight to a fanwhich search led me to thisand oh god i love the internethttpasongoficeandwiretumblrcomis there anything you do not have internetthis book is everyones favorite but for me i think i like the second book better yet i understand the feeling people have for this the great love and the great heartbreak and  oh  the way he takes things we thought we already understood from as far back as the first book about jon arryn and about tysha and hes all nahhhh this is what happened for real so very cool just when you thought you had closureit is an easy series to get addicted to there are some problems for sure some of the writing occasionally can be cliched and there is some repetition that is a little tedious but overall this is a characterdriven series that has great scenes of action is genuinely funny in a lot of places and the strategies of characters are worth it remember that as you struggle through the lyrics to the bear and the maiden fair for the hundredth timeincidentally i would read an entire series of novels featuring jaime and brienne on a road tripin closingDAENERYSi love her so much

of A Song of Ice and Fire  silly readers im not sure ive ever read such a collection of resentful reviews for one book one reviewer just decided to repeat the same phrase over and over and over again sorry Joel had to say it another decided to note that kids are inherently boring Kids arent clever er wtf sigh i suppose i can understand the backlash Martin took a longassed time to put this out into the world and then  WHAT THE HELL  reader favorites Tyrion  Jon Snow  Daenerys have dropped off of this books radar but i am also perplexed  despite the loss of these wonderful creations this is an excellent and challenging novel come on readers grow a pair personally i savored this book from beginning to end the intricate plot the propulsive narrative the intelligent worldbuilding and most importantly the depth of characterization that were all hallmarks of prior volumes are still in place and undiminished in this installment one of the things that is often overlooked about Martin is that he is a brilliant writer of quality prose his descriptions are not just lavish they are often quite beautiful he has an expert grasp of language the man knows how to create imagery that is by turns stark subtly threatening strangely enchanting morbid nostalgic and ambiguous the only reason the novel does not earn a top rating from me but really who cares anyway is because of an unfortunately heavy reliance on repetition  mainly of key phrases and dream imagery still this novel should stand tall as an excellent continuation of this amazing seriesfirst and foremost A Feast for Crows is A Story of the Women of Westeros because this is set in a medieval land that has very little wish fulfillment in terms of rectifying gender imbalance it is fated by its own nature to be an unsettling and unfufilling narrativeCONSTANT SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Queen Regent Cersei Lannister is this series chief villain and so it was with much anticipation that i approached her POV chapters they did not disappoint quite unlike the POV chapters from her formerly villainous twin Jaime there is not much redemption coming Cerseis way shes such a fuckin bitch as the saying goes she remains cold grasping machiavellian murderous and extremely petty she is also incredibly entertaining a villain in the Grand Old Style full of swallowed rage and sweetlyuttered putdowns and viciously cruel schemes she takes to drink and she lets a fellow viper into her bed which also allows Martin to indulge in an enjoyably laugh outloud lesbionic interlude she makes a classic mistake in allowing fanatics to arm themselves in the end she literally outsmarts herself and is the victim of her own foul trap best of all she is going crazy her dreams haunt her dreams of her death and the deaths of her children much of her villainous nature is explained by these dreamswhat mother wouldnt stop at anything to protect her children and so Cersei doesnt stop at anythingbut what i mainly took away from her chapters were two important lessons that i learned oh years ago probably in my various college Gender Studies classes first a woman in power within a patriarchal structure is a woman in constant battle with her peers she will not receive the automatic respect granted to men she will have to earn it whatever that even means she will be constantly reminded that her job is actually to marry and to bear children and that her position of authority is somehow unnatural against the natural order of things i despised Cersei but i also despised those around her who did not give her the automatic respect a man would have in her position i appreciate that Martin made this inequity crystal clear he is against Cersei of course he is  shes the villain but he also gives the challenges she faces in her new position a rather timeless quality gender inequity is timelessand the second lesson a woman who gains power within a patriarchal system by mirroring the gender essentialism that supports that system has sadly sublimated that structure as natural and right  and will therefore enact that chauvinism Womens Studies  folks Cersei does not challenge gender imbalance  she supports it her interior monologues are full of the same bullshit as any sexist dumbass she despises weakness in men she condemns slutty behavior while indulging in it herself she uses classic chauvinistic tactics to bring down a rival and evenmoreclassic male brutality to destroy men and women alike as i mentionedshes a fuckin bitch but her character is a fascinating one to contemplateThe Sand Snakes and The Dorne Princess i suppose the chapters set in Dorne could contribute to many readers disengagement with this novel oh whatever i love Dorne Dorne is the ugly stepchild of Westeros matrilineal and distantly threatening with a great big chip on its shoulder but what a place it is aggressive and volatile sure but also a land where women are automatically given the same respect as men where a princess is the natural heir to the throne where bastards are not automatically disrespected the brief glimpses of the Sand Snakes despite their inability to start the war they craved were compelling in how differentiated they were in their various proposals to begin battle and i also appreciated how fallible Arianne Martell turned out to be a girl unused to schemes but still scheming away a seductress who fell in love a woman loyal to her friends and disinterested in cruelty an heiress and misguided leadertobe one whose time in the limelight approachesSansaAlayne and AryaCat sometimes a girl has to literally convince herself that she is someone else simply to survive sometimes a girl has to forget the parts of her that make her herself in order to achieve her goals of course in one case this is a girl who has lived her life as a pathosridden pawn in the other case we have a girl who is slowly losing her humanity as she becomes a kind of living weapon eh so what they both have my full support go Sansa  Arya go survive this series you can do itCatelynStoneheart and sometimes a woman fails to accomplish her goals to protect her loved ones to save her children i imagine that some women can get past this and can go on to define themselves anew and other women cannot or do not they swallow their bitterness but do not forget it becomes their fuel their purpose for being it can turn a heart to stone and um it probably doesnt help having your throat slashed at your brothers wedding and then being revived as a monstrous quasizombie and so Catelyn becomes a dread avenger and not a pretty one she is a killer without regard to reason or even justice and she turns Dondarrions Merry Men into a grim and bloodthirsty cabal i never thought id see Thoros be so sad so lost i never thought Lemoncloak could be such an uncaring asshole i never thought Catelyn would hang an innocent woman or a mere lad well i suppose thats what can happen so i know that Brienne survives thats obvious but if Podric Payne dies im coming after you George MartinThe Maid of Tarth i saved one of my favorite characters of the series for last i dont think Brienne is a lot of readers favorite i assume they find her constant integrity and her equally constant naivete repetitiousness and lack of imagination to be tedious but thats not how i feel i loved her from beginning to probably not her end there is such genuine realism to her loyal awkward lovelorn character she is a warrior woman but this means nothing in maledominated Westeros except constant and automatic disrespect she is i suppose physically unattractive and is constantly reminded of that by nearly every person she meets she is always Doing The Right Thing that integrity causes her to be disrespected even more and it often means nothing to the people around her well it means a lot to me her quest may have been aimless but it was also useful in illustrating the true and awful tragedy of war the lives lost the tormented survivors the bleak landscapes the sense of a world turned dark and bloody and soulless  a world without meaning seeing such a brave person travel through this blighted landscape and continuously stubbornly mulishly trying to do good was hard to read  but it was also what i really needed in order to truly connect with this novel a hero tried and true her two fight scenes vanquishing members of the appalling Brave Companions were awesome what a brave lady and what a unique addition to the fantasy genres Hero Archetype i love her as i loved this booknow on to the next one   The context here is everything A Song of Ice and Fire began with the publication of A Game of Thrones in  Thrones introduced us to the land of Westeros a continent the size of South America but suspiciously similar to medieval England We followed a handful of characters representing various factions of the Seven Kingdoms squabbling for the right to sit upon the Iron Throne Its grittiness tactility fullyrealized characters and high stakes a major character loses a head gave it a cult following Two years after Thrones A Clash of Kings was published It told the story of the War of the Five Kings Though it started slowly it built to a fine ending which included the shocking loss of Winterfell home to many of our main characters and the epic Battle of the Blackwater A phenomenon had started Like clockwork the third novel in the cycle A Storm of Swords came two years after Kings It was the biggest book so far and easily the best It featured all the hallmarks wed come to expect from author George RR Martin  swordfights detailed descriptions of food casual misogyny laughably crude sex scenes shocking twists major character deaths and a humdinger of a cliffhanger  but those elements were heightened There are set pieces in Swords that are simply classic see eg the Red Wedding At the end of Swords the fate of several major characters  beloved characters  dangled in the wind Readers thirsted for the next installment They began their wait And then crickets Nothing for five years After five years we were given the present installment A Feast for Crows By this time it was nearly impossible for any book to live up to the expectations of Swords On this level at least Crows did not disappoint It certainly met the expectation that it could not meet expectations As the old saying goes the only thing worse than a bad meal is a small bad meal Not only did Crows fail to meet the challenge of Swords it was over too quickly When readers got to the last page they were left to wonder this is it Martin you see had allowed the manuscript for Crows to get so long he decided to cut the thing in half As he explained in a nowinfamous postscript Martin decided to split the book geographically rather than chronologically That meant that many of the best characters did not appear none of the cliffhangers from Swords were resolved and we were left to follow the dubious quests of various secondary personages To make matters worse Martin tentatively promised the next volume A Dance With Dragons would be published the next year That postscript was written in  Six years later A Dance With Dragons was finally released Thus it is a fortuitous time to review Crows It is a muchmaligned book buffeted by two competing elements the long wait before the book was published and the longer wait after In other words the book has suffered critically because it took so long to come out and did not satisfy the pentup demand It also suffered because it did nothing to alleviate the long wait for Dragons Almost all agree that Crows is the weakest volume in A Song of Ice and Fire Beyond that opinions are split Some people hate it with the light of a thousand suns Some people love it like a pug dressed in a tuxedo Others acknowledge its weakness while admitting that a subpar steak is still a steak The length of time it takes Martin to churn out his opuses creates some high passion amongst his fans That passion combined with the internet and thousands of basements belonging to thousands of moms has created a great deal of hyperbolic ire directed towards Martin While this criticism is a minority report it is loud and has colored the merits of Crows I am immune to this misplaced anger I am a latecomer to Martins work accordingly when I started reading Thrones four books had already been published with a confirmed release date for the fifth Ive never suffered the long withdrawals between books that the early adopters have had to overcome Due to this tardiness I feel like I can judge Crows based on its literary qualities rather than its late arrival onto the Ice and Fire firmament Unfortunately the literary qualities of Crows are in short supply Most of Crows problems stem from Martins decision to divide the story by geography and focus mainly on the action in Westeros that takes place south of the Wall That means that the dwarf Tyrion Lannister Martins greatest creation is missing So are Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen Not only are you losing fantastic multidimensional characters with whom weve traveled for hundreds and thousands of pages you lose the heart of the story As far as I can tell and Im sure Ill be wrong Martins endgame seems to point towards two events the struggle at the Wall against the onslaught of the walking dead the song of Ice and Daenerys struggle to reclaim the Iron Throne with the help of her dragons the song of Fire Neither of those crucial points get any play in Crows Instead its  pages of BsideThe viewpoint characters in Crows Martins story is told in the thirdperson limited with chapters that alternate pointsofview among various characters are mostly new to the spotlight Jaime Lannister Samwell Tarly Arya Stark and Sansa Stark are the only returning viewpoint characters The other viewpoints go to Queen Cersei Aeron Asha and Victarion Greyjoy Areo Hotah Brienne of Tarth Aerys Oakheart and Arianne Martell Some of these characters are brand new Some have been barely mentioned Most of them are confusingly named it gets a bit tough keeping Arya Areo Aeron Aerys and Arianne apart at least for me unfortunately Im not able to devote my entire life to these books With some exceptions their stories do not rise to the level of interest or intensity as the plotlines of Martins earlier books The bulk of this book nearly a quarter of the pages belongs to Cersei Given space to develop her character Martin is his usual strong self Earlier in the series Cersei was a terrifying enigmatic peripheral character In Thrones she showed her smarts and her cruelty by getting the drop on Eddard Stark admittedly not the sharpest tool in the shed After the death of her son King Joffrey in Swords Cerseis transformation began She became more guarded paranoid and megalomaniacal Her descent into madness is marked by her growing certainty that all her decisions are correct The most interesting aspect of Crows is Cerseis long fall contrasted with the rise of a fanatical religious movement called the Faith Cersei is also beneficiary of one of Martins weird peripheralcharacters the the fallen maester Lord Qyburn Like Dr Frankenstein Qyburn toils away in the dungeons doing odd experiments on living subjects the result of which it is obvious to see will be halfhuman halfmonster Unfortuntately Cerseis chapters are disadvantaged by a subplot concerning Westeros outstanding loans to the Bank of Braavos All the talk of high finance and trade federations harkened uncomfortably to another famous fantasyscifi epic that lost its way Cerseis brotherlover Jaime has the second most pagetime His evolution from villain to hero takes a big leap forward as we see him go from murderous sisterhumper to a canny leader pushing back against the excesses of Kings Landing With Jaimes chapters Martin is able to tie up a few loose ends still dangling after the War of the Five Kings for example the dragging siege at Riverrun is finally concluded The balance of Crows is told in scattershot style through the ten remaining viewpoint characters We barely hear from Sansa which is fine with me Still it is nice to see that she is developing at least a semblance of wit I have a major problem with her character mainly because Martin portrays Sansa as a real child that is as someone who is uninteresting and dumb The problem with kids as characters is that kids are inherently boring Kids arent clever no matter what I see posted on Facebook Only in a book or movie is a kid who cant tie his shoes crafty enough to turn his house into a living version of Mousetrap to foil a pair of robbers So far Sansa is realistic in the sense that she is dull frightened mistakeprone and hollow This also means she is a weak protagonist In Crows despite a limited appearance she finally starts to learn some of the finer points of deception Arya Stark is a more traditional fictional child Despite her tender years she performs great heroic feats Her evergrowing darkness however makes her a joy to follow I wouldnt be surprised if at the end of A Song of Ice and Fire we counted her among the bad guys In Crows Arya is exiled to Braavos She doesnt do much of anything and her chapters seem meant only to explore the islands of Braavos This wouldve been fine if Braavos was interesting Instead its just Venice right down to the swaggering arrogant handtalking menfolk Three characters Areo Arienne and Aerys serve to give us entre into Dorne The set up here  the machinations of Dorne against Kings Landing  is obviously important However these chapters are rushed and the Aerys chapters are so short and abrupt I have a hard time understanding their inclusion The same goes for the chapters with the three Ironborn characters Aeron Asha and Victarion In perfunctory style they are moved like chess pieces put in place for further development down the road The chapters following Brienne are like walking on a treadmill Shes given a lot of space to do things but she never gets anywhere Martin has her crisscrossing the ruins of a wartorn Westeros searching for Sansa Stark Of course we know exactly where Sansa is therefore we know that Brienne is never going to find her Also for all her abilities she is portrayed as a slowthinker a female Forrest Gump whos handy with a sword Even if we didnt know where Sansa was hiding wed have a pretty good idea that Briennes plan to find her would fail it literally consists of her wandering around asking where Sansa has gone These are structural problems And forgivable as long as the books quality had been consistent Its not This is a poorly written book by Martins standards His descriptions seem tired His writers tics are more pronounced The dialogue which had been whipsmart and eminently quotable is execrable It is flat repetitive Jaimes I love you too sweet sister is repeated on a loop and filled with odd obtrusive neverbeforeused idioms For some reason the characters start referring to their uncles as nuncles even though uncle had served just fine before In one chapter the insult stoatish is used two or three times as far as I can tell it means weasellike and then dropped like a bag of flaming pooDespite taking five years to write Crows feels like a first draft There are brief glimmers displaying Martins mastery of both his world and his writing For instance even though Briennes deadend quest is inert as a narrative Martins evocation of a warweary Westeros is captivating with its fresh graves burntout homes and outlawinfested roads Subpar writing can be saved by a propulsive plot or a great set piece As I noted before the plot grinds forward Moreover nothing exciting happens Swordplay is kept to a minimum There isnt a battle to be found in a way Martins exhausted effort mirrors the tiredness of warblasted Westeros With the exception of Moby Dick I try not to use the word boring in my reviews Here though things get awfully close to the bword To be sure there are a few saving graces The first is the sex scenes They are just awful and bound to put a smile on your face The highlowlight is a lesbian sex scene between Cersei and Lady Taena that involves an unfortunate comparison of a womens nether regions to a swamp It had me laughing my ass off Martin is also able to add a few twists at the end including a cliffhanger that leaves one character dangling by the neck Here unlike in Kings a strong ending isnt enough to save the rest of the book To the contrary Martin should take lessons from M Night Shyamalan you cant rely so much on th hour shocks or uncertain character fates At some point A Song of Ice and Fire will be finished Either Martin will complete the saga or it will linger forever as a partiallycompleted neargreat thing When that time comes it is very likely that the esteem for Crows will rise Its faults will be less glaring its virtues will seem more virtuous Right now though I just want to move on to A Dance With Dragons and pretend Crows wasnt half as bad as I know it was    Im not quite sure what happened hereAs others have mentioned Martin slows the pace of the story down considerably in this fourth installment of A Song of Ice and Fire ostensibly writing this as the first half of a twobook volume with a  year production time on each As such the book is by necessity filled with unresolved storylines AWOL main characters and lengthy travelogues where nothing of importance happens Of course this draws the inevitable comparisons to another famous fantasy series that started strong and became a sluggish irritating morass something to do with wheels and time as I recall The pace isnt really the problem here though as the story still stands on its own two legs The problem is the writingThough the first three books were extraordinarily wellwritten as a whole one could never classify Martins prose as elegant In this book he takes three steps backward for some reason and sounds almost amateurish in some chapters The book is filled with phrases and sentences that are awkward clichd and sometimes downright hackneyed Martins prose may typically be spare and to the point but I never audibly groaned while reading the first three booksOne of the biggest problems with this is Martins sudden inclusion of colloquialisms that so far as I can tell never existed in the books before this one Cozs nuncles and valonqars abound even though weve never read any character use these turns of phrase before and be prepared to hear groats referenced multiple times in a single chapter This doesnt only present a continuity problem for those of us wondering why these dialect oddities are so suddenly commonplace Martin seems to have run out of patience for phrasing things differently so the exact same idiom often gets used ad nauseum I was weary of these invented clichs before I even truly understood what they meantBy now fans of the series thus far are used to the disturbing ubiquity of rape in Martins world but even that loses what little subtlety it had in this book with at least two characters being described as needing a hard raping another example of redundancy in Martins writing did that expression really need to be used twice in one book The consensual sexuality devolves in this book as well Martin uses strange fixations and bluntforce descriptions the comparison of female private parts to a swamp was the high point for me as it were which make them seem almost bizarre and therefore a lot more gratuitous than they were in the first three booksI gave it two stars instead of one because the standout elements of this series are still evident in A Feast For Crows despite Martins apparent attempt to sabotage them with clumsy writing The characters are multidimensional unpredictable and welldeveloped and the overarching story is fascinating enough to keep me turning pages However I am genuinely concerned about the direction of this series which has heretofore been my favorite fantasy series and often recommended to friends I dont know whats going on with Martins writing but I truly hope the next book returns to the caliber of the first three I would hate to have to do with this series what I do with Jordans recommend that people stop at Book  and pretend its an openended trilogy Id much rather dismiss this one as the mediocre volume and go back to enjoying the series Heres hoping   Dear GeorgeHow do you do this lovely May morning Im terribly sorry to bother you but I really did think that I must in good conscience warn you of this problem I have You see I know many people who read these books and absolutely adore them Legions of fans Im sure you know that Really the books are quite high quality and quite enjoyable and whatever you need to do to get them to stay at that quality please do it within reason It has come to our the masses attention that perhaps waiting three to four years between books is a bit excessive Dont you think soNow more importantly than the principle of the thing Ive noticed some very unhealthy side effects from these gaps in between the books Namely some severe mental complexes that are resulting in a personal hostility towards you I thought I had an obligation to warn you that I have heard of several imaginative plots that many of my fellow readers have dreamed up to get you to finish these books All of them involve house arrest most of them involve chaining you to your computer a few involve terribly cruel things with assorted war instruments like those you brutally describe in your novels Ive heard a few terribly distressing things along the lines of shoving a broadsword up his ass Im sure you can imagine the restNow while I dont think that people would employ such plans now I do notice that these mental complexes seem to get worse over time So who knows in the futureJust thought you should knowSo toodle pip hope that put you in the mood for writing These people apparently think that such things willA sincere fan   "},

work out that November  was a Wednesday in   or  And  and  are too late for the technology described in the bookAnd whats Brandenburg about The blurb describes it as a British agent and a German woman find themselves unraveling a plot to bring about the Fourth Reich Maybe so but Joseph Volkmann and Erika Kranz dont discover what the plot is until past the halfway pointuntil then they are merely trying to discover who killed Ericas cousin a South American journalist who was chasing a story that had German connections My main problem with the plot is that it just wasnt thrilling I finished reading at the  mark when I realised I really didnt care enough about any of the characters to want to find out what happened at the end at a guess given that this was set in  and Berlin is still standing the good guys won A reviewer on Amazon said Meade doesnt give anything away until the last quarter of the book and this is what makes it intriguing Each to their own but I kept waiting for something to happen and I kept being disappointed On the plus side my housework got doneMeades writing is compared to Dan Brown which should have warned me off I dont like Dan Browns writing and I dont like Meades It goes against all the guidelines of modern fiction possibly because it was written before the guidelines were Its full of uninteresting narrative and long dumps of information that dont really seem in character the first conversation between Volkmann and Kranz was a case in point There is a lot of violence some of which is gore for the sake of it as it serves little or no purpose in forwarding the plot The thirdperson point of view flips between characters so much as to be confusing And not making the time period clear didnt help It has no Christian content at all despite being published by Simon  Schusters Christian imprintOn a more positive note Brandenburg is tightlyplotted although the profusion of cardboard characters that only manages to avoid complete confusion by focusing mostly on Volkmann If youre looking for a good modern Christian thriller Id sooner recommend Noel Hynd Don Brown who writes US Navy legal thrillers and shouldnt be confused with Dan Brown or Richard L MabryThanks to Howard Books and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review    This is my second Glenn Meade book and I enjoyed it very much I really enjoyed The Romanov Conspiracy This one takes place in present day but draws from the events of German WWII The evidence is sparse in the beginning and early leads seem to dry out The protagonist is not a Jason Bourne type but a son of immigrants who lived through the Holocaust He learned little from his father who was a young Jewish teen at the beginning of the war What he did learn was mistrust of Germans but particularly children of former SS officers Which is where Erica entersErica is a beautiful German woman whose first cousin was recently murdered in Paraguay He had hinted before her departure that he was working on a big story What she nor Joseph Volkman know is that eventually Erica would have become part of the mystery whether she had contacted the international police or not The players in the mystery are children of those who had made a pact years before There is a shocker in the story that the reader might see coming I did What I did not know until the end was if Erica was part of the plan or not It is a carefully laid out spy thriller Enjoyable read   I thought the plot was clever and story line quite entertaining I liked the character who turned out to be the protagonist although it took a while to establish his role in the story However the book could have been so much moreThe book was too long There were to many inconsequential characters which made keeping people straight difficult The author employed considerable violence and gun play in the story Unfortunately he knows nothing about either subject which causes his violence scenes to fall flat   and that is being kind The firearm related passages are so unrealistic that they border on the juvenile His dialog is reminiscent of Joe Friday speaking to people in the original Dragnet series It becomes so stilted in places that its humorous Still the story was entertaining and worth the read if you can get passed the shortcomings    I cant say I really enjoyed this book to be honest First off the writing style and use of language drove me insane One thing I kept encountering were sentences like Tell me what you intend doing Thats ones from page  of the edition I read While this may be correct in British English it sounds so jarringly wrong to my ear that I kept getting annoyed by itThe next issue was with the dialogue It was so stilted and characters kept addressing each other by name In general people dont actually use each others names a lot when they speak which is why beginner writers are usually cautioned against this Apparently whoever edited this book hasnt heard of that rule before  Now for the plotrelated issues The plot started off really interesting I liked the first bit that took place in Paraguay But then it just got boring mainly because I didnt really like or care about the main character Joseph Volkmann I get the idea he was supposed to be this somewhat troubled intelligence agent but the author didnt fully pull that offview spoilerAnd dont get me started on the utterly STUPID plot point involving Hitlers son First of all theres no real proof that Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal were actually romantically involved Dont get me wrong I really hate Hitler and think he was evil but Ive never seen definitive proof of this Eminent historian Ian Kershaw says theres no proof one way or the other and I agree with him on this But I digressSeriously this book is a bit long Save your time and read something else Trust me youll be glad you did I was so disappointed in this one that I dont know if Im going to read the other Glenn Meade book I got from the library The Romanov Conspiracy And anyone who knows me will know Im a sucker for anything Russia and Romanovrelated Something has to be pretty bad to make me contemplate passing up a book involving Russia and the Romanovsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   Glenn Meade in his new book Brandenburg published by Howard Books gives us a global conspiracy thrillerFrom the back cover A secret that must never be revealed

and Clint Eastwood also helped and it still packs twice the punch of most contemporary bestselling thrillers Whats more the cast of spooks turncoats and commandos who drive this story are more relevant than ever in our new era of special forces black ops and unpredictable alliances Aveam n jur de  ani cnd am citit cartea aceasta Este una dintre primele cri citite i parc am iacum n faa

ciudat cum am trecut apoi brusc de la MacLean la literatur de expresieAndrei Tama ianuarie    Im about to review a modern technothriller and while researching the author something jogged my  year old selfs memory of Alistair McLeanI gobbled his books in high school  I remember when The Eagle Has Landed was all the big rage and I read it sure like everyone else but Alistair had me hooked and I ploughed through his entire oeuvre or at least as much as our high school library budget allowed during one yearThen I forgot all about him until two days ago I suppose that will be another author that my adult self will have to ignore if I want to keep my five star memories intact   Had I reviewed this in my thrillerloving youth I would have given it five stars It is the adventure story par excellence the secret mission behind enemy lines carried out by a group of intrepid adventurers the snowbound castle up in the sky fights on the top a moving cable car and doublecrosses doubledoublecrosses and even doubledoubledoublecrossesHowever nowadays I find all such stories shallow the adventure rather juvenile and the Anglocentric view a bit nauseating Hence the three starsBut if gungho adventure stories are your thing you cant make a mistake with this   Alistair MacLean wrote the screen play for his close friend Richard Burton Burtons star power was sliding at the time of the film and he wanted an action film along the lines of Macleans bestseller and hit movie The Guns of Navarone And he got it The novel is in fact based upon the screenplay rather than the other way around  slightly oddI watched the film last night and I had to read the novel And it is the screenplay The first  pages are a bit slow since one really cant get the anxiousness of the team A team of British Special Forces commandos parachutes into the high peaks of the Austrian Alps with the mission of stealing into an invulnerable alpine castleaccessible only by aerial gondolathe headquarters of Nazi intelligence Supposedly sent in to rescue one of their own their real mission turns out to be a lot more complicatedand the tension climbs as team members start to die off one by one There are a few scenes that suspension of disbelief is necessary but they dont violate the viability of the story negatively MacLean understands how to write an action thriller and I would recommend Alistair MacLean to read any day of the week To give more of the storyline besides the book blurb would reveal the delicious twists turns and events that would destroy a readers pleasure     It was always going to be difficult to enjoy this book having just read and been astounded by the brilliant Submerged by Thomas F Monteleone As a youth I have fond memories of the boys own type thrillers by Scottish born Alistair McLean and on initial reading I recall that Where Eagles Dare was a first class pageturner Unfortunately revisiting this ndWW thriller after many years has not proved so enjoyableThe story starts off with a great flourish when Major Smith and Lt Shaffer together with their motley crew are sent on a perilous mission to the Schloss Adler a fortress high in the alps of Southern Bavaria There is initial intrigue when having parachuted into enemy territory one of the saboteurs is found murdered there is an enemy agent within the ranks We then proceed in a set formulaic manner as Smith and Shaffer proceed to infiltrate the fortress stronghold by means of a perilous journey on the roof of a cable car Their task it would appear is to rescue Col Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him and discover the plans for the second front ie the expected imminent Normandy Landings There is lots of shooting and a final confrontation within the castle when the true nature of Smiths mission is disclosed This is followed by more shooting as our brave heroes depart the bloody scene amidst chaos and a smouldering fortress that is fast being destroyed by fire and turning into dust and decayThis is a clean easily assimilated adventure story suited to the minds and attitude of teenage boys emerging from a youth spent reading the adventures of comic heroes Batman and Superman It is not really a book to satisfy the intellect or demands of an adult reader due to its simplicity and soulless empty characters It is probably best remembered for the  movie starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood with the immortal words Broadsword calling Danny Boy he said Broadsword calling Danny Boy Can you hear me Can you hear me It is also equally absurd as representing the German high command as bumbling fools who somehow allowed a small trained group of saboteurs to destroy a seemingly well protected impregnable fortress and as they escape are heard to say Gott in Himmel Theyve got awayPerhaps I criticize and reprimand a story that is simply there to entertain and not to be viewed as a well researched and informative thriller That may be so but in the final analysis I demand more from my reading than a routine adventure with a much frequented theme and a predictable conclusion   "},

watched too many Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone movies By the time I separated from the Army in  I had come to realize a few crucial things about the military and combat operations Beans and bullets logistics are everything The side that excels in running an effective logistical network might not win the conflict but it will probably at least ensure that when its time to pull out the troops theyll do it on their own terms See Iraq  For every soldier whose mission is to engage in active combat operations against an opponent there are five or more soldiers and civilians whose job is to get that soldier marine airmen sailor etcinto the combat zone and keep that soldier supplied and cared for  Wars are expensiveIn more ways than one Combat operations consume vast amounts of resources Money lives food fuel raw materials and so on See  The devil is in the details Effective organization and planning is very very important Without it you dont have a chance A soldiers life is not a glamorous one Mr Forsyth does an excellent job of showing what goes into organizing a professional and effective military force and combat operationIts a tedious and time consuming job He shows that a one hour combat operation involving a few dozen soldiers entails several thousand hours of planning and training The details that many have found to be tedious are part of war How much the details of the International Arms Trade has changed over the past forty years I cant say Obviously technology has changed However one thing that hasnt changed is the side that has the best chance of winning is the side that is the best equipped organized and led  The Dogs of War isnt a Tom Clancy novel Its a nonsentimental look at a military operation Albeit a mercenary operation It might be a little dry but then so is real life    Its been a lot of years since I last saw any part of the movie  more since I read it but it aged very well As usual Forsyth takes us through a long convoluted setup that is fascinating very much the same structure as The Day of the Jackal The epilogue explains a lot but well I cant say without a huge spoiler Motivations that dont make sense will trust meWhile most of my shelf choices are obvious I put it on the mysterythriller shelf because it has a lot of that in it Who is doing what  why is often a question Plus theres a scene that would have made Luca Bragi of The Godfather proudThe setup of the novel is wonderful Theres nothing magical or easy about planning or staging this operation  the descriptions of the operations people  scenery read as if they were real Its practically a text book for staging a revolution just as The Day of the Jackal was for assassinations This last sentence was mine but the Wikipedia articles for the book has almost the exact same sentence at the bottom Great minds think alikeI really liked the  movie starring Christopher Walken  Tom Berenger httpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsbut it isnt nearly as good as the novel because there were a few critical changes that sucked a lot of the juice out of it If youre familiar with both spoilers abound for both Id recommend reading the Wikipedia entries Heres the one for the bookhttpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsCompare the story to the one above for the movie Huge difference that even Christopher Walken couldnt make up CAT Shannon is SO much more interesting than Jamie ShannonVery well read although I didnt like the English voice at first Davidsons voice  inflections really fit the story though stars  highly recommended   Oh man After almost  years of reading and enjoying Forsyths globetrotting espionagemystery thrillers I knew I was bound to come across a clunker and this ones it In a way this book is similar to his deservedly acclaimed Day of the Jackal in that in concerns the plot and execution of a serious crime for political gain While Jackal is about the assassination of French President Charles De Gaulle Dogs of War concerns the attempted coup detat of a small fictional African country in order for a British mining company to take advantage of the countrys seemingly endless supply of platinum In order to do this the company hires mercenaries to invade the country and depose its dictator Sounds like a great yarn right WRONG Great idea for a story horrible execution First of all Forsyth seems to have come across the problem that makes Tom Clancys books so insufferable endless monotonous details about a the planning and execution of an operation We get it Freddie you did your research Now how about some interesting characters and dialogue How about some suspense maybeWhile Day of the Jackal went into great detail about certain aspects of planning for the operation it was on a much smaller scale and therefore much easier to take in Here its torture Also Jackal told its story from the point of view of both the assassin and the police chasing him Its a fantastic catandmouse thriller Here theres nobody to root for Its incredibly dull The book does have its rare moments and I particularly enjoyed the twist ending But other than thatmehForsyth wrote great novels before this one Day of the Jackal The Odessa File He also wrote many great novels since The Negotiator The Deceiver The Fourth Protocol Icon among others Also his short story collection No Comebacks is definitely worth checking out But he seemed to be sleepwalking through this one    In keeping with my usual practice for books Ive only read in a Readers Digest condensed version Im not presuming to review or rate this one However I do want to post an interesting background factoid Zangara the fictional African nation that serves as the setting here was directly modeled on the reallife country of Equatorial Guinea which Forsyth visited just before writing the book and psychotic President Kimba is a fictionalized version of EGs first president Macias Nguema whose dictatorial reign of terror  was ended by his overthrow and execution The country is still a hotbed of tyranny paranoia and corruption and The Dogs of War is still a banned book there    A classically Forsyth book The Dogs of War or How to take over a small WestAfrican country with a gang of wellarmed friends  is ninetenths description to the reader of the meticulous planning that goes into pulling off something big and impressive The plotting is extremely sophisticated and tension is kept high as our notparticularlysympathetic protagonist Cat Shannon is fixed to a tight schedule by ruthless employers The final tenth of the book is needless to say some frenetic chaotic violence which in the nature of violence never goes entirely according to planSo I liked the plotting I loved the sheer level of realism on display throughout the novel Which is hardly surprising since it turned out Freddy was indeed helping to plan a coup in Equatorial Guinea when he was researching the novel httpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsThe characters themselves dont really develop over the course of the novel  character development having been eschewed for greater focus on plot  but I still found the interactions between them extremely rich and entertaining The rough camaraderie of Cats gang of mercenaries the greasy greedy manipulativeness of Manson and Endean virtually any of the interviews with the numerous arms dealersIn such a novel there are of course points where for you the pacing will slow a little And the huge significance attached to the acquirement of some ammunition can leave one a little impatient when youre used to novels where ammunition is a given and people just fire the damn guns already However perseverance required does pay out and the book has a very strong ending Its also enjoyable to look back and reflect on the sheer volume of highly useful information about organising massive violence that youve taken away from this book Almost unsettling really Almost   "},

Through her contemporary investigation she stumbles onto a trail of longhidden family secrets that connect her toSarah Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girls ordeal from that terrible term in the Vel dHiv to the camps and beyond As she probes into Sarahs past she begins toquestion her own place in France and to reevaluate her marriage and her life It should never be forgottenBy Sol TetelbaumReview Sarahs Key by Tatiana de Rosnay Almost a hundred readers published their reviews on Tatiana de Rosnays novel Sarahs Key Most of them rated the book in four or five stars but some of them calling the novel mediocre showed a lower rating  three stars It is necessary to admit that their opinions werent unfounded and most critical comments were fair However from my standpoint despite the fair critical comments I dont think it is necessary to list them the novel deserves a rather high rating and I will try to explain why The book is devoted to the Holocaust The author describes two stories One story is about the tragedy of a Jewish girl named Sarah The story is based on historical fact In  on the orders of German military authorities French police brutally arrested all Jewish families in Paris Almost all of them perished in concentration camps The second parallel story is about an American journalist Julia Jermond who writing an article about Vel dHivs roundup found out many horrible details of this crime committed by French police France wanted to forget about its antihuman past and thoroughly concealed it The author reminds us of those tragic facts I am not going to retell the stories They are already well known but the book gave birth to some of my thoughts In her novel the author writes with anxiety and great concern that people want to forget about the Holocaust One character of the book says Bringing back the past is never a good idea especially whatever happened during the war No one wants to be reminded of that nobody wants to think about that The book demonstrates that such amnesia can be deadly For a long time nave people believed that the world moves in the direction of higher level of humanization In their naivety they missed the point when one of the most horrible and bloodthirsty variety of anthropoids resembling humans became active Russian anthropoids captured power in the Soviet Russia invented concentration camps and killing over a million innocent people yearly Over a period of  years they killed at least  million maybe more Then World War II broke out and the world forgot about the  million innocent victims  Humanlike anthropoids appeared in other countries and people continued to believe that they were ordinary criminals Peoples beliefs melted like a piece of paper in acid when the terrifying truth about fascist factories of deaths became known People couldnt believe what they learned Using modern technology fascist anthropoids made the killing of humans a branch of industry For human beings the Holocaust is impossible to understand it is just unexplainable And the only way to prevent it from happening again is to never forget it The reviewed book is multidimensional emotionally written but unfortunately as it has been mentioned in some reviews it has weak points as well Nevertheless I was impressed with the book its main message makes the readers think and this is a sign of good literature The advantage of the book is in the strong civic position of the author that I think has made the book a bestseller  This book is about events which were not wideknown it reminds people about the necessity to be alert Otherwise the modern anthropoids will commit a new Holocaust and now all people can become their victims They already are trying to convince us that there is nothing to remember there wasnt a Holocaust at all  In general the book is well written and authors voice is strong In my opinion the book deserves not less than four stars  Everybody who cares about human life who reads books not just for entertainment will read this book with interest and will continue to return to it in hisher mind Sol Tetelbaum    I was intrigued by the plot for this book A young girl locks her brother in a cupboard at their apartment in Paris before the Police at the behest of the Nazis take away her and her family They wait for several days in a detention center in conditions like the Superdome before being sent to camps in Southern France and we wonder if she will retrieve her little brother before he dies or starves or hopefully is rescued Unfortunately another storyline involving a two dimensional American woman whining about her insensetive French husband comes in every other chapter and the mediocre writing makes what could have been an interesting story less than satisfying    October  rereading this book again for another book club I hope I like it better than the st time but so far Im not seeing it Why would she use a word like ingurgitating when you can say ate That kind of writing irritates me a lot The true story is heartbreaking and very interesting but her writing just doesnt impress me as expressing the true horrors experienced by the deported Jews or any real feeling for Julias anger at her husband disdainful treatment of her Spring  Predictable story pedestrian  predictable writing None of the plot surprises were surprising I felt I wasted my time on this book selected for a book club I belong to   spoilers Lots of spoilers Dont read thisdisclaimer This is a review of the book Sarahs Key and not the Holocaust I give the Holocaust negative infinity stars if you were wonderingFuck you Sarahs Key you manipulative sonofabitching asshole How dare you make me feel like this at Christmas Dead baby brother in a cupboard Really Gassing the parents at Auschwitz wasnt enough I dont give a goddamn what you throw at me for the rest of the story I WILL NOT CRY AFTER THAT BULLSHIT I know thats all you want and youre not going to get it Not from meNone of the miserable crap in this story would even happen Heres Sarah and her little brother as the police are banging on the door and taking the whole family away for being JewishShe grabbed him but he wriggled out of her grasp and slithered into the long deep cupboard hidden in the surface of the wall of their bedroom The one they played hideandseek in They hid there all the time locked themselves in and it was like their own little house Maman and Papa knew about it but they always pretended they didntDo they make cupboards that lock from the inside No If youve got two kids who like to play in a cupboard with a lock do you let them play in it with the key so they can lock each other in No You unlock it and hide the key Duh If the police come for you and you want to protect your brother even if you think youre coming back in the morning do you lock your brother in there for the night No No one would do that Not even a yearold Youd just close him in If the police try to open a cupboard to look inside and its locked theyre going to make you unlock it In times of extreme fear does a yearold kid decide to stay in a cupboard instead of going with their parents No   Then on top of all that were supposed to believe that a new family moves into the apartment right after the old family leaves and no one smells the rotting child in the cupboard Have you ever had a mouse die under your refrigerator A raccoon die under your porch Right But lets just assume that the family doesnt smell it Maybe they dont have noses They would still probably pick the lock so they could USE THE CUPBOARD in their goddamn new apartment The whole premise of the whole plot is just one flaw after another And then that terrible poem at the end WHYNot to mention the halfassed chicklit nitwit character I couldnt care less about Fucking Julia I wish she would die in a locked cupboard She takes up most of the book with her idiotic pregnancy and her arrogant French husband How refreshing An arrogant Frenchman Where on earth did the author come up with thatOk Ok Obviously this book made me really really mad and I gave it two stars which is kind of weird But heres why The Sarah part of the story was really quite good I learned about the Vel dHiv Roundup which is interesting and upsetting and Id never even heard of It made me feel awful and guilty and pissed off but it made me FEEL And thats somethingI shed one small tear at the very end totally against my will DAMMIT When she named the baby Sarah even though I saw it coming a mile away and I hated her anyway so why do I care URRGH I hated Julia not the baby Im sure the baby was sweet   I finished Sarahs Key this morning and I have so many thoughts going through my head about it I loved the pacing of the story how it switched between Sarahs story and Julias story up until the point where the two merged I loved how the style of Sarahs story was completely different than the style of Julias story I loved how both stories made me cry even though I knew what was coming I loved how realistically the characters were portrayed Nobody was all good or all bad just human with human frailties I loved the depictions of the small acts of conscience and kindness I had no idea about the roundups of Jews in France I did know that the Nazis tended to just send children who were too young to work straight to the gas chambers I think the author did a good job of illustrating why the French people seemed to forget what had happened and how the Holocaust indirectly affected them I hope writers continue writing stories like Sarahs Key that bring the atrocities of the Holocaust to light so we can learn and not repeat those mistakes   "},

"author": "Rudolf Hss",
"text": "SS Kommandant Rudolph Hss  was historys greatest mass murderer personally supervising the extermination of approximately two million people mostly Jews at the death camp in Auschwitz Poland Did I give this book five stars because I agree with what he did With the persecution of Jews homosexuals gypsies etc With the slaughter of millions of lives Of course not The book deserves five stars because it gets you into the mind of a cruel man who can carry out cruel actions and still be able to play the martyr In this book you will heard countless times how it wasnt Hoesss fault How he was always striving for the best he could get his prisoners How hard he was done by He even goes as far as to suggest that the work his prisoners had to do day in and day out was good for them it kept them psychologically sane At times it even felt like he was trying to vilify the prisoners in the sonderkommandoThis book was truly horrific in content and at times I simply couldnt believe what I was reading Was I supposed to just accept that the extermination of millions of people was just your typical job Hoess in clever in the way he builds up his story so that it flows into a logical way of thinking But his little tricks wont work on any selfthinking human being He can say as many times as he likes that being the commandant meant that he wasnt directly responsible for the disgusting conditions of prison life or the gassing of prisoners He can blame Himmler all he likes for making the orders nothing but orders He is not apologetic for what he did and the only thing he does regret is getting caught I recommend this book for anyone interested in WW in the running of a concentration camp or for those who want to understand what goes through the mind of evil Hoess is a definite liar with his thoughts and feelings but at least he was honest with fact    Because you cant give a Nazi  starsRudolph Hosss memoirs are perhaps the most important document attesting to the Holocaust because they are the only candid detailed and essentially honest description of the plan of mass annihilation from a highranking SS officer intimately involved in the carrying out of Hitlers and Himmlers plan from the books preface I think that is a pretty accurate depiction of what this book is Hoss was forthright in conveying his own personal history his role in the Nazi machine and his position as Kommandant of Auschwitz His formative years during WWI his  years in prison and his early years in the SS all led up to the position he would be most notorious for I learned a lot about SS hierarchy especially in regards to concentration camp administration The prewar and prefinal solution camps were mainly for political prisoners ENEMIES OF THE STATE They eventually evolved to become death factories as Hoss reflected who could imagine the horrible tasks that would be assigned to the concentration camps during the war When he was finally given the assignment to establish and build Auschwitz he adamantly vented his frustration toward his subordinates A person can fight active opposition but is powerless against passive resistance He was definitely an ifyouwantsomethingdonerightyouhavetodoityourself kind of guy The worst possible fate for a Jew at Auschwitz would be Sonderkommando herding fellow Jews into gas chambers removing the bodies liberating them of their gold teeth and hair and feeding the corpses into the furnaces It often happened that Jews from the Sonderkommando discovered close relatives among the bodies dug up after being in mass graves and even among those who went into the gas chambers Good Lord Hoss seemed remorseful when recalling the atrocities he witnessed though he admitted he had to maintain a fiercely indifferent faade and portray himself as unaffected He was responsible for developing Zyklon B which would be the vehicle that allowed the Nazis to fulfill the Final Solution at such a rapid pace And he stood by as millions were led into the gas chambers His excuse follows the typical Nazi adage that they were just following orders Hoss was a man who needed something to believe in and more importantly someone to tell him what to do from epilogueHis own account and especially his final letters to his family almost make him sympathetic ALMOST No doubt he was monstrous but there is a sense of humanity beneath his Nazi uniform and ideology His complicacy in spilling the beans to prosecutors attests to that Hoss was one of the few who could and also would give precise information about every aspect of the mass killings In fact he answered everything asked of him No doubt this is a historically significant book It also offers supplementary material like Hosss recollections of his collegues I didnt read all of them only major recognizable players like Himmler and Wannassee conference minutes Overall it was a chilling if necessary glimpse at life inside the Nazi regime and concentration camps   Commandant of Auschwitz is a true account from the Auschwitz Commandants perception of all the events taking place in Auschwitz and other concentration campsIve had this book which consists of only  pages on my bookshelf for a while now It should theoretically be a quick easy read But it isnt My stomach was churning with every page The accounts of what happened sickened me I applaud Hoess for his honest recollection while in prison waiting to be murdered for the events in Auschwitz Not one group in the camp goes unexamined by Hoess including Jehovahs Witnesses Jews women and homosexualsA particularly disturbing excerpt from the book reads By will of the Reichsfuhrer SS Auschwitz became the greatest human extermination center of all time When in the summer of  he himself gave me the order to prepare installations at Auschwitz where mass exterminations could take place and personally to carry out these exterminations I did not have the slightest idea of their scale or consequesnces It was certainly an extraordinary and monstrous order Nevertheless the reasons behind the extermination program seemed to me right I did not reflect on it at the time I had been given an order and I had to carry it out Whether this mass extermination of the Jews was necessary or not was something on which I could not allow myself to form an opinion for I lacked the necessary breadth of viewHoess continues to describe in great detail the look function and activity taking place in gas chambers He estimates numbers killed which never made it to the millions because Hoess believed there was no way there had been millions murderedThis novel is an incredible firstperson account of Auschwitz I recommend it to anyone interested in the events of World War II in Germany   This book is as Primo Levi says in the introduction filled with lies and shirks but never the less it is an extremely important document of The Final Solution the extermination machine Auschwitz Birkenau the bureaucracy the corruption and the insanity that existed in the top ranks and among the SS in AuschwitzWhile Hss details his life from growing up until the end he intersperses the story with very important details on how Auschwitz grew how the subcamps worked he also writes about his family mass exterminations daytoday activities hardships etcRemember Hss joined the nazi party and the SS voluntarily And he is considered by many to be the most cruel commandant of AuschwitzAll in all as Levi writes Hss prejudice and idiocies stick out like flies in milk but viewed with a critical eye this is a must read for anybody who wants more insight into the horrors of The Final Solution   I read this book quicklyI wanted to read it but not to linger on it any more than necessary because I felt such disgust and dirtiness just touching the pages But I think its still imporant to understand the perpetrator mentalityand try to understand what makes people do thingsThe question of the book Is Hoss completely delusional and fanatical and believing everything he says Or is he diabolical evil clever and trying to write a persuasive account so that his life or at least his reputation be savedI have to say its the latter He writes articulately and with intelligence yet contradicts himself constantly and tries to paint himself as Poor me I had to carry out orders that made me sad He claims to not be racist yet spouts off ridiculous assumptions and insults He claims he had no other choice yet he signed up and easily extricates himself when he wants to These are clearly the purposeful and deceitful writings of someone with no remorseStill despite all the revulsion that comes with reading this bnook it is worth the read If only because we cannot be educated enough on the potential horror and evil that can burst forth in our world and come out of seemingly normal peopleDepressing and terrible yes But an educational psychological study of cowardice brutality denial and weakness That as well    "},

Hitlers forces are not stopped Russia will fall And with it the worldGerman soldiers call the battle Rattenkrieg War of the Rats The combat is horrific as soldiers die in the smoking cellars and trenches of a ruined city Through this twisted carnage stalk two menone Russian one Germaneach the top sniper in his respective army These two marksmen are equally matched in both skill and tenacity Each man has his own mission to find his counterpartand kill him But an American woman trapped in Russia complicates this extraordinary duel Joining the Russian snipers cadre she soon becomes one of his most talented assassinsand perhaps his greatest weakness Based on a true story this is the harrowing tale of two adversaries enmeshed in their own private warand whose fortunes will help decide the fate of the world GrippingI read this when it first came out in  It was an excellent read then and has lost nothing Many of us have read the historical accounts of the massive Soviet counteroffensive on November  and the encirclement of the th Army Mr Robbins doe an excellent job in describing not only the supposed duel between Zaitsez and Thorvald which is still being debated by historians but his ability to paint the picture of a city ravaged by the opposing forces is phenomenal He puts you in the heart of the dieing city Can you imagine the closets metropolitan town in your vicinity being decimated to hulks of sagging Ibeams burning timbers and crumbled concrete structures Yes it is worse than the current destruction we witnessed in Joplin Mi and TuscaloosaAla all weather related This book like the movie Stalingrad traverses every human emotion imaginable The fortitude of the Russians to fight for the Rodina not for political ideology but for themselves and the thousands of Russians caught in the grips of the Nazi war machine He also paints a vivid description of the invaders The arrogance has been left far behind Stalingrad is a war unto itself The once proud Wehrmacht is faced in a titanic struggle for what Will the battle bring them victory or will is be just another conquered city along with thousands of others Will the war end or will it continue to drag on taking with it tens of thousands other lives Only one way to find out Get a copy and start the journey to victory or utter defeat   Ive been trying to branch out in my reading lately and every time I do I get reminded why I dontThe reason I like science fiction and fantasy is that it tends to obey Eleanor Roosevelts dictum  Great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people  and chooses to discuss ideas above all else War of the Rats ought to at least succeed at the level of discussing an important event and fascinating people but it doesnt even manage to do that well Indeed War of the Rats was surprisingly bad at pretty much every level As military fiction I learned nothing about the character or nature of war None of the things that this novel is praised for felt in evidence anywhere in the text As historical fiction I didnt come away feeling like I had some understanding of the Siege of Stalingrad or gained any insight into the real figures that fought there As fiction the characters felt flat almost stereotypes suitable for a comic book perhaps but nothing else The female characters were unsurprisingly the worst and Tanias depiction was annoying at best and misogynist at worst and I say that as a staunch antifeminist As a thriller the drama never felt intense or exciting and the finale was an anticlimatic affair which failed to stand up to even its internal logic The villain character went full Cobra Commander in the end doing stupid things that made no sense at all even from the characters own reasoning as presented to the reader and which were completely at odds with the superhuman ber sniper presented earlier in the text or even with the characters own description of his plan of action For example if Thorvald knew that Zaitsev was accurate to  yards and he was he bragged accurate out to  yards why did he choose to engage Zaitsev from a static position at a distance of just  yards which he scorned as amateur earlier in the book and at which he also knew hed have no advantage over his enemy Why did he choose to shoot the fake position first when hed already determined where Zaitsev really was Shouldnt you shoot the real position first then shoot the fake second to be sure rather than the other way around Why having realized hed been given away did he not simply duck down and retreat to a better position  preferably one km back as hed set out to do in the first place The whole thing was just a mess that felt a waste of my time Maybe it wouldnt have been so bad but between Japanese Destroyer Captain Victory into Defeat The Goblin Emperor and A Face Like Glass Id been on a real roll lately and this just felt wholly unworthy I keep trying to branch out from what I know but every time I do I just feel burned Either the writer cant write Or the writer cant tell a story Or the writer simply has nothing interesting to say If at least two of the three were true I still might still be able to recommend the work but in this case I can only say that Robbins offers up a readable work that fails for me to be even good potato chip fiction   Finally I have read a novel by my former creative writing professor I can stop feeling guilty nowWasnt sure if I would enjoy it because it is a war novel but it is actually a love story masquerading as a war novel  kind of Also it was about tactics survival humanity good and evil and some very good charactersYet at the same time by the end I found myself a little perplexed regarding what it was about  it both began long before and ended after the supposed central conflict of the novel a snipers duel This offcenter presentation was very appropriate since war shouldnt be reduced to a simple high concept narrative but it was rather noticeable by the endMost of the problem is that two characters are given highly unsatisfactory endings which was not the authors intent  the editor decided to take out the last four chapters for mysterious editorial reasons they are available on the authors website When I get around to reading them I suspect Ill feel more satisfiedAlso I felt like Zaitsev one of the main characters didnt become really complex until about halfway through  wouldve been nice to get to know him earlierGenerally a beautifully written high tension characterdriven story by one of the nicest smartest people I know   If you ever seen the movie Enemy at the Gates this books premise is going to sound familiar to you Of course there is a logical explanation for that as it is based on a true storyor it could have just been Soviet propaganda but its based on somethingThere are four main characters two Russians and two Germans The Russian snipers are certainly real Vasily Zaytsev became famous during World War  in the Battle of Stalingrad the bloodiest battle of the war He was so successful as a sniper that he eventually started his own sniper school Tania Chernova was one of his students and lover The two Germans not so real One is a corporal named Nikki Mond who I think is pure fiction the other Heinz Thorvald is mentioned in Zaytsevs diaries as a main sniper in the German army that he had a duel with There is no other record of him existingAll the characters are interesting if a little bland I did find Tanias chapters a little annoying as she came off as a know it all and always sticking her nose into everything What I did like was that the book also was about the harsh conditions the soldiers went through at that battle both Russian and German alike It gets bleak for the Germans at the end which is expected considering the entered with  men and came back with only  Its a good read with some interesting things about the battle   War of the Rats by David L Robbins completely captivated me throughout the entire story This fictional book was based around Vasily Zaitsev the reallife Russian supersniper in World War II and his battle against The Schoolmaster who was sent to eliminate him The book is set in Stalingrad and is told from the perspectives of Zaitsev his female sniper trainee Tania his German enemy The Schoolmaster and a German soldier named Nikki Zaitsev is a Russian sniper from Siberia who is causing massive destruction to the German troops in Stalingrad He not only takes out machine gunners and officers but he sets fear in the German forces The Russian reporters are using him as propaganda to inspire the Russian troops and homestead as well as to instill fear in the Germans The newspapers brag about his ability and the ability of his trainees the Hares to shoot deep into German lines catching any officer or solider who shows his head to take a smoke or scratch his ear Zaitsev made the Germans feel as if they were never safe no matter how far behind their own lines they were German leaders realized this and hired the best sniper they had from Berlin to hunt Zaitsev down The book captures your attention through nailbiters and constant action on the duel of the best snipers in Stalingrad This book opened my eyes to the very effective uses of propaganda in war Newspapers and reporters transformed a solider from Siberia into a hero for the Russian troops The vast importance of shooting down this figurehead forced the German officials to fly in their own supersniper for a duel to the death Even though the duel would ultimately result in the loss of few lives compared to the huge battles and advancements from both sides around them the loss of either of their lives would be extremely important If Zaitsev had lost the German army could reestablish morale and keep their troops motivated while crushing the invincible feeling that kept the Russian resistance to the invasion of Stalingrad alive When The Schoolmaster was eventually killed by Zaitsev the message was sent that the best of the Russians was better than the best of the Germans When Nikki The Schoolmasters guide and assistant saw his supersniper defeated his whole aspect changed He noticed the lies in the encouraging radio messages from Berlin about the successes of the German forces especially when the radio station put on carols apparently sung by German soldiers of the Sixth Army The army was encircled by a blizzard and by Russian forces and were certainly not broadcasting Throughout the book you can see the loss of morale of the soldiers This book puts the importance of motivation of morale on full display When one thinks of the keys of success to a military one does not generally think of morale and motivation as the top choices But this book showed how that was a turning point for the success of the Russians in defending Stalingrad Zaitsev and Tania throughout the story used the defense of their homeland as their motivation However the only motivation from the perspective of the German solider Nikki was to return home He had to connection to Hitlers Cause and only joined the soldiers in invading Stalingrad because he wanted to go home as fast as he could Only the wealthy and sheltered German Sniper who was at home teaching and attending operas until called upon to kill Zaitsev completely believed in and understood Hitlers cause but even he fought just to go home When Nikki and The School Master are tracking Zaitsev they come across a German trench where the men are driven insane for fear of the snipers The Hares were baiting them out with rattling cans and blasting their heads off as they took a look The men feared for every second because if they looked they died but if they didnt Russian soldiers could sneak up on them like pigs in a pen I was unsettled by the view of lives as very fragile and very breakable but as unimportant individually Nikki hardly batts an eye when he loses two of his commanders and his supersniper as his ticket home He moves on as though he is a robot and it is scary that the soldiers build up such a hard shell to death In the end of the book the Sixth Army is encircled in terrible weather by the Russian troops They are hopeless and cannot fight any longer Many of them result to cannibalism or suicide The captain of the Sixth Army Captain Paulus is ready to surrender but Hitler in Germany forces him to reject the treaty and continue fighting He promoted Paulus to field marshal knowing that none had ever surrendered Hitler wanted the captain to commit suicide so that the army could go down with German Pride This disgusted me that entire armies of starving desperate men were moved like pawns on a chessboard in order to let others retreat further Instead of allowing surrender they were forced to continue fighting even though they were doomed so that they looked good to the public Hitler wanted to make sure the army looked good at home so mothers would continue sending their sons to war Meanwhile radio broadcasts from Berlin still told of the Definite victory that the Germans would have in Stalingrad This perspective of war intrigued me and stuck in my mind This book was also intriguing because of the mind sets of the soldiers on the view of death It was shocking to me how quickly a character was snubbed out and how short the reactions were from their friends War hardened these soldiers and the author did an excellent job portraying this especially in the character Tania Tania was a Russian sniper from America who had returned to her native Russia to get her grandparents to safety When she was too late she became hardened and shut out her family seeing them as weak for not fighting for Russia Her character develops as you see her go from reckless and not caring about anything but killing Germans to finally realizing she cannot be driven by hate as she starts to care for Zaitsev and form deep friendships with the other Hares After her reckless actions kill some of her fellow snipers her character starts to develop into one who finally cares about what she is doing and fights to defend her friends out of love for them and her country not solely for revenge and hate of the GermansI gave this book five stars because it stuck in my mind long after I finished reading it The perspective of war from the point of view of snipers was extremely interesting in the fact that they did extreme damage not only physically but shot by shot slowly killed the hope of the other army I was impressed by the way that the author showed that hopelessness was a real and terrible killer in war I was unsettled by the view of the loss of lives as sad but unimportant if they were not figureheads that could be showed off to the public as heroes I learned the effectiveness of figureheads and propaganda and how dangerous they could be and that fighting in defense of your homeland can make you stronger than those who fight with no real cause The unique female participation in the Russian army also interested me as I didnt know women fought as snipers and soldiers as well as radio broadcasters and communicators I thought that the author did an excellent job in character development as well as keeping the reader engaged throughout the book I recommend this book for anyone who loves action and war strategy and for someone who hopes to understand the life of a soldier or sniper in Stalingrad Overall this book was an unsettling but educating and important read worthy of five stars    "},

struggle with their own personal demons an American man makes his fortune in the Black Market in Paris Is this mysterious Chien Blanc Bens missing sonThe concentration of LIBERATION ROAD is on Joe and Bens individual wars Theres a very intimate personal feeling to their stories which makes this the sort of book that the characters are absolutely central to Theres little by way of coverage of the full horror of the Second World War to the local people or any acknowledgment of the rest of the Allies fighting There are some small cameos by two local French people in Joes story  a romantic attachment in particular which could be seen as poignant on the face of it but as it ends theres little opportunity to understand what war has done to those locals trying to simply survive in such

to DDay and follows the cast of characters as they slog through France Unlike most war novels which focus solely on the trigger pullers the three main characters in this book are a rabbi a truck

histria bem contada embora no possamos esquecer que o autor  jornalista sobre os bastidores da guerra em que o sentido do dever da amizade e do amor se misturam e que tornam difceis e dolorosas algumas decises Com um fim algo imprevistoGostei   This novel has been described as A heartwrenching tale of friendship love and treachery set against the exotic and intriguing backdrop of wartime Egypt and that sums up my own experience perfectly The Cairo Code will linger in your thoughts long after you close the pages Nevertheless I have argued with myself over how to rate the novel The plot gets five stars no question about it but I was not convinced the execution was of the same calibre in the early stages of the novel As a Christian reader there were also some aspects of the story that made me a little uncomfortable Based on the books publisher I selected this book for review under the incorrect assumption that it was a Christian novel But when all is said and done this novel got under my skin in a way that made anything less than five stars seem dishonestIn  Jack Johann Halder Harry Weaver and Rachel Stern took part in an archaeological dig that forged a strong friendship Four years later they find themselves caught up on opposite sides of WWII unknowingly pitted against each other in an assignment that none of them can afford to fail We know that neither Roosevelt nor Churchill were assassinated so to a certain extent we know what the outcome must be and yet the further I got into the novel the more urgently I needed to discover just how all the chips would fallAs compelling as the action was it was the emotional tension that had me propping up my eyelids with matchsticks in order to finish the book I guess thats females for you If I had to choose one word to sum up this story I would say poignant but I dont think that does justice to the depth or array of emotions I had experienced by the end I mean what do you do when your best friend and the woman you love and thought had died turn out to be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of the United States One things for sure There are no easy answersIt did take a little while for this story to get to the action so much so that I began to wonder whether the categorisation of thriller was really warranted This was largely because the author took the time to introduce several of the major players in the story not just Jack Harry and Rachel which in turn meant following several seemingly disconnected characters at first But it was time well spent because the friction between these characters and their differing agendas and personalities was a large part of what drove the action forward Once the assignment got underway any doubts about the label thriller were left in the dustMy main reservation stems from being a Christian reader and reviewer Having assumed this was a Christian novel I was initially surprised to find some rather frank acknowledgements of sexual attraction as well as several references to sexual activity outside of marriage including at clubs and brothels That being said there were no descriptive bedroom scenes and most direct references were limited to a few sentences within a larger scene The word bloody also appeared frequently as a mild expletive but this was the worst expletive used in the novel While I did not necessarily enjoy these aspects I did feel that they were true to the characters and the plot and I only mention them as a courtesy to other likeminded readers who may make the same assumption I did based on the publisherThis book was an affecting portrayal of friendship loyalty and the truth that there are no winners in war Thank you to Howard Books for providing a copy of this book in return for my honest review   Disclosure Reason for the  star rating Sentiment was responsible My dad served in the US army Corps of engineers near Cairo as support for theBritish effort against Rommel before operation Torch was launched Ive seenphotos of the sandbagged Sphinx the camels the vehicles and the general areaduring the war In addition I have fairly intensively studied the history ofmigration and naval warfare in the eastern Mediterranean which included Africaand descriptions of the archaeology over large parts of the kingdoms there Forthose reasons I had an unexpected background interest in the bookI thought that the author of this book did a very good job of portraying thearea the warfare the mechanical equipment and the social pressures of theearly s However an impartial evaluator should classify this book as aromance novel written for men as I suspect that the majority of readers whofinish the book will be menThe story of  kids who grew up together in the US one the son of a working manwho worked for the wealthy father of the other kid would be acceptable up tothe point that they were both on the same archaeological project in an exoticlocation and fell for the same girl just before the war and just as they werecoming out of their teenage years However for both of them to become militaryintelligence officers for opposing sides and be unexpectedly brought into directconflict against each other is too improbable except in fantasy fiction For thegirl to be exposed as a leading spy for the Nazis throughout the timeframe ofthe book and for both young men to be totally unaware of her status until theend of the book added an exciting and unexpected twist but also undermined thepracticality of a of an actual historical story line The fact that in themiddle of an intense manhuntevasion sequence the author kept referring to theidea that both guys were in love with the girl whom neither had seen for overthree years and both believed to be dead gave the impression of reading aboutpining teenagersNonetheless I thought that this was an articulate and well written book It hada fast pace despite having almost too many mundane details which requiredreading through Those details did provide a rich background for a very goodaction plot The characters and actions in general were very believable andwithout the fantasy romance overtones would have moved this novel more firmlyinto the classification of historical fiction This has no super hero charactersand no action grabbing shootumups There were chase sequences on open desertroads and limited action wartime violence which resulted in killings but theseelements were in character with real small unit war time actions   I received this book from Howard Books Blogger Program for no charge in exchange for my honest review The opinions expressed here are my ownBook Description The international bestseller takes you on a fastpaced nailbiting thrill ride from the Great Pyramids in Cairo to behind the Nazi lines in Berlin to the very seat of democracy as our hero tries to unravel a plot that could kill FDR and Winston ChurchillTo save the Western Allies he must kill the woman he lovesNovember  Adolf Hitler sanctioned his most audacious mission everto kill US President Franklin D Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill while they visit Cairo for a secret conference to plan the Allied invasion of Europe an invasion which threatens imminent defeat for GermanyOnly one man is capable of leading the defiant Nazi missionMajor Johann Halder one of the Abwehrs most brilliant and daring agents He is a man with a tortured soul and a talent for the impossible Accompanied by an expert undercover team and Rachael Stern the young and beautiful Egyptologist Halder must race against time across a hostile desert to reach Cairo and successfully complete the assignment or else forfeit his life and the life of his sonWhen US military intelligence hears about the plan they assign LieutenantColonel Harry Weaver one of their best officers to hunt down and eliminate Halder and his team But for Weaver as well as for Halder and Stern theres more than the balance of war and the lives of the Allied leaders at stakea pact of love and friendship will be tested in the frantic highstakes chase to the deathBased on a real attempt to kill the President The Cairo Code is a breathless suspenseful thrillera heartwrenching tale of friendship love and treachery set against the exotic and intriguing backdrop of wartime EgyptMy Thoughts The Cairo Code is the latest release of Glenn Meade and it is FANTASTIC The Cairo Code had been previously titled The Sands of Sakkara As a huge fan of Glenn Meades books I was so excited to have the opportunity to read it This book is a Christian Historical Fiction which my readers know is one of my favorite genres Glenn Meade writes with authority about The world in the s and s military intelligence for the United States Egypt England and Germany archeology The Nazi Party the concentration camps and the attempt on the presidents life As a huge fan of Historical Fiction I have found myself drawn this part in history and I find myself learning so much every time I read one of these books I found myself drawn into this book from the start and guessing until the end how things would work out The characters in this book are awesome They are very complex characters that arent always what they seem My favorite characters would have to be Rachel Stern Major Johann Halder and Lt Colonel Harry Weaver They are very complicated characters in very interesting and hard situation in this book The three of them are a love triangle and all three of them once friends on the same side end up all on different sides of the war Their love for one another definitely puts them all in very difficult situations and the interactions are fantastic I love Glenn Meades style of writing and I really felt like I was there on this adventure with our characters The Cairo Code is a Christian Historical Thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian Historical Fiction with high action you will NOT be disappointed I look forward to reading more of Glenn Meades books I give this book  STARS    The Cairo Code is a HUGE book that weighs in at nearly double the pages of most books I review Although publicized as a thriller I was approximately halfway through it before the action seemed to pick up The author spent much of the first half laying down background information on not only the primary three characters but others who played prominent roles as well I freely admit that there were several times I was tempted to put it away but persevered because I had committed to review itOverall the story is an intriguing one To me its chief interest was the bond between Jack Halder Harry Weaver and Rachel Stern and how that affected the outcome as they were pitted against each other on opposite sides of the war and their roles in the attempt to assassinate President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill The story itself was well written and once it finally got moving it progressed at a steady pace Although we know from history that the plot was not successful there were a few surprises in store before the endI feel that I should issue a word or two of warning I accepted The Cairo Code for review because other books Ive received from Howard Books have been Christian fiction There was no mention of the Lord or Jesus in the narrative More than one character engaged in intimate relationships outside of marriage Scenes were not explicit but were nevertheless not really necessary to the plot In addition those who do not like violence might want to steer away from this book also Again the violence was not particularly gory and would be expected in a novel about war The third warning is that apparently this novel was originally published as The Sands of Sakkara Readers who had already read this book might be disappointed to buy the same book with a different titleA copy of this book was provided for review by Howard Books a division of Simon  Schuster Inc   "},

"text": "Hailed as one of the finest novels to come out of the Second World War The Naked and the Dead received unprecedented critical acclaim upon its publication and has since become part of the American canon This fiftieth anniversary edition features a new introduction created especially for the occasion by Norman MailerWritten in gritty journalistic detail the story follows an army platoon of foot soldiers who are fighting for the possession of the Japaneseheld island of Anopopei Composed in  The Naked and the Dead is representative of the best in twentiethcentury American writing Us readers have no homes like unnoticed birds we perch anywhere like the most disturbed stalkers we go through anybodys underwear drawer like vicious taxgatherers we audit everyone the writers especially their creatures the characters very particularly and hanging between all three of us the book It sits there in its cover We ticket we note we award with our eyes brains and stars We scribble in the margins to the outrage of future readers  well I do maybe you do not do that I never mind if someone has previously done thatSo I have looked out of Humbert Humberts paedophiliac eyes I overheard the good man Jesus and the scoundrel Christ I declined and fell with Paul Pennyfeather and I closely observed Molly Bloom in her bed for at least three hours she didnt notice a thing It was like I wasnt there With Jeanette Winterson I too grew up in a crazy Christian cult and like others before me I could not stop Merricat Blackwood from her pyromania whatever I did Well you could all say similar things Our acceptance of the thousand varieties of human beingness is almost limitless We are promiscuity itself The Naked and the Dead is not really about World War Two or about war in general its about looking through the eyes of men a whole bunch of them sleeping with them eating with them drinking pissing and fighting with them In this novel the thing to have is a penis The testosterone floweth through this novel as doth the Ganges through India And I just couldnt do it I didnt want to go through all this painful stuff with a bunch of assorted blokes constantly eating farting sleeping waking yakking being blown up or not writing letters bragging playing poker theorising banally about women and on And onBecause there are a thousand characters Mailer provides each with a description round the time they are introduced Such asHe was a little over medium height well fleshed with a rather handsome suntanned face and graying hair His expression when he smiled was very close to the ruddy complacent and hard appearance of any number of American senators and businessmen but the tough goodguy aura never quite remained There was a certain vacancy in his face like the vacancy of actors who play American congressmen Well after several descriptions like this everything blurs together and you realise why Catch works so well because in that war novel everyone is a cartoon no painful attempt at ultrarealistic detail at all so Milo Minderbinder Major Major Colonel Korn and the rest remain intact in the memory years later But really me trying to read ND was doomed to failure It could have been a good one I guess you never know until you try heck Ive liked some funny things in my time But the signs were not good I am ferociously biased against novels written by  year olds and any novels written by anyone under  Writing novels is like the opposite of pop music Evelyn Waugh has squeaked by Decline and Fall and I guess you have to give Mary Shelley the nod too then theres Dickens of courseok ok MOSTLY I dont think people under  can write a good novel Norman Mailer is no Mary Shelley and he would have been the first to admit thatI hate war stories  Hamburger Hill Platoon From Here to Eternity I avoid them all I did watch Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line and like thats enoughI thought I should read this because I was reading Norman Mailers biography which is VERY ENTERTAINING but I just always wanted to be finding out what happened to NORMAN next not the boys in the jungles of Anopopei I can tell this is really a heck of an accomplishment he commands his material fearlessly thers no holding back hes a right knowitall and somebody needed to do a big honest novel about men in WW which could be set beside the big thumpers from WW there wont be any great novels coming out of WW So for me this was a  star experience from a  star novel abandoned a little shamefacedly but with relief   I cant recall how many years ago I tried to read this  probably  or more I recall hearing that it was the best story about war ever written so impressionable as I was at that age I decided Id have to read it My only recollection is that very early on there was a scene of such grim death and destruction that I felt physically sickened Coward that I was and probably still am I gave up the attempt to work my way through this tome immediately I noticed an excellent review from a GR friend and it reminded me of this unfinished task that of my failure to complete the book not that of recording my failure to do so So Im now asking myself whether Im man enough to give it another go I have no answer to that question at present Maybe I will in another  years   This is a book about America Its no secret that Tolstoy is Mailers favorite author and reading this book right after reading War and Peace gave me a good perspective on everything defined in this book It captures a uniquely American milieu of characters at a time when a uniquely american sence of Idenity and patriotism was being forged It spoke of the physical and intellectual challenges of various backgrounds through about a dozen main characters with learned empathy And in the end and throughout you get to glimpse all the indelible cruelity of reality as would be expected by for forboding titleThe book is also brashly written by a novice Mailer himself will admit his syntax tends towards the simplistic which lends the book a pageturning thiller characteristic that actually aides the reading experience possibly to the chagrin or the more established lit snobs What does hurt the book is some occasionally akward diction and character development for some of the books figures The hispanic sergant for example who is a capable if not confident soldier for some reason has an inner monologue that is written in fractured and childlike stream of consciouseness as if Mailer equated difficulty speaking a English as a second language with stupidity The crudeness of the soldier banter also can occasionally ring hollow especially given liberal use of standin euphenisms for censored swear wordsIn the end the book is of extreme high quality readable illuminating passionate and empathic It is well structured and mostly well written and in a couple places exremely influencial Im tempted to give it five stars but in the end I think the book maybe wasnt as beautiful and influencial as some of my favorite five star readsParting ShotsDid anyone else think the writting of Japbait was somewhat oversimplisticWho else loved that last line of the bookSo the Leiutenent admitted he hated Thomas Manns Magic Mountain but his conversations with the General really reminded me of Catsorps relationship with Leo Naphta in Manns classic   Executioners Song was one of the best books Ive read in the past year  so good I havent felt up to reviewing it  so I had high expectations for The Naked and the Dead The frontcover blurb from the SF Chronicle speculates that this novel is perhaps the best book to come out of any war which really jacked up the ante and got me intriguedWell I got only a little over a hundred pages in and IMHO The Naked and the Dead isnt bad but it is not a better book than War and Peace or The Iliad Its not even a true classic though it is a good read The Naked and the Dead was probably a lot more essential before we had access to so many war movies you can see all the war movie cliches already present though there isnt a black guy the troops arent yet integrated and Jews and Hispanics are the minority characters here I have to say that I dont think this has aged all that well You can definitely see why it was a bestseller at the time and you can also see Mailer was in his early twenties when he wrote this his first novelIts a welltold story and interesting but its  pages long If it were  pages or if I cared more or didnt have other options Id keep going but I need to get through my postProustum depression with something that really makes my toes curl and this aint itMaybe some other time It is a fun read One of my favorite things is how all the characters say fug all the time as in fug you motherfuggerIt does feel dated which is not always a bad thing   This is an amazing book considering it was the authors first published novel All the more amazing considering Mailer was something like  years old when he wrote it I picked it up after reading somewhere that Mailer actually joined the military during WWII in order to gain some life experience so he could write a book I really enjoyed Mailers writing style It was vivid alive and gritty Mailer describes the jungle in perfect detail You can almost feel yourself being smothered by the dense foliage and overpowering humidity Add to this the atmosphere of fear and anxiety that Mailer so deftly creates and youve got a great war novel Some of the flashbacks can become a little drawn out and at times it is a little hard to keep track of whos who due to the large number of characters I love the fact that there is no hero or character who can be seen as the good guy Mailer exposes each characters hang ups and dysfunctions and simply shows how each functions under the stress of combat and military life in general I can see why this book was so controversial when it came out in the s cussing graphic violence sexuality homoeroticism etc This must have been a wake up call for a lot of people who were used to the sanitized John Wayne style stories of heroism and clear cut moral divides Good stuff   "},

survivors have no time to rest on their laurels Almost before the last echoes of the famous guns have died away Keith Mallory Andrea and Dusty Miller are parachuting into wartorn Yugoslavia to rescue a division of Partisans  and to fulfil a secret mission so deadly that it must be hidden from their own allies The movie was great too bad it was nothing like the book which was even better The book starts with Mallory Miller and Andrea being picked up at an airfield in Greece The movie has only Mallory and Miller being pulled out of the sea by the Royal Navy The movie adds two Americans Harrison Ford and Carl Weathers which were not in the book The movie also omits one of the most crucial characters in the book Sgt Reynolds The rivalrybickering between Miller and Reynolds in the book add so much to the plot but the movie omitted it Alistair MacLean actually wrote some of the screenplays for the movies made about his books Unfortunately this is not one of them Although there are gaping differences between the book and the movie they are both great and I would recommend either to anyone If I had to pick as usual I think between the two Id pick the book   I grew up reading Alistair MacLean and think its a shame he isnt more well known today  believe all his books are currently out of print and there are none in the Northern Virginia library system That said he hasnt aged as well as some of his contemporaries but then neither has Ian Fleming He had a few really great books  mostly his war and Cold War books HMS Ulysses Guns of Navarone Ice Station Zebra Where Eagles Dare  and a bunch of real stinkers in his later career But overall both his plotting and writing style look a little convoluted by todays standards I can still remember my Dad being totally confused by the movie version of Where Eagles Dare  wait so is Richard Burton bad now or still good and this is clearly evident in this book as well In addition his characters engage in too much clever banter he really cant write women and he exhibits an omniscient POV that flits back and forth between what all the characters are thinking and which is considered bad writing today Also as MacLeans only sequel that I know of this story doesnt stack up against his classic Guns of Navarone Its interestingly set in Bosnia and so should ring particularly relevant today But he never really gives us a feel for the setting  it could be any European forest with a bunch of generic guerillas taking on the Germans One final note as with Guns Ive always assumed but never seen any supporting story that he intentionally named his mountainclimbing New Zealand hero Mallory in honor of George Mallory the famous climber who died trying to climb Mt Everest later conquered by fellow kiwi Edmund HillarySogood MacLean but not great MacLean  and so for anyone looking to explore this largelyforgotten author Id look elsewhere including Netflix   Im a huge Harrison Ford fan so its a wonder that Ive never actually watched Force  From Navarone all the way through I picked up the book a couple years ago just getting around to reading it because Im one of those people You know the ones who read the book because of the movie and vice versa as was the case with this bookI must say that having not read or even watched Guns From Navarone didnt deter me in the least After reading Force  Im definitely going to hunt for Guns and maybe even other Allistair MacLean books I normally dont get that itch where I simply cant put a book down and so read it in a short amount of time This one however I did WhyThe story was interesting and held me captive throughout Yes there are those unbelievable moments even the author says so in his storytelling yet it still manages to feel okay It was the characters though that I enjoyed the most I see a little of myself in Miller who is sarcastic Then theres Andrea who provides some comic relief in the form of quips about his new bride From beginning to end I was intrigued by these characters and the ever unfolding plot    After a successful mission of Navarone both Mallory and Miller who were the main characters of the book  go to Island of Kheros to pick up Andrea  an another important  hulklike character of the book who was there to get married with Maria But it didnt lasted long and form there their Journey began where they flew towards the Termoli Airfield located in Italy to meet the Captain Jensen who then briefed them about the mission and sent them to the Neretva to help the Partisans lead by Gen Vulkalovic who where somewhere trapped in the so called Zenica Cage along with the three Marine Sergeants Reynolds Groves and Saunders Six of them then fly from the Termoli Base to the Neretva reveal the secret behind why the Allied agents parachuted before were getting disappeared trapped there At first six of them meet the group of Partisans led by Dorshny after which they meet the German Army Captain Neufeld who then told that those people under Dorshny arent Partisans  they were Cetniks Now here these six men are accompanied with two more persons Petar and Maria  of which Petar claimed to be blind and Maria claimed to be her sister  but their actual identities are revealed till the end Petar turns out to be the head of British Espionage in Balkans and Maria was ferocious Cetnik fighter  Along with the escorts those six cover some of the distance in asphyxiated truck and later Mallory meets the General Bronzik the place where the Saunders die Mallory Miller and Andrea were quite sure that killer was Dorshny  which at later point of time comes out to be true But Reynolds consider that Mallory is betraying them which turns out to be nothing more than absurdityNow after taking the information they go back to Neufeld and Dorshny where they capture both of them and make them move to the remote blackhouse where they find the four disappeared Army agents none of them was hurt And then lock them inside the blackhouse but as part of plan he keeps the keys for the following Sergeant Bear who was following them which released them and then they followed the Mallory and the team And again they go to the same blackhouse and again captures all of them  destroy their radio and close them inside but again making some arrangement for them so that they can follow them as it was the part of the plan General Zimmerman who was the German captain was clandestinely hidden in the woods of south of Neretva Neufeld used to tell him by the radio about the plans of Mallory which in fact Mallory wanted Neufeld to send this information as it was all planned  Later comes the action packed climax Lots of brutal killing happens All the six persons go down to the Neretva Gorge after travelling through the old locomotive and others means Dorshny and the team followed them They tried to keep the Dorshny and the team to clung to the bridge where as at the same time Mallory and the Miller climbed through the ladder to the top of dam wall where they clamped the amatol cylinders on the walls of the dam As Zimmerman was not having any idea about what is happening he kept almost all his soldiers concealed near and to the bridge in the south which later due to the was totally vanished as the dam wall was being bombarded and all the waters from above  meters high fell down at the Neretva Gorge So thats how Mallory and team finished the mission being camouflaged in the beginning playing the part of deserters which later in the book Mallory tell everybody that Neufeld and Dorshny already were aware of their true identities PersonalitiesMallory A protagonist laconic person with the best presence of mind which appears to be quite calm and serene in the starting but turns out to be the best decision maker and one of the best Mountain ClimberMiller Witty sarcastic all the time The presence of mind  if sarcasm is concerned Is the best Some of the following quotes make it quite clear the level of his sarcasmJust after the Andrea got married to Maria  and suddenly they ran in the altercation which made Maria to leave Andrea andAndrea said moodily Shes gone home to her mother Miller glanced at his watch One minute and twentyfive seconds he said admiringly  A world recordWell there are just innumerable examples of his sarcasm and wittinessAndrea  Captain Stavros Well it projects the image of Rambo A hulklike personality he bears A berserk  which is always accompanied with acrid smelling cigaretteWell  in this book  Andrea made a quote when he was totally exasperated and knowing that Capt Jensen wont allow them to rest and as they wanted rest so he said the brilliant line Luck deserts tired manReynolds Groves and Saunders die at the end which gives the emotional touch to the dambusting action packed storylineOn the other hand hats off to Alaster Mcclaens verbosity and the way to express the tableau    Liked this book perhaps a little less than Guns of Navarone That was a pretty straightforward story this is so twisted that it seems like Alistair MacLean is trying to confuse you on purpose This book was a lot more like the movie Where Eagles Dare which I shall have to look for in book form to see how that is Lots of twists and turns and secrets kept from the reader and not a few of these put in perhaps just for the sake of being a twist and not really propelling the story anyOne other commentor said the banter between the main characters got a little much in this book and I can see what they mean It was acceptable but perhaps a little on the excessive side Also I cant remember Andrea having such a compulsion to smoke in the last book  where did that come fromAnyway  a not so bad way to pass a couple of cloudy cold March afternoons   "},

"text": "An entire navy had tried to silence the guns of Navarone and failed Fullscale attacks had been driven back Now they were sending in just five men each one a specialist in dealing death A classic thriller MacLean always delivered the goods I remember devouring all of his titles out of the library I wouldnt suggest doing them in a row because things can get a little repetitive But thats to be expected of almost any authorThe concept of having a team as the only way to take out the guns guarding a narrow straight through which the ships needed to rescue troops have to traverse is a bit forced But it does lend to a tight thriller with a clock tickingWhats best about this book is the interplay among the various agents and then the locals Betrayal and doublecrosses keep the plot moving    StarsQuite by accident I picked this up and started reading From the first page the esteemed war thriller author Alistair MacLean engages his reader Off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea the Germans and Italians control a cluster of islands and the area shipping lanes On one island  British soldiers are trapped and will soon be attacked by the Axis Alliance The destruction of the mighty Guns of Navarone is the only hope these Brits have It is a suicide mission The guns are protected by both nature and man in their fortress But a savvy military strategist may have found the how and who to silence these great guns Captain Keith Mallory is legendary The New Zealander is a renowned rock climber and knows how to survive behind enemy lines His faithful friend and his good luck charm Andreas is a Greek resistance fighter has no qualms killing Germans The young Stevens is proficient in German and Greek is also a great climber but is afraid of his fear American Corporal Miller is a demolitions specialist and Brown is known for his saboteur skills They have  days to scale the sheer  foot cliffs on the southern side of Navarone destroy the guns and get out before the British fleet sails into the Aegean channel to fortify the trapped soldiers After the climb that almost killed them the team believes the hardest part of the mission is behind them But the Navarone fortress proves to be as great of a challenge as the cliffs They have to choice but to destroy those guns Many mens lives are dependent upon their success And they will die trying to accomplish the missionMacLean is a master story teller with intimate knowledge of the military He served on a cruiser in WWII while serving in the Royal Navy His writing is fast paced with a great detail that does not bough down the story line His twists are like gentle waves They dont jar the reader The twists and turns just seem part of the story as its natural progression Mallory and his team are well characterized This reader liked and cared about them Often I caught myself holding my breath as I read the book In my opinion the  movie Guns of Navarone just put faces to these wonderful characters The drama is in the book Though the film is dramatic and viewers are reminded of the tight time line Gregory Peck David Niven and Anthony Quinn have The book is deeper The drama and action is more complete due to MacLeans wonderful writing    I saw the movie on TV back in the s Quinn Peck and Niven made for an allstar cast Finally I read the novel Well sir Im happy to report that Alistair MacLean could tell the corker of a tale The Allied saboteurs come through lots of close shaves still intact At times their heroics leave you rolling your eyes a little but the fun is watching them strive to carry out their desperate mission There are betrayals The pace is snappy the suspense builds well and the characters feel fullfledged I found myself looking forward to getting back to reading the war tale which isnt my usual cup of tea Your mileage may vary of course but I just wanted some diverting entertainment which I found here in spades    Tense WWII thriller about a small group of commandos that has to sabotage the naval guns on an island fortress that is otherwise nighimpregnableI think what I liked the most about this is its not got that modern action movie quality of triumphing in a series of outnumbered gun battles which gets kind of silly after a while Its much more about stealth and subterfuge The other surprising quality for me is the prose MacLean really gets you feeling like the wind and rain are lashing you as you climb the cliff that cannot be scaled or shivering cold as snow falls outside while youre sheltering in some remote mountain caveThe Germans are not all nasty and cruel which I also appreciated Its almost too easy to make the antagonists nothing but hardcore SS scumbags There are some scumbag Germans to be found here but the meeting for the Alpinekorps lieutenant and Mallory is pretty good stuff These guys might have been friends if war didnt put them on opposite sides and this was handled well Very good stuff all aroundI felt like I was following the action pretty well until the final escape at which point either I lost my ability to comprehend things or the narrative became much more confusing as far as how all of the characters got back together and sailed away Thats probably all thats keeping this from a fivestar ratingTagged with Maryland vanity because the lone American character who happens to have to do some emergency field medical stuff declares that one would not find finer care at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore Lines like that are why the Maryland vanity shelf exists   When I was  or so one of my friends at school Michael Edworthy used to bring this book along every day as a sort of badge along with his Who and Yes albums He couldnt have been reading it otherwise hed have finished it rapidly We were all careful never to mention the book in case he went on about it like he did about the bands Intrigued I bought a copy and read the first of the many Alistair MacLean books I was to devour

difference between left and right forward and backward up and down However for us there is a substantive difference between up and down because we live in the spatial vicinity of a massive object  the earth  which exerts a gravitational pull on usAnd in spacetime there should be no material difference between past and future But for us there is a substantive difference because we live in the temporal vicinity of a massive event  the Big Bang  which gave rise to the arrow of timeOr so Sean Carroll argues in From Eternity to Here The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time He says that the reason we remember the past and not the future the reason effects always follow causes and never vice versa the reason we perceive time always moving in a particular direction is because of entropy For whatever reason physicists collectively shrug their shoulders the Big Bang was an extremely lowentropy event and ever since entropy has been increasing and pulling the arrow of time with it Even if the arrow were to somehow reverse and run time backwards supposedly we would still remember the lowentropy direction as the past and feel we were moving toward the highentropy futureEntropy itself is an interesting concept one that most of us are taught in high school physics class is synonymous with disorder But thats not really what it is  entropy measures the number of microstates corresponding to each macrostate Basically the more possible configurations of all the particles within a substance the higher the entropy and the more likely the substance is to eventually reach that state After all there are many more ways egg molecules can be situated in an omelet than in an unbroken egg where all the yolk molecules must cluster together and the albumin and the shell and so forth Its just statistics that any given egg is likely to end up in the highentropy condition And another name for these statistics is the Second Law of ThermodynamicsSince everything is far more likely to be in a highentropy condition than a low one it remains a mystery why the universe currently has relatively low entropy and apparently had even less in the past Yet that seems to be the case and so we need the Past Hypothesis when considering the past we ignore the statisticallypreferred highentropy condition and assume that the closer we get in time to the Big Bang the more the entropy decreasesWhy Well thats the question the book grapples with because nobody has the faintest clueCarroll scoffs at popular concepts like the anthropic principle irreversible temporal systems and a symmetrical entropydecreasing Big Crunch as irrelevant or inadequate to explain the mystery Instead hes fond of the idea of baby universes spawned spontaneously from the maximalentropy atomic soup of impossibly ancient dead universes The creation of the baby would have properties similar to the Big Bang  inflation expansion low entropy an arrow of time and so on Maybe the reason we observe such crazily low levels of entropy is because our universe is just a toddlerAdmittedly this is a cool idea but its not really science Its not remotely empirical testable or falsifiable which Carroll freely admits And veering off into crazy metaphysical theories is fun and all but I mean we could all be brains in jars too or the elaborate fever dream of some minor god Who knowsI enjoyed this book though Its explanation of quantum mechanics was far more lucid and understandable than anything Id read previously  and it uses cats but more entertainingly and humanely than Schrdinger did Its speculations on time travel and wormholes and multiple universes gave my inner sci fi geek plenty to chew on And it introduced me to the concept of Boltzmann brains which was worth the price of admission in and of itselfBut mostly I just found Carrolls writing to be clear funny and affecting As an example the following paragraph which encapsulates everything I consider beautiful and fulfilling about scienceWe find ourselves not as a central player in the life of the cosmos but as a tiny epiphenomenon flourishing for a brief moment as we ride a wave of increasing entropy from the Big Bang to the quiet emptiness of the future universe Purpose and meaning are not to be found in the laws of nature or in the plans of any external agent who made things that way it is our job to create them One of those purposes  among many  stems from our urge to explain the world around us the best we can If our lives are brief and undirected at least we can take pride in our mutual courage as we struggle to understand things much greater than ourselves   This is a very wellwritten and entertaining book on our understanding of the arrow of time Entropy is a key concept which deserves and gets lots of attention The second law of thermodynamics states that in a closed system entropy can either stay the same or increaseit cannot decrease Sean Carroll shows why the reversibility of physics at the particle level gives rise to a seeming paradox if the physics of particles is just as correct with time switched backwards why cant entropy decrease Carroll discusses this issue at lengthI have often wondered if the universe were to start contracting at some point for example if dark energy did not exist causing inflation to accelerate wouldnt entropy start decreasing then Just as I was getting annoyed that the answer wasnt forthcoming Carroll started addressing this very issue He explained that a calculation of entropy requires including gravitational fields especially in the realms of lumpy matter For example the single supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy contains more entropy than all of the rest of the universe combined excluding other black holesToward the end of the book Carroll starts to wander into speculation he clearly states that his opinion is a minority opinion but that it is just as well supported as other ideas The central question that he raises is this if the entropy of the universe is still relatively low but always increases then at an earlier stage the entropy of the universe must have been much much lower still So how did the entropy get that way so very very low compared to what it would be if the universe were in equilibrium It is a very important question in cosmology but I wont spoil your reading by giving away the answer here Read the book and discover a truly interesting but highly speculative explanation of this conundrum    If I could I would give  stars to the first half of this book and  to the second For the first  pages or so in the iBook version I was enthralled by Carrolls exceptional ability to lay down the fundamentals of physics and cosmology in clear straightforward language with simple but highly effective illustrations This book has by far the best description of general relativity especially the equivalence principle for the nonphysicist that I have ever encountered His explanation of dark matter and vacuum energy is also brilliantI was all mixed up on those concepts before I read this book but now I feel I have at least some clarity though in reality Im probably as confused as ever I also loved the discussion on black holes white holes and Hawkings black hole radiation The chapter on quantum mechanics the collapse of the quantum wave function and the wave function of the universe is this stuff for real and Miss Kitty is also superb However the book isnt really meant to be an introduction to the fundamentals of physics and cosmology It is about the arrow of time ie why we experience time as flowing from past to present to future and the authors view that it connects not only to the origin of our universe but to a much broader cosmology Were talking multiverses baby universes and all sorts of other wild visions here Carroll believes that they key to understanding time the universe and everything isentropy I would try to summarize entropy here but quite honestly Im now terrified at the thought Carroll spends about  of the book explaining and reexplaining it It all started with some engineers in the th century who were determined to build more effective steam engines But in this book entropys reach extends far far FAR beyond that And whether you are convinced by Carrolls application of entropythermodynamics will determine your final views on this bookIn the end I wasnt totally convinced Entropy is a slippery fuzzy statistical concept and it seemed to me that Carroll had no trouble defining and redefining it on a whim to suit his argument At times this practice has completely ridiculous and nonsensical consequences Boltzmann brains for instance which the author seems to believe are out there And I felt that Carroll spent way too much time chasing down dead ends seemingly for its own sake I did however find the end gameonce we finally got thereto be really intriguing and imaginative It will be interesting to see if his modelof our universe being one of many baby universes that bubbled up from an infinite static highentropy background universeis ever backed up by real data What is it they like to say in physics Shut up and calculate    This is a very good book about some fundamental modern physics concepts such as arrow of time entropy symmetry timereversibility complexity theory of information and their complex interrelationships I found that this book has one of the best explanations of entropy for the layman and the treatment of potentially complex areas such as symmetry quantum mechanics and relativity is very good  deeper than in most popular science books Overall a very enjoyable read which would appeal to a wide audience from the mathematically challenged as maths is very minimal to individuals looking for a deeper treatment of modern physics than what found in most popular science booksJust a couple of areas where I found areas for improvement  in the treatment of quantum mechanics the collapse of the wave function is correctly regarded by the author as a potential problem of the socalled Copenhagen interpretation this is correct but there are other interpretations in particular the DeBroglieBohm theory that overcome this problem yes they are nonlocal but the author himself actually tends to agree with the nonlocality position of this and similar approaches  so a even brief mention of these alternatives would have made the book much more complete  whilst the concept of symmetry is very nicely illustrated and explained unfortunately the very important concept of symmetrybreaking is not explained  which I think is baffling in a book which is supposed to deal with time reversibility and the arrow of time Apart from these minor points a very enjoyable and rewarding read    "},

meaning of life in a dream at  then promptly forgot it because I thought I smelled pancakes I knew this to be trueand yet I have always felt a need to search for the truth that nebulous illtreated creature Adams has always been to me to be a welcome companion in that journey Between the search for meaning and the recognition that its all a joke in poor taste lies Douglas Adams and luckily for us he doesnt seem to mind if you lie there with him Hes a tall guy but hell make roomFor all his crazed unpredictability Adams is a powerful rationalist His humor comes from his attempts to really think through all the things we take for granted It turns out it takes little more than a moments questioning to burst our preconceptions at the seams yet rarely does this stop us from treating the most ludicrous things as if they were perfectly reasonableIt is no surprise that famed atheist Richard Dawkins found a friend and ally in Adams What is surprising is that people often fail to see the rather consistent and reasonable philosophy laid out by Adams quips and absurdities His approach is much more personable and less embittered than Dawkins which is why I think of Adams as a better face for rational materialism which is a polite was of saying atheismReading his books its not hard to see that Dawkins is tired of arguing with uninformed idiots who cant even recognize when a point has actually been made Adams humanism however stretched much further than the contention between those who believe and those who dontWe see it from his protagonists who are not elitist intellectualstheyre not even especially brightbut damn it theyre trying By showing a universe that makes no sense and having his characters constantly question it Adams is subtly hinting that this is the natural human state and the fact that we laugh and sympathize shows that it must be trueIts all a joke its all ridiculous The absurdists might find this depressing but theyre just a bunch of narcissists anyhow Demanding the world make sense and give you purpose is rather self centered when it already contains toasted paninis attractive people in bathing suits and Eulers Identity I say lets sit down at the bar with the rabbi the priest and the frog and try to get a song going Or at least recognize that its okay to laugh at ourselves now and again Its not the end of the worldIts just is a joke but some of us are in on it   In my experience readers either love Adams books or quickly put them down I for example quite literally worship the words Adams puts on the page and have read the Hitchhikers Trilogy so many times that I have large tracts of it memorized But both my wife and father couldnt get past book one the former because she found it too silly and the latter because he found the writing to be more about the authors personality than plot and character WhateverThe first three books in the Hitchhikers TrilogyThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy The Restaurant at the End of the Universe and Life the Universe and Everythingare inspired lunacy The ideas plots puns jokes and phrases that fill their pages have influenced an entire generation of not only writers but people from

universe and everything is  For more of these consult wikipediaorgs entry on The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Cultural References Chances are if youre reading these books for the first time youll be surprised to see how many everyday things were named after Adams creationsThe books arent of course without their problems Adams himself admitted that the Trilogy had and I paraphrase a long beginning a long conclusion and not much in the middle though I cant remember where I read that He was also regularly accused of writing for the sake of cranking out oneliners The books as a whole jump about like a manic puppy on methamphetamines and there are at least a few jokes in there that will completely fly over the heads of any readers who lack a basic comprehension of quantum physics Despite this the Hitchhikers Trilogy remains as the single most entertaining and enjoyable series of books Ive ever reada position theyve occupied for some fifteen years Adams wit and wisdom still baffle me in their greatness and he remains to this day one of only two authors who can regularly consistently make me howl with laughter the other being Terry Pratchett Readers beware if the Adams

impromptu giftgiving than I feel I have accomplished something I only did this because I had a collection of funny pics and couldnt figure out what else to do with them so I bootstrapped them in to a review I care stars   Please before anything DONT PANICThis review is I think that one of the things that one has to keep in mind while reading this book is that it was written in  Having this important factor in perspective its quite astonishing the vision of Douglas Adams the author presenting a lot of visionary elements starting with the very book inside the book I mean The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy since its presented as an electronic book which now its a very common way to read a lot of books now Also he mentioned stuff like touchsensitive screens that yet again its now something introduced in our daily lives ScienceFiction the good science fiction is defined by being visionary in the moment to be published and a fact years later Just like Vernes work predicting events like space rockets and nuclear submarines  Obviously beside the mesmering tecnology stuff that he predicted the signature style here is his remarkable sense of humor SMART sense of humor In literature and pop culture in general there were been unforgettable examples of computers like the cold HAL from  A Space Odyssey and the noble KITT from Knight Rider also robots like the loyal RD from Star Wars and the logical robots from I Robot short story collection However nothing of that can prepare you to the experience of meeting Eddie the Main Computer of the Heart of Gold spaceship or Marvin the Paranoid Android This is one of the best traits of Douglas Adams wit in the development of artificial intelligence I wasnt surprised since some months ago I read Shada by Gareth Roberts but based on the Doctor Whos unaired script written by Douglas Adams where you find another priceless example of a computer with a personality that only Adams is able to develop You laugh and laugh with them BUT not only because theys funny but also they are truly logical as artifical intelligences in their way to react to situations Adams impact of how presenting artificial intelligence can be found too in another novel of Doctor Who Festival of Death by Jonathan Morris where the author showed how well he learned Adams lessons  I believe that Douglas Adams involvement in the production of the iconic British scifi TV series Doctor Who as script editor and writer of three stories it was fated since I found remarkable similarities on the premises of both works this novel and the TV series Both has a peculiar fellow who stole certain machine and along with companions is travelling around So it wouldnt a surprise that he got some inspiration since Doctor Who was widely known since  specially on its native country England Of course his participation on another British TV institution like Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a relevant point for Adams to explode his humoristic potential  Its possible that people unfamiliar with Adams work could think that since this is a novel with comedy they could think that it cant be a serious sciencefiction book However the brilliance of this novel is its capacity of offering smart humor while using scientific concepts like the theory of fasterthanlight objects Even you wont be able to fight against his priceless explanation behind the UFOs sightingsWithout spoiling anything I think that my only reason of getting off a star in my rating of this great novel was its lacking a proper closure I understand that this the first book in a trilogy of five books yes you read correctly it wasnt a mistake so the adventures and mysteries will continue in the second book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe However it was quite unsettling when you are having the time of your life reading it and the book just stopped to have words I describe it like that since I didnt feel an ending It was indeed just like the impossibility of not finding more words in the book What I can give to Adams is that that was quite improbable but in my opinion quite unlikely way to just ending this book Certainly I want to read the rest of this great    of    books Yes yet again you read well and it isnt a mistake   This is not the best book ever written It is unlikely to affect you on any deep emotional level and you probably wont spend sleepless nights just thinking about itBut its a simple humourous scifi adventure It wont do something for everybody but Im a massive fan of Douglas Adams and his sense of humour Come on like it or not Adams has some awesomely quotable sayings not all of these are from this exact book   "},

"text": "Kerouacs classic novel of freedom and longing defined what it meant to be Beat and has inspired every generation since its initial publication This is probably the worst book I have ever finished and Im forever indebted to the deeply personalitydisordered college professor who assigned it because if it hadnt been for that class I never wouldve gotten through and I gotta tell you this is the book I love to hateI deeply cherish but dont know that I fully agree with Truman Capotes assessment that On the Road is not writing at all  its typingLovely Turman but lets be clear typing by itself is fairly innocuous  this book is so awful its actually offensive and even incredibly damagingId be lying if I said there arent parts of this book thatre so bad theyre good  good as in morbidly fascinating in the manner of advancedstage syphilis slides from seventhgrade health class Keroacs ode to the sadeyed Negro is actually an incredible incredible example of something Im glad has been typed For the record So we can all see it clearly and KNOWPlease dont get me wrong My disproportionately massive loathing for Jack Kerouac has zero to do with his unenlightened racial views I mean it was written in the fifties and anyway its great that he was able to articulate these ideas so honestly No the real reason I hate this book so much is that it established a deeply retarded model of EuropeanAmerican male coolness that continues to plague our culture todayI could go into a lot more depth on this topic but its come to my attention that Ive been using my horrible addiction to Bookster to avoid the many obligations and responsiblities of my daily life to which I should now return So in closing this book SUCKS This book is UNBELIEVABLY TERRIBLE And for that very reason especially considering its serious and detrimental impact on western civilization I definitely recommend that you read it if you have not suffered that grave misfortune already   Im supposed to like On the Road right Well I dont I hate it and I always have There are a lot of reasons why I hate it I find Kerouacs attitude toward the world pathetically limited and paternalistic In    he actually muses about how much he wishes that he could have been born a Negro in the antebellum South living a simple life free from worry and does so seemingly without any sense of irony On every page the book is about how Kerouac a young white middleclass solipsistic alcoholic feels and nothing more But thats only one reason I hate this book The main reason I hate it is because for me reading Kerouacs prose is almost physically painful I love the ramblings of selfcentered drunks when theyre selfdeprecating ironic andor funny but Kerouac was none of these things He was a pretentious selfimportant bore who produced some of the most painfully bad and inconsequential prose of the th century Or any century   A View from the CouchOTR has received some negative reviews lately so I thought I would try to explain my ratingThis novel deserves to lounge around in a five star hotel rather than languish in a lone star saloonDisclaimerPlease forgive my review It is early morning and I have just woken up with a sore head an empty bed and a full bladderConfesssionLet me begin with a confession that dearly wants to become an assertionI probably read this book before most of you were bornSo thereWouldnt you love to say thatIf only I had the courage of my convictionsInstead I have only convictions and they are many and variedHowever I am sure that by the end of my this sentence I shall be releasedElevated to the BarI read OTR in my teens which were spread all over the end of the s and the beginning of the sMy life was dominated by Scouting for BoysI mean the book not the activityMy mantra was be prepared although at the time I didnt realise that this actually meant be prepared for warAfter reading OTR my new mantra was be inebriatedMind you I had no idea what alcohol tasted like but it sounded goodGone were two boys in a tent and three men in a boatOTR was about trying to get four beats in a bar no matter how far youd travelled that dayTyping or WritingForget whether it was just typing rather than writingThat was just Truman Capote trying to dot one of Dorothy Parkers eyesThis is like focusing on the mince instead of the sausageAll Drums and SymbolsYou have to appreciate what OTR symbolised for people like meIt was On the Road not In the House or In the BurbsIt was about dynamism not passivityIt wasnt about a stream of consciousness it was about a river of activityIt was about white light white heat not white picket fencesSavouring the SausageOK your impressions are probably more recent than mineMine are memories that have been influenced by years of indulgence I do maintain that alcohol kills the unhealthy brain cells first so it is actually purifying your brainI simply ask that you overlook the mince and savour the sausageBeyond EphemeralityI would like to make one last parting metaphorI have misappropriated it from the musician Dave GraneyHe talks about feeling ephemeral but looking eternalDave comes from the Church of the Latter Day HipstersHe is way cooler than me he even looks great in leather pants in a spivvy kinda wayHowever I think the point he was making if not then the point I am making is that most of life is ephemeral It just happens and its gone foreverHowever in Daves case the way he looks the way he feels he turns it into something eternalIts his art his music our pleasure our memories at least until we dieFootnotes on CoolCreativity and style are our last chance attempt to defy ephemerality and mortality and become eternalYes all that stuff between the bookends of OTR might be typing it might be preserving ephemerality that wasnt worthy or deservingHowever the point is the attempt to be your own personal version of coolHeck no way am I cool like the Beats or James Dean or Marlon Brando or Jack Nicholson or Clint Eastwood or Keith Richards or Camille PagliaHowever I am trying to live life beyond the ephemeralThats what OTR means to me If it doesnt mean that to you hey thats alright Im OK youre OK Its coolOriginal posted March     Ive been thinking about this book a lot lately so I figured that Id go back and write something about it When I first read this book I loved it as a piece of art but its effect on me was different than I expected So many people hail Kerouac as the artist who made them quit their jobs and go to the road become a hippie or a beat and give up the rest When I read it though I had been completely obsessed with hippie culture for a long time and it caused me to steer away from it for a while While I thought that it would be a rollicking tale of freedom and glory I found that all of Deans conquests were tainted by the fact that he had to take advantage of other people every step of the way He was a hugely entertaining character but would have been a terrible friend lover or even acquaintance From the women he married to gas station attendents right down to Sal Paradise himself Dean drained everything that he was right out of other people and it eventually ruined him It left him beatnot heart beating exhilarated but beat up dead beat and alone Once I stepped back a little from the awe at Deans greatness this book was really sad and it caused me to put away that romanticism for a whileNow  years later though On the Road is coming back to me full on I didnt escape the total wonder at the Beats and the road I have been on the road myself for the last  months and have a long way to go before I get back home and I am constantly aware that the the way was paved by Kerouac and the rest of the crazy geniuses of his generation The road is every bit as romantic as Sal Paradise made it out to be and its glory far out weighs the short comings of Dean as a friend I mean the road is a lot like Dean it takes a lot out of you but you get addicted to it and obsessed with it and cant let it go and I dont think theres any other way about it I am in love with America for the first time Now that Ive seen it driven across and up and down around and over America I find it sublime and incredible I think that Kerouac and his friends mightve been the first to see that Maybe not Maybe they are just part of all of American historythey translated the world of Western expansion and canvas covered wagons into the way of the modern world America is something to dream about It is worthy every exuberant and formerly offensive Im proud sticker thats plastered on the back of a pick up truck And Kerouac saw that first hand So it seems that there is a certain tragedy in this book but that it is less important than the unavoidable glory that you come to associate with the road and freedom after following these guys on their crazy adventure I think this book should be read by everyone who wants to know about America   This is the book which has given me anxiety attacks on sleepless nightsThis is the book which has glared at me from its high pedestal of classical importance in an effort to browbeat me into finally finishing it And this is that book which has shamed me into feigning an air of ignorance every time I browsed any of the countless bookstoreadbeforeyoudie listsYes Jack Kerouac you have tormented me for the past  years and every day I couldnt summon the strength to open another page of On the Road and subject my brain to the alltoofamiliar torture of Sals sleepinducing infuriatingly monotonous narration Finally I conquer you after nearly  years of dithering I am the victorious one in the battle in which you have relentlessly assaulted my finer senses with your crassness and innate insipidity and dared me to plod on I can finally beat my chest in triumph ugh pardon the Tarzanish metaphor but a star review deserves no better and announce to the world that I have finished reading On the Road Oh what an achievement And what a monumental waste of my timeDear Beat Generation classic I can finally state without any fear of being called out on my ignorance that I absolutely hated reading you Every moment of it Alternatively this book can be named White Heterosexual Mans Misadventures and Chauvinistic Musings And even that makes it sound much more interesting and less offensive than it actually is In terms of geographical sweep the narrative covers nearly the whole of America in the s weaving its way in and out of Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco and many other major American cities Through the eyes of Salvatore Sal Paradise a professional bum we are given an extended peek into the lives of a band of merry havenots their hapless trysts with women booze drugs homelessness destitution jazz as they hitchhike and motor their way through the heart of America Sounds fascinating right Ayn Rand will vehemently disagree though But no its anything but that Instead this one just shoves Jack Kerouacs internalized white superiority sexism and homophobia right in the readers face in the form of some truly bad writing This book might as well come with a caption warning any potential reader who isnt White or male or straight I understand that this was written way before it became politically incorrect to portray women in such a poor light or wistfully contemplate living a Negros life in the antebellum South But theres an obvious limit to the amount of his vile ruminations I can tolerate  Seriously Godblessed patience Every female character in this one is a vague silhouette or a caricature of a proper human being Marylou Camille Terry Galatea are all frighteningly onedimensional  they never come alive for the reader through Sals myopic vision They are merely there as inanimate props reduced to the status of languishing in the background and occasionally allowed to be in the limelight when the men begin referring to them as if they were objectsEither they are whores for being as sexually liberated as the men are or they are screaming wives who throw their husbands out of the house for being jobless cheating drunks or they are opportunistic and evil simply because they do not find Sal or Dean or Remy or Ed or any of the men in their lives to be deserving of their trust and respect which they truly arentAnd sometimes they are only worthy of only a one or twoline description like the following  Look at Sal talking about a woman as if she were a breed of cat he wanted to rescue from the animal shelter    Is Marylou a wrench or a machine of some kind And this is not to mention the countless instances of get you a girl get girls Lets get a girl and other minor variations of the same strewn throughout the length of the book and some of Sals thoughts about queers which are equally revolting Maybe I am too much of a nonAmerican with no ties to a real person who sees the Beat era through the lenses of pure nostalgia or maybe I am simply incapable of appreciating the themes of youthful wanderlust and living life with a perverse aimlessness or maybe its the flat writing and appalling representation of women Whatever the real reasons maybe I can state with conviction that this is the only American classic which I tried to the best of my abilities to appreciate but failed   "},

"author": "Jay Griffiths",
"text": "In Wild Jay Griffiths describes an extraordinary odyssey through wildernesses of earth ice water and fire A poetic consideration of the tender connection between human society and the wild the book is by turns passionate political funny and harrowing It is also a journey into that greatest of uncharted landsthe wilderness of the mindand Griffiths beautifully explores the language and symbolism that shape our experience of our own wildness  Part travelogue part manifesto for wildness as an essential character of life Wild is a oneofakind book from a oneofakind author It took me long to actually realise what this book was about it is actually a travel book full of wandering on language history environmental issues etc often with a focus on nonurbanized wild people such as Amazonian tribes and Eskimo huntersThe best thing about it is the language Jay Griffiths can write as well as any writer Ive ever come across Just see how she describes the life in the coral reefs its poetry in prose a symphony in wordsAs for the actual content she makes a strong case for the need of our society to revalue the importance of wildness and challenges the wide held notion of the cultural and moral superiority of western modern society over traditional cultures eg aboriginal hunter gatherers Though she doesnt lack neither facts nor linguistic prowess to make her case and while personally sharing both her environmental concerns and her adversion to Christian religion she partly ruins it by portraying wild people as the good guys and civilised invaders as the bad usually in a judgemental way with no room for nuance or doubt I think this is not so much an antidote to the utterly negative view long held and still held by western society towards other cultures but rather an overraction to it that will please only those readers who already share her point of viewAt times her reasoning is quite poor For instance while rightly denouncing the derogatory meaning of some terms in the English language commonly applied to wild nondomesticated plant and animal species such as weed or pest she then tries to support her view of the Inuit as an environmentally wiser people since their language has no word for either pest or vermin or weed  a fact that indicates little or nothing being merely a reflection of the Inuit being hunter gatherers and most importantly of being almost no flora at all where they live When she denounces the intolerance of the missionary in West Papua and their complicity with the Indonesia military that every year kill innocent people she then asserts that before this the natives only killed for reasonable reasons such as rituals  should we conclude that killing for one religion is wrong but killing for another is not Or again when she seeks to demonstrate the innate kindness of nature and precivilization humans through an etymological analysis of the word kind  didnt realize that the etymology of a word can alone be evidence of how our ancestors behavedI insist on the drawbacks rather than the virtues of this book because I believe it really had the potential of being a masterpiece if only the author had not been so wildly blackandwhite Perhaps this raw at times unreasonable passion is part of what makes this book so fascinating but upon reflection I must consider it its greatest limit The lack of a coherent narrative structure makes it easy to read at small bites like on a short bus ride but on the other hand may give you the headache if you try to follow it for more than  minutesThis book could have been something truly special It isntwsa   Ive never read a book quite like this its very difficult to describe Seven years in the writing like some mythical heros trials its a hymn to the wild written by a young poet anthropologist philosopher adventurer and probably manic depressive too Its divided into sections for each element Earth Ice an element on its own Water Fire and Air and Griffiths travels the globe in search of unspoiled wildness the Amazon the Arctic Indonesia Australia and West Papua with a brief epilogue in Outer Mongolia It might seem overdone in places but there is some wonderful sweeping poetry and passionate advocacy of the rights of savages as well as epic rage against suburbia Christianity and golf courses among other thingsThe language itself is wild and anarchic although she is wonderful on the etymology of words drawing all sorts of intriguing connections On the enclosure of land in Australia for example Fence means not only boundary but also the keeper of stolen goods and settlers stealing the land fenced it before they did anything elseHer bibliography is staggeringly eclectic and erudite she quotes the Bible Rousseau Francis Bacon Conrad and Flanders and Swann with equal facility Yet despite her erudition she can become fully absorbed by wild cultures getting stoned with shamans in Peru going out with whale hunters in Alaska or struggling through mountains and swamps in West Papua with local guides whom she feels more at home with than the obnoxioussounding anthropologist who is her companionI took seven years over this work spent all I had my time money and energy Part of the journey was a green riot and part a deathly bleakness I got ill I got well  I got to the point of collapse I got the giggles I met cannibals infinitely kinder and more trustworthy than the murderous missionaries who evangelize them  I found a paradox of wildness in the glinting softness of its charisma for what is savage is in the deepest sense gentle and what is wild is kind   Ive just recently finished reading this book  after eight months I really laboured through it and only finished it because I dont like starting a book and not finishing it It came highly recommended by someone I admire but I have a few quibbles with itJay writes exquisitely which I truly admire and envy her for She is also extremely brave and adventurous for having tackled places and situations that she writes about I also share many of her views on wildness What irked me was her selfrighteous tone at times I did find her preachy and often inconsistent and offensive in her viewsShe does unilaterally dismiss all western white people as being in the wrong and all primitiveie victims of the white westerners and untainted by civilizationpeople and their cultures as right Of course there was a lot of wrong done in the name of civilization and turning people to Christianity but there must have been a lot of good people among them too Likewise I dont believe for a moment that the primitive people are not capable of their own atrocities tooShe comes across as prowomen but she does admit that she feels more comfortable in the presence of men and her description of the people in West Papua does point to chauvinist behaviour When a child dies in that society it is womensears or finger tips that are chopped off and not mens She writes eloquently of being allowed as an honorary man to sit with the men in their hut at night while they smoked but Id like to ask why the women in that society are excluded from such gatherings Isnt it reminiscent of men only clubs in the western world or of Victorian times when women used to beat a hasty retreat after dinner to leave the men to their port and cigarsAnother point is her bashing of Christianity Each to their own and all that but would she have got away if she wrote like this about the Jewish faith or Islam A little respect for other belief systems whether you agree with them or not would not have detracted from the value of the bookAt the end she describes her heartbreak very movingly but then goes on to say that after a period  a few weeks  its time to thrive and start living again as nature does Well good for her but for some people it takes longer than others to recover from tragic events and some dont recover at all Are such people less than othersA great author but a little humility would not hurt    While I enjoyed the stories of her global travels and descriptions of other cultures and customs I was intensely repelled by Ms Griffiths obvious deepseated hatred for so many things especially white people and western civilization Ms Griffiths has a way with words and can weave beautiful poetic images yet often resorts to crude slang If you enjoy odd philosophical meanderings and radical ideologies pseudointellectual ecosocialism and scathing attacks on the moralism and ethics of anyone who isnt a loinclothgird savage this book is for you   If you only have time for one sentence hear this Jay Griffiths book Wild is one of the most powerful books Ive ever read Wild is a celebration of wildness and freedom It celebrates societies that work societies that have complete respect for their ecosystems societies that have survived for thousands of years without suffering destructive whirlwinds of mass hysteriaGriffiths is a brilliant heretic and a proud one Her book shows us what happens when madness collides with wildness It helps us understand the dark injuries that destroyed our own freedom and put us on the path to what we have become It is  pages of fullthrottle outsidethebox thinking written with passion and eloquence For outsidethebox thinkers its just awesome For light sleepers it might provide a lifechanging wakeup call Griffiths was born in deepest darkest England a devastated island that was once a magnificent rainforest She was blessed with the precious curse and gift of having an active mind She excelled at asking penetrating questions that were not proper for young ladies or lads to ask The wardens were not amusedDuring her teen years she hung out with fundamentalist Christians but what they were teaching could not survive rational scrutiny and her mind was highly allergic to blind faith Painful clashes inspired her to run away She abandoned the normal life for which she had been trained I lost a walled city but found a wildness and freedom I never regretted itShe wandered around the world but life was not always easy Following a passionate freedom can mean loneliness penury humiliation for we live in a world where the caged hate the free By and by she floated away into a healthy dance with depression Depression is one of lifes valuable idiot lights warning us that its time to pay attention and alter our courseOne day the phone rang and a friend invited her to Peru where she could hang out with shamans use powerful medicine and recover her lost soul So she did and it worked The heavy black clouds soon dispersed She spent the next seven years working on her book travelling from the Amazon to New Guinea Australia and Arctic CanadaWe routinely teach our children that wild people are primitive and that their way of life is inferior and undesirable In so doing we erect a brick wall that prohibits fresh wild notions from flushing the crud out of our wheezing slobbering imaginations Instead we teach our children to live like theres no tomorrow to shop till you drop to leave nothing behind for future generationsGriffiths understands that the brick wall must be smashed for the sake of all life Her mind is a sledgehammer She takes us on visits to wild ecosystems that stood in the path of the alldevouring global economy She listened to the wild people in a caring and respectful manner hearing their pain rage and despair They had a healthy way of life before the invasion They needed nothing from us They simply wanted to be left alone She took long treks through the jungle with wild people who possessed immense knowledge of the plants and animals They perceived that all flora and fauna have spirits except for domesticated plants They saw that all wild beings were animated by the same life force but different species appeared in different forms We were all equal When humans lived like equals rather than masters they didnt gang rape their ecosystem because that would have been inconceivable After days of hiking through a perfectly healthy land a treasure of abundant life they stumbled upon the town of Maldonado the cash economy the modern world  electric lights pop music abundant booze and drugs discarded syringes splatters of puke and overflowing outhouses Everyone seemed to be mad To me the forest had been wildly beautiful and the town was a hideous wastelandOne chapter was devoted to the vast wildness of the sea the place where all life began The surface of Mars is better known to us than the floor of our oceans The underwater world is a realm of immense beauty and diversity Cetaceans like whales and dolphins are incredibly intelligent and they live in an incredibly intelligent manner exactly as evolution prepared them to live wild and free without technology a brilliant strategy for longterm successThe ocean is a place where primates have little business beyond the shoreline Civilized primates have become abusive ravaging the sea life and filling the waters with toxins sewage garbage and noise Climate change is making the oceans so acidic that catastrophic harm now seems very likely Wild people didnt do this  even when they lived too hard the harm they caused was far far less than the harm caused by our way of lifeMissionaries were high on the list of people that Griffiths most resented because their mission was to destroy wild cultures and convert wild people into literate employed Christian consumers In Peru four different missionary groups using helicopters and speed boats competed to find uncontacted tribes They knew that they would import deadly diseases but they didnt care In some places half of the people died within two years of their arrival The priests blamed female shamans for the illness and the angry people killed the shamansCommon gifts for the converts included axes tobacco clothing and mirrors Mirrors enabled people to see their own faces and become more aware of their individuality Jesus saved individuals not communities God lived in heaven and the Earth was a realm of wickedness so it didnt matter it was worthless Missionaries built roads into the jungle which were soon used by miners loggers and other destroyers Separated from the family of life the modern heart gets hardMissionaries forced the natives to surrender their sacred objects which they burned Within two generations traditional knowledge becomes extinct because it is no longer being passed down to the young who spend their days in classrooms Cultural genocide is emotionally shattering In one Brazilian tribe over  natives committed suicideIn Australia the invasion of civilization has been devastating for the Aborigines and their home but the elders maintain a sense of patience for the noxious cities are nothing more than ugly scabs Whites have never possessed the spirit of the land which remains alive beneath the parking lots and shopping centers With time the disease will pass the land will heal and thrive once again to the best of its abilityHumans are not domesticated we are genetically wild animals but so many have been tamed Tamed creatures are doltminded and dumb insipid and bland Griffiths tells us The tame are trained only to hear the voice of their tamer having ears only for command Our wild genes scream in despair as we go berserk with cage rage Sensible habits and good road safety skills will keep you alive till eighty So what If you didnt know freedom you never livedThe myth of human superiority has constructed an enormous ecocidal monstrosity and its ongoing selfdestruction will result in unimaginable harm If we cannot find a way to return to our humble place in the family of life we will have no future Thats the message here   "},
{"title": "Into The Wild",
"isbn": "033045367X",
"author": "Jon Krakauer",
"text": "What would possess a gifted young man recently graduated from college to literally walk away from his life Noted outdoor writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer tackles that question in his reporting on Chris McCandless whose emaciated body was found in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness in  Described by friends and relatives as smart literate compassionate and funny did McCandless simply read too much Thoreau and Jack London and lose sight of the dangers of heading into the wilderness alone Krakauer whose own adventures have taken him to the perilous heights of Everest provides some answers by exploring the pull the outdoors seductive yet often dangerous has had on his own life This book is a wonderful cautionary tale I will probably read it again with my daughter when she is old enough to discuss it Unfortunately Im afraid the reason most people will read the book and see the new upcoming movie is for a different reason Chris McCandless in the book and from what I understand in the movie is a hero and courageous for flying in the face of everything he grew up with to find a better way A young man unhappy with the materialism hunger and waste in the world angry with his father for not being a perfect father to him intellectually superior a fantastic athlete in top condition and yet a young man who died because of his own decisions and his own actions He cut off ties to his family hitchhiked and worked his way to Alaska headed into the wild in April  and was found dead in August  most probably from starvation How wonderful to fight against the odds and ask real questions Unfortunately Chris didnt really fight against any odds he took the easy way out by cutting off real relationships Chris may have asked real questions but he denied real people the opportunity to answer them in any way because he had already decided what was the right way This is not heroic It is immaturity It is tragic and sad yes but not heroic or courageousAfter reading the book I think Chris died because he was foolish Intellectually bright yes Athletically gifted yes But he had no wisdom Wisdom has been defined as skill in living and wisdom is not always bestowed on the young and the healthy and the intellectually smart The opposite of wisdom is foolishness His anger and questioning drove him not to wisdom but to selfreliance and an overweening arrogance in his own ability to get through it Well we see the result of those decisions and those attitudes to quote Darwin Chris is an example of how survival of the fittest applies Chris was not fit therefore he did not survive But why wasnt he fit He was smart and young and gifted in many ways but he chose to abandon relationships and abandon those who loved him and create himself anew with no relationships and no ties He walked away from people who loved him made friends with people who came to love him and walked away from all of that to find his answers in the wild on his own The way away from love and relationship leads not to life but indeed to death And death is what Chris gotThe book quotes Chris mother as saying I havent prayed since we lost him pg  An older man who befriended Chris Ronald Franz also says When Alex left for Alaska I prayed I asked God to keep his finger on the shoulder of that one I told him that boy was special But he let Alex die So on December  when I learned what had happened I renounced the Lord I withdrew my church membership and became an atheist I decided I couldnt believe in a God who would let something that terrible happen to a boy like Alex pg  But God didnt do anything to Chris except let him do as he wanted If Chris sought real answers to his hard questions God is there and God can help but you have to know you need help and submit to someone wiser than you Chris McCandless never submitted willingly to anyone and he certainly never admitted anyone else had teaching or wisdom for him He was smarter than everyone else better able to see the truth than anyone else So the heritage Chris McCandless left is one that drives his mother to stop praying and converts an old man to atheism Is this the heritage anyone would wantSo read this book but read it with questions in mind Why are we lauding a young man as a hero who was actually a foolish man What kind of society are we in where real courage and real heroism are somehow playing nd fiddle to selfishness and arrogance When are you so intellectually intelligent that you become stupid Is there any time when foolish decisions could be called courageous In a search for truth and what really matters in life is it acceptable to think nothing of hurting those people who are most vulnerable to you When you die will the way you lived your life cause others to abandon their faith or grow in their faith Is it ever courageous to be selfish and think only of yourself Is it harder to walk away from a relationship or to stay in a relationship and work on making it better Would you ever teach anyone else that the way to have real relationships is to limit yourself only to those people who cannot ever hurt youReal courage real heroism comes when you love others and you serve others Real courage has nothing selfish in it Fathers and husbands who remain with their families and provide for them even though they would rather have a midlife crisis and leave it all they are courageous and heroic They remain they work they dont father or husband perfectly but they remain in difficult relationships It courageous to stay in the hard parts of life and try Mothers and wives who sacrifice and serve again and again and again without books being written about them without thanks but who continue to love and give of themselves to others That is courageous It is hard to stay in messy relationships It is easy to leave It is courageous to stay and do hard things It is easy to leave and do what you wantSo lets read this book but read it as a cautionary tale This is what happens when you seemingly have it all but have not love When you die will people be driven to become atheists Will people stop praying when you are dead Or will you live a life of wisdom and love Will you leave behind you a heritage of godly love and service Will people pray more because of the example you left them Will they be more loving better mothers or fathers or sisters or brothers Or will they become angry and arrogant and foolishness Yes this is a good book to read But lets read it for the right reasons and with the right questionsNOTE In the book and in the movie the author proposes that Chris ate some poison berries which caused his death But tests have been made around the area and plants that would have been available to Chris were tested and no toxic berries or plants have been found The truth is probably that he starved Too few calories coming in high expenditure of calories for hunting and keeping warm resulted eventually in such a calorie deficit that he died Some good articles I found on Chris McCandless includehttpwwwnewsminercomnewsaphttpnmgegmuedutextandcommunityAlaskan Park Ranger Peter Christian wrote I am exposed continually to what I will call the McCandless Phenomenon People nearly always young men come to Alaska to challenge themselves against an unforgiving wilderness landscape where convenience of access and possibility of rescue are practically nonexistent  When you consider McCandless from my perspective you quickly see that what he did wasnt even particularly daring just stupid tragic and inconsiderate First off he spent very little time learning how to actually live in the wild He arrived at the Stampede Trail without even a map of the area If he had had a good map he could have walked out of his predicament  Essentially Chris McCandless committed suicide Some may argue that this is what he wanted all along given his troubled pastAn update as of Sept  as to how McCandless died See httpwwwnewyorkercomonlineblogs which documents the poison contained in wild potato seeds Consuming these seeds introduces a neurotoxin into the body which results in lathyrism This condition causes gradual paralysis which ultimately made McCandless very weak unable to stand or walk and thus unable to forage or hunt for food   My grandfathernot an Alaskan but an experienced outdoorsmanwould have tied this kid to a tree and let the bears play tetherball with himA small part of me appreciates the effort Krakauer put into researching this book A much bigger part of me is completely disgusted both with McCandless himself and with Krakauers mindless adoration of him Krakauer pulls out all the stops to make McCandless look like a phenomenon and seems to agree with McCandless that the world should have handed itself to him on a silver salver because he was just so darned special Were told he was brilliant independent funny kind musical athletic visionary talented Can you see the halo Unfortunately the impression that comes across is of a snotty adolescent who has never seriously thought of anyone but himself and is used to getting by on charm and flippancy rather than making good use of his considerable gifts and I do not doubt that he was gifted The conflicting aspects of his personality dont sound quirky they sound devious and selfservingKrakauer tries halfheartedly to disguise his fascination but his admissions that McCandless was a clueless young hothead sound insincere he has to say it to sound credible to his readers who are less smitten Krakauer makes an apt comparison between himself as an idealistic and foolhardy young man and McCandless and then dismisses himself because he didnt have McCandless intellect This sounds utterly bogus after all we have been told about McCandless foolish mistakes and the obvious fact that Krakauer is not stupid Two chapters that could have provided some insight into his hero are wasted because Krakauer sounds like a religious fanatic with McCandless as his unknowable God and Krakauer as the Imnotworthy followerMcCandless and Everett Ruess overconfidence speaks to a fascination with nature but not a respect for it Courage is not the same as not knowing when we ought to have a healthy degree of fear Instead McCandless arrogantly drives his car into the habitat of an endangered species of poppy He butchers a moose wasting the life of a beautiful and welladapted animal because he could not be bothered to learn ahead of time how to preserve itThis was not a tragedy this was inevitable I dont believe he was schizophrenic or suicidal Bipolar or ADD maybe His own friends readily admitted that he had a lot of enthusiasm but little common sense and didnt know much outside of academia There are so many glaring outdoorsmanship errors made in the first two chapter that even I was cringingI write this with full admission that I am not much of an outdoorsperson However I dont believe for a minute that he lasted longer than most of us would have or that at least he tried it as so many of his fans insist I wouldnt try it not because Im scared but because I can tell from here that ten pounds of rice and no preparation is a recipe for failure I dont need to try it and if I did Id want to live to get something out of it Lots of other people have gone into the wilderness and come out just fine because they knew the magnitude of their own insignificance and planned aheadIm not jealous of his alleged brilliance either I was accepted to Emory And the University of Chicago And a couple of other amply respected schools Lots of people are Big deal His bourgeois status made his adventure possible in the first place He had money to pay his college tuition the rest of us graduated and went to work to pay off our loans He also had the gall to complain about his parents offers to help him out which smacks of a kid given so much that he doesnt know how fortunate he isFurthermore living with nothing by choice is very different from living with nothing because you have no alternative Though Im sure he would have denied it McCandless had the option of going back to his affluent life if he had wanted to or if he had had to in an emergency Maybe it would have knocked his selfimage for a loop but he would have been sheltered fed and nursed back to health A lot of people live in poverty without that safety net  Now is not the time to be squeamish about killing animals Hint There are no vegetarian Aleut This guy was a history and anthropology major I learned in anthro that you can eat plants and lean protein until you burst and still starve to death if you arent getting enough calories Its very difficult to feed yourself if youre alone and dont have a lot of practice at it If he got this idea from Thoreau and London he wasnt reading very carefully McCandless should have read less Thoreau and more Donner Party Londons Alaskan experience was during the Klondike Gold Rush when he had plenty of help from others Thoreau lived in a cabin on the edge of town a mile and a half from the family home He was not in the wilderness Furthermore Thoreaus civil disobedience was a protest against the Mexican War and slavery not a petty defiance of matters of public safety such as mandatory car insurance McCandless was a rebel without a cause Booksmart cant save you now Successonly learning does not work Krakauer goes into raptures about McCandless education and intelligence to demonstrate the supposed tragedy of his loss Nice brain gymnastics but apples to oranges when what you need is practical knowledgeThis guy was idolized by some my college classmates most of whom were sheltered relatively wealthy urbanites They had the same vague and pathetic need for real experiences and arrogant expectation of success that comes from never having failed at anything in their lives For most of his trip McCandless was neither independent or selfreliant He got lost in Mexico it would have been more selfreliant to get a map and take charge of his own navigation He didnt eat for days until somebody felt sorry for him and fed him Once he was in a situation where there was nobody to step in for him he died in this respect I disagree with Krakauer that McCandless was any different from Carl McCunn Even at that point he left a note on the door of the bus begging for rescueThe best and most independent outdoorsmen spend years learning Just because you were a superstar student and athlete doesnt mean you get to skip all the hard work Ive no doubt that McCandless was smart but he was mindbogglingly ignorant and inexperienced Why are these selfdiscovery escapades always so selfcentered How about joining the Peace Corps Teaching in innercity schools Working in healthcare in a remote South Asian village If youre so disgusted with society why dont you do something to improve it rather than keeping all the enlightenment for yourself Nature is not your babysitter Nature doesnt care if you live or die Its survival of the fittest and humans compared to most animals are slow weak poorlyarmed poorlyinsulated have no stamina have poor senses of smell eyesight and hearing and are illadapted to go without clean water and food for any length of time We are clearly meant to live in groups and use tools This guy didnt even bring an ax He was already controlled and tainted by society or else he would not have worked so hard to avoid it His antisociety and antimaterialism were as controlling of him as is the materialism of those who think they can find themselves by buying the right clothes or drug habit or SUV Unprepared people who set out on illplanned adventures and need to be rescued are jackasses A lot of other peoplebetterprepared bettertrained and more sensible people such as park service volunteers and EMTsend up spending a lot of time and money and risking their own necks to save them McCandless spared everyone that trouble but Im sure theres a whole line of wannabes lined up to try it I hope they have to pay back every penny spent on their rescuesAnd Truth The bad news is that Truth is relative It doesnt exist in a vacuum What a waste   Overall I was pretty disappointed with this book The genesis of the book was an indepth magazine article and I suspect that the article was superb But I just dont think theres enough here to warrant an entire book As evidence I point to several lengthy chapters that have nothing to do with the underlying storythey discuss other people who have gone into the wild and surprisingly Krakauer includes a whole chapter about himselfMy other problem is that I found myself unable to identify or empathize with the central character here I think that Chris McCandless was not much more than a privileged entitled selfish and undeniably intelligent person who threw everything away and nearly destroyed his family for reasons that werent any clearer by the end of the book than they were at the beginning I worried far more about his parents and his sister who he called his best friend than I did about himI ended up finishing the book by skimming the last  or maybe even the last  I almost gave this only  star but decided to go with  because I want to give Krakauer the benefit of the doubtits a wellwritten book I just dont think it needed to be written at all   I live a life I suspect that is much like yours Wake up go to work come home eat dinner go to bed At the end of this weekly desert there might be a drink or ten to celebrate the victory over another five days of soulcrushing drudgeryI am a desk jockey A paper pusher I mean that literally I sit in my office and when people peer inside they will see me moving a sheet of paper from one side to the other It looks to the untrained eye like valuable labor When I get the chance though I head to the mountains to the wild I love the awayness of these trips At the risk of sounding absurdly curmudgeonly I like getting away from the crush of humanity and Im sure the crush of humanity appreciates my temporary absence There was at time when my friends and I would head out west every summer We picked a destination isolated challenging packed the car and plunged into the wilderness We undertook silly risks because we were younger and we laughed at consequences or at the possibility that there were consequences Once a little later on we gathered around a campfire four of us and swore  like characters from a young adult novel  that wed always do this that wed always head out to the mountains together Then we got older My friends married they started having kids and the mountains became a memory a slideshow of pictures that showed up on the screen savers of our computers Friends with whom Id jumped off cliffs slid down glaciers and climbed rocks matured overnight into sober professionals husbands and fathers It was remarkable how age engendered caution and squelched the desire for adventure That was my mindset when I picked up Into the Wild Jon Krakauers classic is to put it mildly a polarizing book Based on the people Ive surveyed Ive found that you either love it or you hate it and whether you love it or hate it will be determined by what you think about Christopher McCandless the young man at the center of Into the Wild You will be taken in by Chriss literate philosophical iconoclastic boundarypushing vagabondism Or you will be sickened by his selfishness his selfpity and the way he left a shattered family in his wake Either way you will have a vivid responseUpon graduating from Emory University and instead of going on to law school which was my choice McCandless gave away  to charity and began his life as a tramp or hobo as they sometimes like to be called I was in sixth grade when McCandless walked into the Alaskan wilderness and never returned He was  The power of Into the Wild is directly attributable to Krakauers empathy for his subject Krakauer is a solid adventure writer but hes not a prose stylist Rather he uses his own life experiences to connect with Chris on a very intimate personal level He does not attempt any faux objectivity that is often the hallmark of serious serious journalism Instead Krakauer admits straight up that he saw his younger self in Chris with the exception that Krakauer survived his youth while Chris did not For instance there is an autobiographical section in Into the Wild where Krakauer tells his story about climbing the Devils Thumb This could easily have been a selfserving digression but Krakauer uses that experience and the vividness of his memory to explore the the compulsions that drove Chris McCandless to follow his unique path to his destiny I think Chris in his own way was a towering figure he was the person I would like to be if I had more guts and less excuses He was a smart kid a college grad who came from money His parents were messed up but really whose parents arent After college instead of going to law school dont go to law school by the way he gave away  burned his credit cards and set out to see the west Whatever else you call him you cant call him a poser Like everyone he had his share of dreams and demons and he set out to follow his dreams and fight his demons Theres something to be said for what he put his parent through Still the world forces us to be our own person He went forward the best way he knew how defining himself along the way The tragedy of course is that the lessons he learned  about the value of friends and family  he learned too late I dont really need to defend Chris Krakauer does that He is unabashedly in his corner defending his choices his skills his desire to go alone to the far places like John Muir before him Chris McCandless was himself fully and completely which is saying a lot in this day and age Or any day and age He was part adventurer part philosopher and part monk the monk part fascinates Krakauer who spends a lot of time wondering whether Chris died a virgin I suppose a brief note on the movie directed by Sean Penn is in order While I found it poetic and inspiring the movie focuses too much on Chriss effect on the various people he meets on his journeys In a way Chris becomes some kind of wondering apostle healing and helping those he meets along his path before he dies a martyrs death in Alaska a vision from a Don Maclean song the world was never meant for one as beautiful as you The book on the other hand keeps Chris firmly grounded as a human being Krakauer admires Chris to be sure but he does not neglect the warts However Krakauer sharply dismisses those armchair psychiatrists who want to diagnose Chris with a mental disorder Im glad he does I think its saying soemething about the conformity of our society that anyone who bucks the trend he gave up law school is called mad In the end Chris was one of those rare people who wanted to know the world intimately and in the process of discovering those secrets was killed by that same world Maybe there was something quixotic or foolish in his quest maybe he should have taken a job taken a wife found a safe desk behind which to grow old Or maybe there is something foolish in us to believe that we can outlive the world with our caution    I love Jon Krakauer I didnt find one single thing about the Alex McCandless even remotely interesting He came across as a spoiled brat with no concept of reality  basically because of his priveleged upbringing But somehow he blamed his parents for that void of myopic self absorption I live in Alaska and Ive lived in Idaho and Colorado and Oregon    basically AROUND people who love the great outdoors I am more comfortable in a heated coffee shop READING about the great outdoors Still I know that heading into any forest  particularly one at that latitude and altitude in pursuit of adventure with a no food b no gear c no plan and d no backup plan is nothing short of delusional or maybe just stupidI absolutely adore Jon Krakauers attempts to explain Alexs possible motives and angst I get that Krakauer identifies with some of what gnawed at Alex    that discontent    that feeling that life cant possibly be this pointless    etc I wonder about those things with fairly consistent frequency I suppose I have my own means of stamping those feelings out alternating burst of extreme carbohydrate consumption and running or spinning work and volunteerism Still the fact that Alex died of exposure in an abandoned bus in Denali National Park is less poignant than poetic  justice that is Darwinism if you want to be cruel Cringe That sounded really awful didnt it But Krakauer carefully paints a picture of a young man completely disillusioned with the life that his parents provided for him the future they groomed him for A life easier better than theirs He points to his parents mistakes and flaws as lightening rods for Alexs rejection of them and his pursuit of deeper understanding What a luxury One that we all pursue at some point in our lives and if we have any sense grow out of I was constantly irritated with Alex for hitching homelessness biting every hand that tried to feed him His lonely desperate death not at all surprising and not terribly sad either    except for what it put his family through I had no interest in seeing the movie I saw trailer images of a young man looking off into the wildnerness with depth and intensity and that is NOT the Alex McCandless I got to know in the book If Sean Penn managed to paint a more enlightened image of Alex then he deviated from the book quite a bit   "},

"text": "Alone on a desert island  everything and everyone he knows and loves has been washed away in a storm  Mau is the last surviving member of his nation Hes completely alone  or so he thinks until he finds the ghost girl She has no toes wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird and gives him a stick that can make fireDaphne sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark Shes certain her father distant cousin of the Royal family will come and rescue her but it seems for now that all she has for company is the boy and the foulmouthed ships parrot until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island Together Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things including how to milk a pig and why spitting in beer is a good thing and start to forge a new nationEncompassing themes of death and nationhood Terry Pratchetts new novel is as can be expected extremely funny witty and wise Maus ancestors have something to teach us all Mau just wishes they would shut up about it and let him get on with saving everyones lives Philip Pullman is known perhaps infamously for His Dark Materials trilogy which has been attacked because of Pullmans atheist beliefs as well as the endorsement of atheism that book represents Pullman isnt the only writer to have been attacked due to his view on religion and I doubt that he will be the last one Of course he will undoubtedly be attacked this year because of his new book about Jesus and his buddy ChristI find it strange that there was barely a peep about the books until the movie came outThe problem as I see it with such fame as Pullman receives is that people get hot and bothered either condemning the work or justly defending the work So hot and bothered that books like Nation get overlooked In many ways this is good for no one is trying to ban the book In other ways it is bad for the book doesnt get the fame it deservesTerry Pratchett is a humanist writer of fantasy fiction He wouldnt call his work literature but many of his later novels either is literature or rests on literatures mutable border Ive been a huge fan of Pratchett since Wyrd Sisters made me laugh during a very tough time in my life Thanks Mom for giving the book to me Nation is the best thing that Pratchett has ever writtenNation is LiteratureIm not sure if Nation was inspired by the Tsunami in Asia andor Pratchett receiving his medical news In truth I dont really care I do know for Pratchett himself has said it that Nation demanded to be told and he stopped other projects to write itSupposedly a childrens book Nation tells the story of Mau who loses his whole Nation his whole tribe when a tsunami hits his island home Eventually Mau discovers Daphne a ghost girl who was washed up by the same wave What then follows is part Robinson Crusoe told from Fridays point of view part Swiss Family Robinson part Island of the Blue Dolphins and part religious and philosophical debatePratchetts novels work because each of his characters is like the reader or like someone the reader knows His characters are human and contain one or more aspects of everyone Even Pratchetts most heroic or inhuman characters such as Carrot Rincewind or Death have human traits that effect how they act remember Death really likes cats Here in this book Pratchett presents multiple answers to the questions Why do bad things happen to good people if there is a just god and How do you feel afterwardsBoth Mau and Daphne have tragically lost family Both of their reactions are human yet different from each other Both question the idea of god or in the case of Mau gods and faith Both arrive at different answers More importantly Pratchett doesnt preach he doesnt persuade He just wants the reader to think the conclusion is left up to the reader This makes the book totally honest for there is no clear cut answer to the first questionBesides engaging the idea of the god debate Pratchett touches on another part of creation  where do stories come from Are stories more than just religion Is religion more than story This comes as no surprise to the reader who has read the last two Science of Discworld booksDespite the tragic and bittersweet events of the story Pratchetts trademark humor including footnotes is present in full force Like his characters Pratchetts humor works because it contains an element of human truth As the following exchange showsDont look backWhy notBecause I just did Run fasterThe tale of Mau and Daphne is an adventure tale of two teens surviving the aftermath of a natural disaster They most rebuild They must outwit cold blooded killers and hungry cannibal as well as the odd Grandfather Bird and tree climbing octopus It is a thrillingly story that closely honestly and fairly examines faith science and all in betweenOlder ReviewWhen Nation came out I was a bit disappointed that it wasnt a Discworld novelThen I read itIts the best thing that Pratchett has ever writtenThe one thing about Terry Pratchett as Lawrence WattEvans pointed out is that the only real difference between his adult books and his children books are the age of his protagonists There is no reason why an adult shouldnt treat this as a bookIts a book everyone should readI suppose if Pratchett had the reputation or high profile of Philip Pullman or J K Rowling then there would be a huge cry of how this book should be snatched from the hands of impressable children before they learn how to think for themselves Maybe there is already such an outcry but I havent heard anythingNation reminds me a bit of Island of the Blue Dolphins with much more thrown in Pratchett addresses the big questions of whether or not there is a god and if there is a god why do bad things happen Bad things happen in this book right from the start Pratchett deserves credit for not sugarcoating what happens but for also dealing with the deathes in a way that does not alienate or upset readers okay upset them too muchWhat Pratchett presents for the reader is a book about what extactly faith and life are When one reads Pullman it is quite easy to figure out where Pullman stands in regards to religion It is not easy to figure out where Pratchett stands One character has lost his faith but may or may not be talking to the gods Other characters have faith Neither character is seen as stupid or evil because of a belief or lack of belief In many ways Nation is a more mature novel about faith than Pratchetts earlier tolerance novel Small GodsThis a powerful book and I hope it continues to fly under the radar of those people who think children shouldnt read books that make you thinkEveryone should read this book   Terry Pratchett is a weird and wonderful writer his style is completely unique There really is no other author quite like him and there will probably never be another a true orginal His humour is so strange but remarkably witty Some of the metaphors he uses are just plain genius This is the first Terry Pratchett book I read and I really do need to go and read some more This novel takes place on a wacky island full of strange creatures and even stranger people The islands bananas are pink the trees secrete poison it has tree climbing octopus and stones that are worshipped as gods by the inhabitants Doesnt it just sound like a great place Unfortunately for Mau one of two protagonists in this novel his tribe is wiped out by a great wave that surges all nearby landHe could see that the village had gone The wave had sliced it off the island A few stumps marked the place the long house had stood since for ever The wave had torn up the reef A wave like that would not have even noticed the villageOn the other hand the island itself remains intact Mau however doesnt have a soul He was completing his initiation to manhood when the wave struck he didnt get chance to finish as the initiators all died leaving his transcendence incomplete Whats the poor halfman to do He concocts a death wish plain and simple Theres no reason to live anymore Well until the second protagonists boat Sweet Jude shipwrecks her on the island Ermintrude later called Daphne is a trouserwoman a person from civilisation who is not a tribal and is defined by her cultures wearing of trousers Quite funny really these people are silly trousermen and silly trouserwomen well at least they are to Mau Pratchett has created a brilliant narrative voice for Mau that is ever so evocative of his innocence and of his humorous perceptions of westerners Ermintrude almost shoots him when they first meet and the poor lad thinks the gun is a sparkmaker to help with building fires Is this a frown at imperialism I think so Ermintrude is also a lady who loves to use the etiquette her Grandmother has taught her quite the contrast to Maus tribal standards After the two get over their first hilariously embarrassing attempts of communication and manage to gain a small degree of understanding of one another they must try to survive on the remains of the wonderful island No easy task considering another bunch of people wash up on island including a wise old priest a pregnant mute woman and eventually another family group This is foreshadowed by the approaching cannibalistic raiders that want to kill everyone on the island Mau and Daphne must solidify their newly forming culture with the remains of the old one and learn to surviveThis book was great The writing was superb the plot exciting and the characters well rounded and funny More importantly however Terry pratchett is an uplifting change to those novelists who take themselves too seriously I should read more books like this books that are random and odd Heres a picture of a bird   Dear Terry Pratchett It is entirely unfair that every book of yours I read increases my estimation for you At some point you will no longer be able to live up to my expectations and on that day I am probably going to crySincerely Cait who is thinking about getting a hermit crab tattooI kind of dont want to talk about the plot because Native boy and English girl survive tsunami build empire of survivors and create a nation of science does not convey how awesome it all is Guys this book is fantastic Its about comingofage religion science culture exploration tsunamis the South Pacific mysterious powers behind the throne and also and if you needed an also I am going to point out that you and I might not be able to be friends anymore there are tree climbing octopodes Seriously what more can you ask    Disclaimer Im about to wax poetic in a totally corny way Just warning youI am and have been for years of the opinion that Pratchett is the best writer there is He continually serves up pitch perfect depictions of spectacular characters who are both wonderfully inventive and at the same time purposefully normal And in every book hidden in the hilarity and the side splitting satire is a perfect pearl of truth about human nature I remember when I first found one It was the slender and yet unbreakable thread connecting the commercial idiocy of our Christmas season with a sweaty desperate beast running for its life through a winter night knowing its death was inevitable Hogfather was a revelation for me For years Pratchett fans have been telling anyone who will listen that only the jokes kept Pratchett from being called a literary genius by the mainstream For me Nation is the final proof No story that opens with such souldeep sorrow can be called a comedy There is some humor of course The foul mouthed parrot is hard to miss but even that has a somewhat sinister explanation This is the first Pratchett book that I had to finish in one sitting Always before they were savored over days I knew I could trust Disc World to be alright in the end and if some people met death in the process well hes a pretty good guy all around so wheres the harm in that But Nation is not set on Disc World but much closer to home so I had to stay up until  AM to see how it all ended Death is a much scarier guy in this book although at the end much the same The pearl of wisdom in this book is not small and not hidden Its sitting right out there in the middle of the stage with flashing lights over its head This is about why we believe or choose not to believe In something In anything Its about us but then again it always is even when its also about trolls and dwarves And as always it is the characters that catch me Two seemingly normal individuals made extraordinary by circumstances and the way they react in those circumstances In the end I love Pratchett because he can show me characters that I know are human all the way to their toes and yet they give me hope Mau Vimes Granny Weatherwax even the Patrician they dont do what they do so that people will thank them appreciate them worship them They do what they do because it needs doing and no one else stood up for the job They do the hard jobs they give up certain niceties in life so that at the end of the day all is well not just for them but for everyone It gives me faith that somewhere in this world there are men and women like that It gives me hope that the human race as a whole might be worthwhile In the end all I can say is Terry Thanks   Young Mau is a boy living on an island he knows only as the Nation He has been sent to the Boys Island where he must survive until he can using only the tools of the island build a canoe that will take him on the return voyage to the Nation By doing so he will prove that he is a man and the village will celebrate as he sheds his boys soul and takes on his mans soul Except when he returns there are no fires There are no feasts There is no one to welcome him home What is there is death destruction and the dawning realization that the Nation a powerful island tribe has now been reduced to a population of one If Mau dies then the Nationits heritage its ancestors its religionwill die tooThis book had two strikes against it when I picked it up  its marketed as young adult and  my one foray into Pratchetts writing The Color of Magic was underwhelming So Nation was a very pleasant surprise This isnt young adult literature in the sense that its written strictly for a younger audience but I think it has been labeled as such because the protagonist is young and now that no one is there to perform the rituals that will draw his mans soul to him wonders if hell always be more than a boy but less than a manWhat seems to be a deceptively simple adventure tale on the surface has levels of complexity as it explores issues tied to colonialism existentialism feminism and racism and one must admit thats an impressive collection of isms As Mau works tirelessly to bury the bodies at sea according to custom he begins toas so many do after a traumatic and lifealtering crisisquestion the gods and everything hes ever been taught to believe in This confrontation with the void is complicated by the fact that Mau suddenly hears what may be the voices of the gods speaking directly to him When he comes into contact with whites he questions whether or not his people who seemed to have everything were really inferior savages Now if all that sounds terribly tedious and didactic to you WAITTHERES MORE Theres also action adventure romance and humor There are tsunamis shipwrecks mutineers kings secret passages sharks beer cannons and a foulmouthed parrot And theres a damsel who can take care of herself thank you very muchAnd thats the wonderful thing about this book It causes the reader to think while being entertained And Pratchett accomplishes all of this without being preachy or trying to substitute his answer for your own In fact his message seems to be that you must have faith in somethingwhether its a god a science or a nation As long as what you believe in is good and furthers mankind your faith is not wasted Perhaps his stance is best summed up by one of the charactersEverything I know makes me believe Imo the god of the islanders is in the order that is inherent amazingly in all things and in the way the universe opens to our questioning When I see the shining path over the lagoon on an evening like this at the end of a good day I believe    I just believe You know in things generally That works too Religion is not an exact science Sometimes of course neither is science In Nation as in life there are no easy answers but as in life its one helluva rideCross posted at This Insignificant Cinder and at Shelf Inflicted   "},
{"title": "Thing Explainer Complicated Stuff in Simple Words",
"isbn": "0544668251",
"author": "Randall Munroe",
"text": "In Thing Explainer Complicated Stuff in Simple Words things are explained in the style of Up Goer Five using only drawings and a vocabulary of the  or ten hundred most common words Explore computer buildings datacenters the flat rocks we live on tectonic plates the things you use to steer a plane airliner cockpit controls and the little bags of water youre made of cells I loved the German translation so much that I had to buy the English edition too and of course it was better The book has such an excellent idea that I only really thought about that when I read it in German but in the original you can see what a poet Munroe is and poetry never really translates quite right Here are some of my favorite passages   Rather perversely given that I keep telling people I dont like translations I read Randall Munroes new book in German  but I thought it might help develop my language skills to go through this unusual piece of work where the inventive Mr Munroe spends sixtyone A pages explaining a lot of complicated things using a vocabulary of only the one thousand most common words My feeling is that its done me some good despite the disapproving look I got from one of my germanophone colleagues Youll learn all the wrong vocabulary she sighed shaking her head But Ive hopefully escaped intact my German is good enough by now that Im not likely to believe Bildermacher really is the word for camera or Hochziehzimmer the word for elevator or Himmelsboot the word for airplane Anyway enough about that The content of the book is more interesting than the languageMost people seem to be treating Thing Explainer as no more than a weird bit of entertainment but like Perec in La disparition I think the author isnt just doing it to demonstrate his ingenuity A couple of weeks ago I read an annoying novel called Topologie de lamour which purports to give you an idea of what mathematicians are like The author has evidently met some mathematicians and hes by no means wrong about everything for example mathematicians tend to be very impractical in romantic matters What he missed though is that the interesting thing about them isnt their habit of falling in love with the wrong people but their way of looking at the world Munroes book does a far better job of conveying what that unusual angle isClever people as Munroe says in the introduction typically like to demonstrate that theyre clever by using big unusual words Mathematicians dont exactly refuse to use big words and they can also think its fun to show off this way But in their hearts mathematicians dont want to do this Mathematics is all about reducing things to their essence and that means using as few words as possible If a mathematician could get by using only one word that would make them truly happy Formal logic is the most thoroughgoing expression of this impossible dream Thing Explainer doesnt go to such absurd lengths but Munroe shows that you dont need to know a lot of words to be clever its enough to understand what the words really mean and how they are connected to each other and to the world He gives wonderful concise explanations of things like plate tectonics and how a cyclone forms and the strategy the Mars Rovers used to come down successfully in one piece I learned here how a turbofan works  for some reason I had never got around to finding out He has the best onesentence summary of quantum mechanics I have ever seen About a hundred years ago people learned that the idea of Where doesnt always work for very small things When you describe things in this unusual way you can get a different idea of them and you can think that the big words you normally use are really stopping you from seeing the world instead of helping you see it better Munroe has a couple of deadpan helpfully informative pages on nuclear weapons Machines for burning cities When he gives you a schematic of a Trident submarine Worldending boat and the history that led up to building this interesting device its possible that you may briefly wonder whether it is in fact a good thingOn the last page Munroe shows you the Tree of Life the family tree of all the living things there have ever been who as he says are all related to each other Or to be exact he shows you a tiny part of this tree  which really should contain a branch for every creature alive and the many many more that used to be alive and are now dead He asks you to imagine all the grains of sand there are on all the beaches on Earth And then he asks you to imagine that each of those grains was another whole Earth with its own seas and beaches and how many grains of sand you would have if you added all those beaches together Well thats how many branches you would need to draw if you really drew the Tree of LifeAs he says in the books last sentence next to the world we are talking about all our words are small   Randall Munroes XKCD comic is a delight to read What If was fabulous so I was expecting something even more from Thing Explainer Extremely disappointed By utilizing only the  most common words to write this book Munroe created a confusing mess The simplistic language created a moment or two of cheeky comedy but for the most part it was a confusing in the most annoying sense of the term way to have complex ideas explained Just call it Mitochondria and then talk about how its a bag of water full of bags of water with more bags of water facepalm   I have been a long time fan of xkcd a delightfully nerdy and funny webcomic that has a wonderful mix of science humor and the occasional pun If you like science and humor and arent reading xkcd you need to zip on over there statWhen I heard that Munroe the artistwriter of xkcd announced he was going to put out a book explaining things using his simple yet elegant art style I was excited Here was a person who knew science had a passion for educating the masses about it and had a subtle but wicked sense of humor to help deliver the information And for the most part I greatly enjoyed the book all  very very dense pages of it But I felt the book hamstrung itself a bit too muchIn the course of trying to make this book as accessible as possible a good thing Munroe limited himself to the thousand most common words in the English language While I commend his enthusiasm and goal of making the book accessible to the masses I thought this tactic limited the book in several places This book delves into both the common place dishwashers light elevators and the complex nuclear weapons biological cells computers and while it is nice to have components explained in straightforward ways some pieces are just so complex or specialized that using this plain language is either unhelpful or providesFor instance Munroe typically has to use the word water for liquids and air for all gases Because they were used in some many places it would be easy for a person to get confused and mistake different kinds of water and air In these cases the goal of simplifying the language for the masses could easily result in confusion Maybe if he had upped the number of allowable words to  or  things would have been much clearer and probably still as accessibleBut that doesnt detract too much from some of the great great art and humor in this book Munroe has some very straightforward but detailed drawings of the various subjects with some nice little humorous asides or pictures folded in This book is quite educations and would be a great resource both for children just starting to learn about the world sort of an updated The Way Things Work and adults who just want to learn more about the world Even areas I was already familiar with were shown in a new and humorous light   This book read itRandall Munroe never ever fails to make me laugh Having been indoctrinated to internet humor at a very young age okay so like my late teens with xkcd I was entirely thrilled to learn about What If being released some nine years after that and thats still one of the funniest books Ive ever read I wrote a longform book review about it for my librarys newsletter Its really that goodThing Explainer is just as good I hesitate to use the word better for two reasons  first of all because What If is the book I would have written if I were smart enough to write it which is to say it is exactly my kind of knowledge delivery system using exactly my kind of humor and second of all because Randall Munroe needs to be capped No one should be allowed to be this funny so for the rest of us were going to have to level cap his humor and if I say Thing Explainer is better than theres no point in living except to read more Randall Munroe books It is written using only the one thousand  er ten hundred  most commonly used words in English and he includes a list of those words as well as his reasons for using the list that he did but is written with such a deep understanding of those topics that its impossible not to understand the concepts hes driving at And I honesttogod learned something Lots of things actuallyMy favorite pages in the book were the Red World Space Car Mars rover the Food heating radio box microwave The pieces everything is made of periodic table and of course the Machine for burning cities nuclear bomb If you didnt laugh once after reading that sentence this book is not for you and also we should not be friendsHonestly I posted so many pictures of so many excerpts of this book on Instagram that I should be sued for copyright infringement But it really was just that good and I really did want to share it that much So do yourself a favor go out and get this book and open it up to any page and just read Youll learn something And youll be glad you did   "},

"text": "The Tales of Beedle the Bard a Wizarding classic first came to Muggle readers attention in the book known as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Now thanks to Hermione Grangers new translation from the ancient runes we present this stunning edition with an introduction notes and illustrations by J K Rowling and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales The Wizard and the Hopping Pot The Fountain of Fair Fortune The Warlocks Hairy Heart Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump and of course The Tale of the Three Brothers But not only are they the equal of fairy tales we now know and love reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter                                               I felt very warm and fuzzy reading new JKR How can I not love an alleged childrens writer who mentions murder mutilation cannibalism adultery and bestiality all within the span of  ultrashort pages The stories are on the meh side but Dumbledores commentaries showed a smart literary eye that reminded me briefly of Pale Fire Im all Hey JK you did your thang Be that as it may Im a bit offended by the Dumbledores antiantiMuggle bias I see nothing wrong with witches and wizards not wanting to associate with Muggles I hate Muggles they are the worst And I have Muggle heritage myself but dont tell anyone I said that EEW EEW EEW so you know I cant be magicist Sometimes I look in the mirror and I think Go back to where you came from Mudblood So I did  but the staff at New York Presbyterian wouldnt take me back   I actually started this a few nights ago and would read one story each night but completely forgot to add it to my currently reading shelf I absolutely loved these stories as well as Dumbledores commentary I learned some new things and connected a few others They were such a phenomenal addition to the books especially Deathly Hallows I will forever love The Tale of the Three Brothers and it will always be a classic tale for me I cant believe how much effort JK Rowling put into every single aspect of her series just to make it that much more wonderful I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making This takes so much time effort and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series Every addition to this amazing series brings me so much joy and I cant say enough good things I highly recommend giving these a read You wont be disappointed She gave it her all and I could never give this less than  stars    Im having a hard time deciding which is my favorite tale but Id lean towards The Fountain of Fair Fortune with the The Warlocks Hairy Heart coming in a close second if only it had been executed a little betterKeeping in mind that these are wizarding fairy tales with commentary by Dumbledore and translated by Hermione oh MAN wouldnt it be awesome to get into a crazy discussion about Hermione as a biased translator Dumbledores comments are obviously  biased  the book is really quite cute It shouldnt take you much more than  minutes to read it but I was expecting a short readand honestly my  complaint is the binding t he book just feels awkward and I am dreading when the spine is obviously cracked openSpoilers start hereTale  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot The most obvious morality tale in the book A young man inherits his fathers cauldron and his fathers requests for aid from needy but humble  worthy Muggle neighbors resists with an attitude and is taught a lesson in charity I found Dumbledores notes more interesting than the tale itselfTale  The Fountain of Fair Fortune Almost a Wizard of Oztype story a Muggle Knight and  witches quest for their greatest wish to be granted at the Fountain of Fair Fortune but end up solving their problems on the journey I really think JKR could have expanded this out into much more of a short story although it does make sense in the fablefairy tale format Really quite cute and the happiest of the bunchTale  The Wizards Hairy Heart Obviously the darkest tale a man turns to the Dark Arts and cuts himself off from enjoying life by literally taking his beating heart out of his chest so he will never be hurt Dumbledores notes sort of point towards the ZOMG TERRIBLE HORCRUX IS TERRIBLE idea but never outright says so this Tom Riddle kid TOTALLY ate this one up at the Muggle orphanageOH WAIT HE TOTALLY DIDNTTale  Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump A really stupid Muggle king wants to wipe out witches and wizards gets scammed by a con man but his dishwasher is a real witch and not only stops the persecution but even gets a gold statue through her own cunning I think this was my least favorite out of the Tale  The Tale of the Three Brothers We know this one from Deathly Hallows but  brothers run into Death get the Elder Wand the resurrection stone thing and the Invisibility Cloak Brothers  and  are totally dumb and die pretty quickly but Brother  knows meeting Death is inevitable but hides and lives into old age Again Dumbledores notes are very vague and full of NOW THIS WANDSTONE BUSINESS IS TOTALLY FOLKLORE also can I just say how much the term Deathstick amuses me to no end BUT INVISIBILITY CLOAKS RUUUULE Overall its sort of cool to think how these tales might have played into the upbringing of some of the characters The Weasley kids probably heard all of these  million timesOh AND I forgot my favorite part is when Dumbledore goes into as close as he can get into a rant about censorship concerning the content of the tales the Malfoys across the ages are big into banning books Its even more funny considering HPs history and the fact that JKR was nice enough to let Dumbledore give the gentle smackdown   Now I happened to be at a WalMart at  pm on December third the day before this book was to be released Upon my arrival to the inside of the store I saw a table decorated with a single blue balloon and a plastic tablecloth Taped across the front of the small buffet table was a sign that said Join us at  for Tales of Beedle the Bard Needless to say I squealed aloud with delight and my best friend blushed with embarrassment at being seen in public with a squealing Harry Potter fan I could hardly believe that I had forgotten the realease date for the storybook Harry Potter fans everywhere were waiting for Of course I searched frantically for my wallet but it was nowhere to be found lost in the abyss that is my purse As I began to walk away with my head hung low Kristen the dearest friend Ive ever known then took me by the hand and led me back to the table She told me that she would buy me the book as an early Christmas present but I had to promise to love it And that very night after I had finished the book my promise was kept and I loved it    "},

of these The best thing about this book is that it lets you to hear from Linus and to hear about LinusThere seems to be two points of view Linus as he sees himself and Linus as he is seen by others And it is very interesting to compare these two sites points of view And your own tooThis book may be interesting to people who dont know anything about technology but they are interested in celebrities But it is interesting to people who want to know everything about Linux how it was born how it was developed what did it take to make Linux as we see it today and maybe what it is going to be in future Linus also explains his opinion about open source and copyright which is really interesting More than that he does his best to answer all these questions that people keep on asking him So I strongly recommend the book to everyone whether you know Linus or Linux or not Linus experience is very inspiring   kinda split about this one i went into it expecting a certain character to linus and finding a totally different onei guess i shouldnt be surprised i had the notion of the rockstar shattered many moons ago in the end linus is just another guy with flaws just like anyone else heck linux wouldnt exist if he hadnt accidentially tried to dial the university of helsinki through devhda instead of devtty theres a resiliency and an honesty to him i really like even if he seems to try to avoid every argument despite this he still has lessthanfavorable things to say about gates jobs stallman and tanenbaum to name a few which is good for a few laughs in the end i enjoyed the fact that the book made the legendary linus unremarkably human the pithy technical bits at the beginning were great i wouldnt have liked it as much without them im also not entirely disturbed that the book wasnt entirely composed of them the switching back and forth between linus and david was interesting and added a little extra perspective it also wasnt overused to the point of being annoying which it certainly could have beenlinus does reveal a few philosophical thoughts not just on open source mind you he offers his law of life so to speak interesting as it is it is not a life changing insight nor is really anything else in the booklets face it linus did what he did because he enjoyed hacking and he liked people getting excited about it and providing him new challenges to flex his hacking muscles so he kept doing it he didnt set out to change the world or become rich but he doesnt mind having done either i think if theres anything that i learned from this book is that linux is great because it is a global community projectif lance armstrong can be remembered by its not about the bike then linux should be remembered by its not about the initial creatorthat being said though it was entertaining to know about linus id probably not be recommending this book as much as i might recommend reading the gpl    I thought I might get excited about open source as a conceptbut its a pretty straightforwardly awesome concept so I didnt find anything surprising What IS interesting philosophically is that he comes right out and says This is my life philosophy Its really only touched upon at the beginning and end but sort of exemplified through the whole quirky detailed fun story of this guys life Hes a weird dude both in what he says about his past his attitude toward it and how he acts while being interviewed about it Its strangely relaxing to read He just has this very mellow attitude So I recommend it if youre interested in him at all or feel like a weirdquirky programmer dude or even if you just like memoirs I dont know much about Linux nor did I have any expectations of Linus and yet I found it to be this pleasant reflection on actually DOING something with your life just becausejust for fun                                                                                                                    "},

"author": "Neil Gaiman",
"text": "Nobody Owens known to his friends as Bod is a normal boy He would be completely normal if he didnt live in a graveyard being raised and educated by ghostsThere are dangers and adventures for Bod in the graveyard But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bods family Recently on a car trip with my little boy I decided to try listening to an audiobook In the past this hasnt been a success He loves to be read to in person both picture books and chapter books But he not a fan of listening to books in the car At best hes indifferent but usually he just asks me to turn them off Generally speaking hed prefer to listen to Macklemores Thrift Shop which he calls The Sway Music But hes four now with a vocabulary thats diverse to the point of being a little creepy I taught him cruft yesterday So I plugged in the Audio of Gaimans Graveyard book For those of you who dont know Gaiman reads his own audiobooks more often than not Lovely accent aside hes fucking amazing at it Really irritatingly good We listened to it for about  minutes or so then I heard him saying Dad Dad from the back seat I sighed and turned it off I expected him to tell me that this was boring and we should stop Or that he wanted to listen to the Sway Music or one of his as he puts it Kid CDs But it wasnt anything of the sort instead he said Dad Im listening to the story and I can see the pictures in my head Really I askedYeah he says Its like a movie I couldnt be happier Neil Gaiman as his first audio My boy has good taste What does it look like in your head I ask Theres a hill and on the top of it there is a fence and a graveyard We talk about the story for a little bit Hes slightly confused on some points he thinks the boys name is Jack and he thought that the man who was coming to hurt the boy was invisible except for his hand Which is understandable given the way Gaiman describes things focusing on the hand and the knife But generally he was getting it More importantly he was enjoying it I know this because for the next couple days whenever we got into the car he asked if we could listen to the story of the boy that lived in the graveyard Yes yes we can    Ive noticed that theres been an increased interest in the macabre in childrens literature lately Sometimes when Ive had a glass or two of wine and Im in a contemplative mood I try weaving together a postulation that ties the current love of violent movies into this rise in childrens literary darkness Is the violence of the world today trickling down into our entertainment Hogwash and poppycock and other words of scoff and denial says sober I But Ive certainly seen a distinct rise in the Gothic and otherworldly over the last few years and one wonders if its because kids want more of that kind of stuff or publishers are merely getting less squeamish All that aside generally Ill read a May Bird book or an Everlost title and theyll be fun examinations of the hereafter but not the kind of things that touch my heart Great writing doesnt have to transcend its genre It just has to be emotionally honest with the reader And The Graveyard Book is one of the most emotionally honest books Ive yet to have read this year Smart and focused touching and wry it takes the story of a boy raised by ghosts and extends it beyond the restrictive borders of the setting Great stuffIt starts with three murders There were supposed to be four The man Jack was one of the best maybe THE best and how hard is it to kill a toddler anyway But on that particular night the little boy went for a midnight toddle out the front door while the murderer was busy and straight into the nearby graveyard Saved and protected by the denizens of that particular abode the ghosts and the far more corporeal if mysterious Silas the little boy is called Bod short for Nobody because no one knows his name As he grows older Bod learns the secrets of the graveyard though he has to be careful The man or is it men who killed his family could come back for him Best to stay quiet and out of sight Yet as Bod grows older it becomes clear that hiding may not be the best way to confront his enemies And whats more Bod must come to grips with what it means to grow upCan I level with you You know Coraline Mr Gaimans previous foray into middle grade childrens literature Come close now I dont want to speak too loudly Uh I didnt much care for it WAIT Come back come back I didnt mean it Well maybe I did a tad It was a nice book A sufficient story But it was very much new category alert an adultauthortochildrensauthorfirsttimertitle Gaiman appeared to be finding his sealegs with Coraline He took the old Alice in Wonderland trope which adult authors naturally gravitate to on their first tries see Un Lun Dun Summerland The King in the Window etc Throw in some rats bees and buttons and voila Instant success But Coraline for all its readability and charm didnt get me here thumps chest I didnt feel emotionally close to the material Now why it should be that Id feel closer emotionally to a book filled with a plethora of ghosts ghouls nightgaunts and Hounds of God I can only chalk up to The Graveyard Books strong vision My husband likes to say that the whole reason Buffy the Vampire Slayer worked as a television show was that it was a natural metaphor for the high school and eventually college experience Likewise The Graveyard Book has this strongstrange wonderful metaphor about kids growing up learning about the wider world and exploring beyond the safe boundaries of their homes Theres so much you can read into this book I mean arent all adults just ghosts to kids anyway Those funny talking people whose time has passed but that may provide some shelter and wisdom against the wider crueler world Plus Mr Gaiman also includes characters in Bods world that kids will wish they had in their own Silas a man who may be a vampire though the word is never said is every childs fantasy A mysteriousmagical guardianfriend who will tell you the truth when your parents will notOne thing I particularly liked about the book was the fact that Bod makes quite a few careless or thoughtless mistakes and yet you dont feel particularly inclined to throttle him because of them Too often in a work of fiction a person isnt properly put into the head of their protagonist So when that character walks off and does something stupid theres the sense sometimes faint sometimes not that they deserved it and youre not going to stick around and read about somebody that dumb are you But even when Bod is at his most intolerable his most childishly selfish and singleminded you can understand and sympathize with him Bod is no brat a fact that implies right there that he is someone worth rooting for We see our own young selves in Bod and we root for him as a result And as Bod reaches each stage in his growth he encounters experiences and personalities that help him to reach maturity Thats a lot to put on the plate of a lil ole fantasy novel particularly one thats appropriate for younger kidsAnd it is appropriate too Dont let the fact that the first sentence in the book There was a hand in the darkness and it held a knife put you off The murder of Bods family is swift immediate and offscreen What remains is just a great fantasy novel that has the potential to appeal to both boy and girl readers Kid wants a ghost story Check Kid wants a fantasy novel set in another world appropriate for Harry Potter fans Check Kid wants a good book Thats my favorite request When the elevenyearold comes up to my desk and begs for a good book I can just show them the cover and the title of this puppy and feel zero guilt when their little eyes light up A good book it isI guess that if I have any objections at all to the title it has something to do with the villains Theyre a bit sketchy which I suppose is the point but we live in an era where childrens fantasy novels spend oodles of time defining their antagonists motivations and histories Gaimans more interested in his hero which is natural but the villains raison dtre is just a bit too vague for the average reader Honestly if it werent for the fact that Bods family is slaughtered at the start of this tale you wouldnt necessarily know whether or not to believe that these people are as nasty as weve been toldThat said the books a peach I once heard someone postulate that maybe Neil Gaiman wrote it just so that he could play with the sentence It takes a graveyard to raise a child Unlikely Fun but unlikely I mean he does make a casual allusion that isnt far off from that phrase but he never goes whole hog This book doesnt feel like it was written to back up a joke It feels like a book written by a parent with children growing up and moving out Its a title that tips its hat to kids making their way in the world their pasts behind them their futures unknown This is not yet another silly little fantasy novel but something with weight and depth The fact that it just happens to be loads of fun to boot is simply a nice bonus Highly recommendedAges  and up      This is a summary of this magical sweet and imaginative story for children which in a good tradition of the Brothers Grimm started with a triple homicide   Neil Gaiman does not waste time with unicorns and princesses and butterflies which are often considered acceptable for children He kicks off his book with the brutal murders of a childs entire family written in a chilling tone that made me quickly turn all the lights on in my bedroom Nobody Owens named so because he looks like nobody but himself or simply Bod is the sole survivor of the aforementioned triple homicide who is in The Jungle Book style promptly adopted by a sweet ghost couple in the graveyard inhabited by an afterlife community He even gets a vampire as his guardian and mentor  There were people you could hug and then there was SilasGiven the Privilege of the Graveyard and taught how to Fade into the background Bod spends his entire childhood playing among graves learning his letters from the gravestones running into trouble with some ghouls being tutored by a werewolf with a taste for Eastern European food dancing with Death and making friends with the ghost of a young witch burned at stake He does crave human company though and in addition to becoming an imaginary friend of a little girl also does a brief stint as a nonsoordinary student at a school All this while the evil that tried to murder him in the first place is still searching for himNeil Gaiman has a real knack for the imaginative combination of sweet and creepy elements together with the bittersweet ending creating a unique and unforgettable story which appeals both to children and adults Told via a succession of interludes from Bods unusual life the story could have been overly sugary or overly morbid but Gaiman easily avoids either extreme This story has just the right mix of sweetness whimsy sadness suspense and adventures to keep the reader captivated throughout   Seeing the world depicted through the eyes of a quiet graveyardraised but very human boy colors the story with almost Bradburyesque feeling of nostalgia for the fleeting magic of childhood We see the inevitable process of growing up finding ones self and letting go of the comforts of childhood home written poignantly and sweetly and yet without overkill   Bod is a great character for a childrens story He is smart and resourceful quiet and observant loyal and brave somewhat mischievous and ultimately very lifelike His demeanor reminds me of my awesome younger brother actually Watching him grow up from a sweet child into what seems to be an actual good adult is a pleasure    This story even though wonderfully complete still reads almost like a tease at times Gaiman gives us a delightful and lyrical glimpse into the world which I would love to get to know better He creates such rich captivating characters that even after the book is over I am left longing for more I would love to read a whole another book dedicated to Silas or Miss Lupescu or Lizzy the witch Mr Gaiman if you ever run out of other book ideas just sayin stars and a wellearned spot on my for my future hypothetical daughter reading shelf      This is how it usually goes with me and Neil Gaiman booksScene at the libraryPicks up A couple months later At the libraryPicks up So I was a little hesitant to pick up The Graveyard Book Again the idea is interesting  a toddlers family is killed and hes raised in a graveyard by ghosts  but Gaimans books have seemed interesting to me before So its with gratitude that I sayFinally FINALLY To me this book at long last connected I loved the characters and the concept and the actual text seemed to flow and be more engaging than the previous books Id read Im glad I gave Gaimans books one more last chance after the last last chance I may even try one more   Ive got a doctors appointment scheduled for Monday Maybe Ill ask whats wrong with me I mean why dont I love Neil Gaiman as much as everyone else After all the hype surrounding him I finally gave in and started reading his books Aside from his collection of short stories Fragile Things I havent been as impressed as I expected to be The Graveyard Book in particular I found to be slow moving and depressing Maybe thats inevitable being that most of the characters in it are dead Its not that the writing isnt good Gaimans stories generally arent to blame either in fact there are some flashes of real ingenuity in some of them Coraline and Stardust have been standouts for me personally in this respect I have noticed that sometimes the scene description is lacking There have been moments in the middle of a page where Ive stopped and said wait where is this happening and when I look around all I see are a couple characters in a room about as decorative as the inside of this text block Im writing in right now But those arent common occurrences and theyre certainly not enough to sour the whole bookI dont know if the doctor cant help me maybe Ill seek a second opinion from the librarian    "},

"text": "The literary event of the season a new novel from Ian McEwan as surprising as it is masterful Michael Beard is a Nobel prizewinning physicist whose best work is behind him Trading on his reputation he speaks for enormous fees lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions and halfheartedly heads a governmentbacked initiative tackling global warming While he coasts along in his professional life Michaels personal life is another matter entirely His fifth marriage is crumbling under the weight of his infidelities But this time the tables are turned His wife is having an affair and Michael realizes he is still in love with her When Michaels personal and professional lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways an opportunity presents itself in the guise of an invitation to travel to New Mexico Here is a chance for him to extricate himself from his marital problems reinvigorate his career and very possibly save the world from environmental disaster Can a man who has made a mess of his life clean up the messes of humanity A complex novel that brilliantly traces the arc of one mans ambitions and selfdeceptions Solar is a startling witty and stylish new work from one of the worlds great writers ian mcewan hates you dear reader have no illusions the guy flings more shit and pukes more bile in solar than gg allin ever dared dream check it mcewan dazzles in select passages but the sum aint always more than its parts  which isnt necessarily a bad thing those perfect books with clearly defined themes succinct streamlined yuk you can have em we like the meandering messes shot to shit with all the baggage but at the end of the slop weve gotta feel something its gotta mean something so mcewan throws a lot at us but it aint enough picasso could impress with something he sketched while taking a shit and mcewan the best of his countrymen yup gimme mcewan over rushdie amis or barnes anyday offers up some great characterizations nice acerbic little observations on man in the world hes created for himself some great prose oh that prose this is one reader who kinda loathes those who worship at the altar of the perfect sentence and he readily admits to getting half wood when mcewan waxes poetic etc but solar above all else reeks of one thing fatigue yes mcewans writing about the same old bastard displaying the same old bad behavior all tangled up in the same old rigid story  it doesnt work dramatically or satirically and whatre we left with bullshit a rothmailerupdike caricature with not much to say for itself i challenge a reader to tell me what lies here other than a gratuitously pessimistic view of humanity lacking a morsel of insight or true emotion mcewans running on empty hes tired bitter angry its ugly sorry michelle   The novel is completed He has posted the bulky typescript to his publisher  oldfashioned he prefers this unnecessary gesture to the casual economy of emailing a PDF  and now he is free of the tormented inner voice telling him to reword rejig rewrite rethink He knows it is not as good as his earlier books which sometimes feel as though they were written by a near stranger by a person he only halfremembers being He has poured some of his confusion and disappointment into the novels central character along with other selfloathings his treacherous body his increasingly unreliable memory the stream of women who  God knows why  want to sleep with an aging still famous novelist and to whose insistent demands he occasionally acquiesces Against his better judgement he has taken a sideswipe at his own activities in trying to slow the inevitability of climate change cruelly satirizing the concerned group of likeminded writers who sometimes appear with him on latenight TV programs that few people watch He wonders if anybody will recognize himself but considers it improbable he has moved around the cards thoroughly enough that no one will spot the ladyHe tries not to think about the books many shortcomings The passages which laziness and failing imagination have made him haphazardly borrow from his own and other peoples writing an episode from Enduring Love with the focus slightly changed and Milton replacing Keats the polar bear theme from that Norwegian novel he read a few years ago a whole scene from Douglas Adams Even his timid editor reacted to that last one and with bad grace he has inserted an explanatory passage that puts him in the clear Oddly the thing he feels most distressed about is the letter from his physicist friend who has faithfully read every line and located a few errors Rest mass rather than resting mass And surely you mean Ricci tensor rather than Ricci scalar Ten minutes on Google show hes right but its too much trouble to call the publisher at this stage The worst part he thinks as he pours himself another glass of Macallan is that its good enough He has accumulated an army of loyal fans and they wont desert him at this late hour There is plenty of his trademark prose even if he sometimes lapses into telling rather than showing for pages at a time The opening is strong and will suck people in He has cleverly rearranged the timeline to create the necessary dramatic tension as the plot moves towards a climax as mechanical as that in the only explicit sex scene It will attract a few positive reviews who knows some of them may even be sincere Above all he knows its a pageturnerBut he still feels disgusted with his technical competence and he has marked that in one of the more bitterly selfreferential passages He rereads it and feels an obscure satisfaction Maybe a few other readers will also be amused for a momentHe took the bag in both hands and pulled its neck apart discharging a clammy fragrance of frying fat and vinegar It was an artful laboratory simulation of the corner fish and chip shop an enactment of fond memories and desire and nationhood That flag was a considered choice He lifted clear a single crisp between forefinger and thumb replaced the bag on the table and sat back He was a man to take his pleasures seriously The trick was to set the fragment on the centre of the tongue and after a moments spreading sensation push the potato up hard to shatter against the roof of the mouth His theory was that the rigid irregular surface caused tiny abrasions in the soft flesh into which salt and chemicals poured creating a mild and distinct pleasurepainHe pours a third glass   The main character in Solar cant control his appetites He eats like Jabba the Hut at a casino buffet drinks like an alcoholic fish and chases women every chance he gets Hes also an unorganized slob who would rather just travel or stay somewhere else rather than clean up his own living space On top of being greedy opportunistic selfish and lazy he has no regard for the future He can rationalize any potential warning signs of health issues or unpleasant business hed rather not deal with and just keep living exactly the way he always hasSound like any species you knowMichael Beard is an English physicist who once won a Nobel Prize and has been coasting off that accomplishment ever since Rather than do any more work in physics hes content to give lectures and take a series of figurehead jobs Hes also been married five times and has never been faithful to any of them but wife  Patrice has turned the tables by having an open affair with a workman doing repairs on their houseNaturally the selfabsorbed Beard wants what he cant have and becomes obsessed with winning Patrices love again Hes also taken a job as the titular head of an English think tank working on alternative energy sources and stopping global warming Beard believes in the science of climate change but he figures itll be somebody elses problem after hes dead so hes really only interested in the paycheck A zealous young researcher is driving him nuts by wanting to work on solar energy instead of the worthless wind turbine Beard has committed the institute to buildingA freak accident puts Beard in a position to claim credit for groundbreaking research and just maybe invent a whole new energy industry and save the world If he can put aside his greed and need for instant gratification long enough to make it workClever Mr McEwan Very clever Using a brilliant but lazy man who knows full well that hes courting disaster with his lifestyle and his actions but is just too weak willed to do anything about it as both a potential savior and symbolic destroyer of the world was a nice piece of work    So I imagine young novelists are a promiscuous bunch Writers play around and flirt with all manner of novels date one genre for a few months before finding it oppressive move in too quickly with a voice that turns out to be all wrong for them have onenight stands with forms that are way too experimental And Im sure its great fun for awhile but its not what theyre ultimately after No novelist wants to play the field forever And some do find that special novel early while for others it takes a lot longer time Some never do find it and remain lifelong bachelors which eventually does become a bit tragic a guy in his forties chatting up ironic twists on noir that are way too young for him but Im not talking about them the ones still out tomcatting around Im thinking about novelists who did find the OneIts the match theyve been searching for they settle down and buy a house The novelist and his novel are a symbiotic unit They socialize with other couples in the culdesac their kids all play together The novelists belong to the same club and their novels are close When the novelists take the train in together they ask after each others novel with whom theyre familiar old friendsAnd maybe it goes a little beyond that As happy as each novelist is with his novel after some time he cant help noticing how well the other novelists novel has kept itself up Maybe its all those pilates classes Theres something about the other novelists novels thick red hair and supermeta twist endings As the years go by the other novelists novel starts looking well sorry but novel Because while theres nothing like coming home to ones own novel each night the truth must be told that there is nothing quite like coming home to ones own novel each night and it could also be the truth that these novelists and their respective novels are in a bit of a rut and havent slept together in months You know how it isAll this endless babble anyone still there is to say that I finally figured out what went wrong with fiction this summer Ian McEwan and Martin Amis went to a key party They swapped novels and the results  while perhaps an invigorating experience for each middleaged novelist himself  were far from successful in this readers eyesFull disclosure Im only halfway through Solar right now and am on the fence about whether I should keep reading Any opinions on that I did manage to finish The Pregnant Widow Martin Amiss take on the McEwanesque themes of a bygone era and erotic longings but Im finding this one even less fun See youthful sex in an s Italian castle wouldve been great if McEwan were writing it But Amis isnt lyrical Worse though McEwan isnt funnyMichael Beard the Nobelprize winning physicist of Solar is a classic Amis antihero but with a lot of melted ice That is John Self of Money and Richard Tull of The Information are revolting losers who are driven into the ground by their appetites and too horrifically flawed to be real But McEwan cant pull off the biting stinging nausea thats Amiss sobaditsgood trademark He isnt funny  not to me anyway  and he just cant go gonzo This book has slapstick moments what I suppose was meant to be satire and plenty of scenes that should have been ludicrous But the volumes never up high enough and its all tempered by that patented lovelysentenced restraint The rather bloodless result is something that is not great the way I expect McEwan to be great to be fair Ive only read a couple of his books and certainly doesnt meet the searing demands of the topic hes chosen Martin Amis should be writing about climate change His take on human greed sloth and blind grabbing depravity is uniquely suited to this topic McEwans is not McEwan should be writing stuff like the scene in this book that describes landing at Heathrow but he shouldnt be writing a Martin Amis novel he also shouldnt be writing a Richard Powers novel but thats another rantAnd this really isnt the place to expand on this but to be fair the hollow ineffective and almost comically amateurish ending of The Pregnant Widow might be something McEwan wouldve handled brilliantly Your friend Ians rendition of Once in a Lifetime is inimitable Martin So sit down and watch and dont try it yourselfEnough of an experiment you married that novel for a reason Now go home to her boys and tell her you love her   I was reading in bed last nightI was a little more than halfway throughand it hit me it is taking way too long to read this thing Why Not because its a big book or particularly difficult to understand but because it is so boring I dread opening it each day so I put it off I read anything else I closed it and tossed it aside Im done Ill go find a new one tomorrow at the library Its really disappointing too because when I read the premise it sounded great But McEwan spends so much time on these little details that he forces unnaturally into metaphors that you find you are stuck reading about how the human race is like a healthy spore a few different times a few different ways That particular analogy by the way was pretty good until he pointed it out and forced me to see it rather than letting me come to the relationship on my own The main character is well developed but that doesnt make him any less boring Hes an old man who sucks at relationships and thats another thing we spend every few pages being told Does he do nothing other than think about his past marriages and how to screw up future ones Anyway yes I found this book to be a massive disappointment and must add it as my second book I couldnt finish How depressing is that   "},

authors preferred text never before published in the UK and is about  words longer than the previous UK edition Anybody who tells you that the book is about old and new gods or about a man named Shadow or about coin tricks or about having ones head smashed in for losing a game of checkers is selling you a line because those are just details not the story itselfMuch like any Neil Gaiman story the devil is in the details and you just have to resolve yourself to coming along for the ride or youll miss it Its not one story or two its many and its all completeand you have to just read it and enjoy it and accept it Or just dont botherI might as well sell you a violin as sell this book to you or pluck a synopsis of it from behind your ear and then deposit it in my hand only to have it turn into a critical review while your attention is elsewhere But I wont youll just have to find the magic yourself   In  I walked away from my childhood religion  a high control some would say abusive group with a tiny little worldview and a severe superiority complex This was my realityI believed with all my being that the things depicted above were real and were just over the event horizon Leaving meant losing almost every friend I had ever made since childhood it created a rift with my still devout family and quite possibly saved my life Is it any wonder that fiction  alternate realities fantasy and mental escape  helped me make that decision helped me move on and helped deprogram my cultthink One fiction supplanted the other only this time I already knew I was working with stories Some of this fiction I had read many times not understanding why the stories resonated so strongly within me just knowing that I was compelled to return to those worlds over and over Others were stories I read during the time surrounding my breakaway and shortly thereafterAmerican Gods made me observe and think differently It gave me a new context for the mythologies I had accepted for most of my life It was bigger than the story of Shadow or the girl Sam or Czernabog For me it was about how we allow our Old Gods to define our present worldview and how we allow our New Gods to steal our awareness Our mythologies set the boundaries of our culture and paradoxically as our culture changes our gods sacrifice their immortality   The part of the story that affected me the most profoundly was the story of Hinzelmann and Lakeside The mixing of good and evil the blurring of lines townspeople looking the other way  to such a degree that it never occurs to them to see what is happening right under their noses Dead mens bones Deaths of legends It affected me to my core During the time I was reading American Gods it was this which rocked me  I was doing the same thing  choosing and keeping and killing my own Gods my own mythologies It was tremendously painful made a little easier by having the opportunity to process it within the bounds of somebody elses storyThe rest of the listDuneChapterhouse DuneFahrenheit Animal FarmSandmanCrisis of ConscienceUnder the Banner of HeavenSeductive Poison   Neil Gaiman must have British gonads of titanium to write a huge sprawling epic story about the nature of American belief Its a gamble that worked perfectly  since as he said Nobodys American  Not originally Thats my point the land which has become a melting pot to more than just people It also took in the beliefs they willingly or not brought with them to the New World embraced them changed them allowed some to flourish and others to nearly wither away It pitted the old gods not only against each other in the endless battle for survival but also against the new deities of consumerism and technology for the precious belief that keeps them going To quote Sir Pratchett again But the squabble among the old and new gods is just the surface The heart of Gaimans novel lies in portrayal  through seemingly unconnected interludes and sketches  of the people who brought the legends to this land brought them among blood and loss and sorrow and heartbreak of the people now who live in the this patchwork country that made a whole out of many little bits of their origins and pasts and of the soul of presentday America the glue that holds it togetherAnd to top it all off we are treated to the portrait of a seemingly idyllic very Stephen Kingesque small American town of Lakeside hiding its own dark deep secret Lakeview the quintessential American small town the stuff of legends as one may say Terrifying legends indeedDont be fooled into thinking the excon Shadow working for a mysterious Mr Wednesday whose real identity is not that hard to spot almost immediately is the protagonist No Shadow feels flat and underdeveloped simply because he is just our binoculars into the vast landscape of American mythology this world of belief and legends The imagery that Gaiman creates is stunning He paints a vivid picture with confident brush strokes creating an unforgettable literary landscape And he takes a gamble with the storyline and the plotting as well Do not look for exciting battles and confrontations for nonstop action or fastmoving plot This is the book unfolding slowly and finding its depth in the side stories and interludes that are there not to move the plot forward in the traditional sense but to give an extra glimpse an extra dimension to the unfolding epic picture stars for the unforgettable fascinating fullyimmersing experience Mr Gaiman if you want a title of an honorary American from this awestruck immigrant well  here it is   This is a tough review for me to write Im not exactly sure what it is about this book that I dont like Im not sure there even IS something I dont like Since I dont want to just leave you all with the ever popular Im just not that into it I will try to explainThis book has all the elements of a book I would enjoy The creepiness factor is up there the writing is brilliant the main character is a big lug I couldnt help but love Also I have always been fascinated by mythology so thats a plusShadow is our main character and he just got out of jail after doing his time of three years Right before he is supposed to be released he is let out early because his wife was killed in apparently scandalous circumstances The first ish pages were about the extent of where the book was interesting to me Shadow meets Wednesday and then the story turns into a bunch of mini stories and flashbacks and I didnt enjoy most of them Some were okay but the majority just felt like annoying disruptions and I felt myself thinking this is yet another longer book that could benefit from losing about  or so pages from the dragging middle Shadow is paid by Wednesday to be an errand boy while he travels America trying to rally his troops in preparation for a war between The old Gods and the new Gods media and money I guess its my own fault I couldnt really bring myself to care about this war between the new and old Gods because the Gods of Media and Money Not my GodsBooks that are hyped up as much as this one leave me in a place where I tend to get disappointed because its so hard to live up to those expectations Of course thats not the books fault but I was just expecting to like this book much more than I did I never felt engaged while reading this book and thats the reason I couldnt rate this above three stars I could appreciate the great writing and originality however so I couldnt give it below three starsThree stars it is folks but as most of you know this book is loved by almost all so of course I encourage everyone who is interested in this book already to read it and form your own opinions This book didnt do it for me but I am definitely going to try some of Gaimans other books and see if I have a better experience   Whenever we have a cold snap here in Wisconsin I find myself thinking about one of my favorite pieces of American Gods I remember reading it back in  or so This was back in the day Back when it was a bit of a secret that Gaiman lived in Wisconsin I read the following section of the book nodding to myself thinking Yup thats exactly what its like Then I had another thought I bet this comes from that really bad cold snap we had here in Wisconsin about six years ago It was pretty cool for me being able to guess where a this piece of this book got its start For those of you who havent read it heres the excerpt The main character Shadow has just come to a small Wisconsin town and he decides to walk into town to buy some warmer clothes and groceries    The cold snap had come that was for sure It could not be much above zero and it would not be a pleasant walk but he was certain he could make it into town without too much trouble What did Hinzelmann say last nighta tenminute walk And Shadow was a big man He would walk briskly and keep himself warm He set off south heading for the bridgeSoon he began to cough a dry thin cough as the bitterly cold air touched his lungs Soon his ears and face and lips hurt and then his feet hurt He thrust his ungloved hands deep into his coat pockets clenched his fingers together trying to find some warmth Step after step after step He glanced back The apartment building was not as far away as he had expectedThis walk he decided was a mistake But he was already three or four minutes from the apartment and the bridge over the lake was in sight It made as much sense to press on as to go home and then what Call a taxi on the dead phone Wait for spring He had no food in the apartment he reminded himselfHe kept walking revising his estimates of the temperature downward as he walked Minus ten Minus twenty Minus forty maybe that strange point on the thermometer when Celsius and Fahrenheit say the same thing Probably not that cold But then there was wind chill and the wind was now hard and steady and continuous blowing over the lake coming down from the Arctic across CanadaTen more minutes of walking he guessed and the bridge seemed to be no nearer He was too cold to shiver His eyes hurt This was not simply cold this was science fiction This was a story set on the dark side of Mercury back when they thought Mercury had a dark side This was somewhere out on rocky Pluto where the sun is just another star shining only a little more brightly in the darkness This thought Shadow is just a hair away from the places where air comes in buckets and pours just like beerThe occasional cars that roared past him seemed unreal spaceships little freezedried packages of metal and glass inhabited by people dressed more warmly than he was An old song his mother had loved Walking in a Winter Wonderland began to run through his head and he hummed it through closed lips kept pace to it as he walkedHe had lost all sensation in his feet He looked down at his black leather shoes at the thin cotton socks and began seriously to worry about frostbiteThis was beyond a joke This had moved beyond foolishness slipped over the line into genuine twentyfourkarat JesusChristIscrewedupbigtime territory His clothes might as well have been netting or lace the wind blew through him froze his bones and the marrow in his bones froze the lashes of his eyes froze the warm place under his balls which were retreating into his pelvic cavityKeep walking he told himself Keep walking I can stop and drink a pail of air when I get home  And that my friends is one of the many reasons I love Neil Gaiman    "},

"text": "Every week we pile our garbage on the curb and it disappearslike magic The reality is anything but of course Trashed Derf Backderfs followup to the critically acclaimed awardwinning international bestseller My Friend Dahmer is an ode to the crap job of all crap jobsgarbage collector Anyone who has ever been trapped in a soulsucking gig will relate to this tale Trashed follows the raucous escapades of three something friends as they clean the streets of pile after pile of stinking garbage while battling annoying smalltown bureaucrats bizarre townfolk sweltering summer heat and frigid winter storms Trashed is fiction but is inspired by Derfs own experiences as a garbageman Interspersed are nonfiction pages that detail what our garbage is and where it goes The answers will stun you Hop on the garbage truck named Betty and ride along with Derf on a journey into the vast secret world of garbage Trashed is a hilarious stomachchurning tale that will leave you laughing and wincing in disbelief This book is all about garbage  and its great Following up his excellent memoir My Friend Dahmer a book about actually going to school with cannibal serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer John Derf Backderf takes a look at the American trash industry in Trashed Part fiction part memoir Backderf was briefly a garbageman in  and part nonfiction the facts presented in this book are meticulously researched Trashed follows  year old JB through the four seasons learning the trade of trash collecting Its a juggling act between styles that Backderf manages really well A book that would just list facts about garbage would be too dry and one just about his experiences as a garbageman or the misadventures of the fictional JB would be a bit insubstantial But merged together Trashed is a very strong comic Through JB we see the horrors of being a garbageman maggots in bins bin soup dead cats headless deer diaper bombs when compacted you get flying shit yellow torpedoes plastic bottles of pee tossed out of car windows and the worst of the worst cheap bin bags that break leaving the garbageman to scoop up the trash with his armsTrashed is very informative and the reader will get a brief history of garbage through the ages how recycling works the biodegrading of various materials how trash trucks are designed how landfills operate and the landfills legacy on the ecological landscape These facts are seamlessly woven into JBs story as he encounters them eg when hes picking up dirty diapers there are facts on how many diapers Americans go through and how long theyll take to break down It IS a bit depressing in just how much garbage there is and how our culture has become more enamoured with throwing stuff out over the last few decades In fact Western economies seem built around the short lifespan of products with everyday devices intended to only last a few years before needing to be replaced But as gloomy as it may be its still a fascinating read Backderf makes the book palatable through our likeable everyman protagonist JB a young man disgusted with our societys garbage culture but who approaches it from a practical and light perspective Joining him are a colourful cast of characters like his perpetually pissedoff manager Wile E his flatmate the hipster Magee his colleagues Mike and Bone and Marv the far too old Village Dog Catcher There isnt too much of a plot as its mostly onthejob anecdotes though these are plenty as these episodes are interesting and bring home the variety of crap we throw out The fiction ties it all together even if it isnt a terribly gripping read Trashed is a very Americancentric book and while Backderf briefly mentions the various alternative methods of trash disposal used by Europeans who dont have the luxury of endless space like America I wouldve liked to have seen a wider look at the issue Backderfs conclusion at the end seems to be bigger landfills in remoter places like Alaska which seems a bit pointless when there are better methods out there than simply burying the problem Then again theres real money behind landfills so I guess Americans are stuck with the crap solution for nowA book about garbage doesnt seem the likeliest choice for a good read but Derf Backderf pulls it off in Trashed Its entertaining and a little sad but very revealing its one of the most memorable comics Ive read all year Definitely worth checking out   Technically this is impressive in alt comics style and listed as fiction though it is a mix of memoirpersonal experience as once Backderf worked in sanitation and nonfiction with some background based in research on trash Backdoor started this is as a memoir as was his My Friend Dahmer but he didnt have enough for a full length project so he shifted into fiction I seem to be in a minority here but I am not that into it I guess it is a cool enough portrait of a working class job though I didnt care that much for the characters really Its hard for me to catch the tone Its not that funny It doesnt tell me much that I didnt already know about American consumption and waste and trash piggery The art is great though and he is a talent in that respect this is his best work   Ive read Backderfs work since My Friend Dahmer but this is the first longform work hes published since the  book This is another wonderful book and for different reasons As the author makes clear in his introduction while this has roots in personal experiences Trashed is not autobiographical in nature as was My Friend Dahmer Hes written this instead as a work of fiction There are strains in the narrative that do seem to have autobiographic leanings or at least theres the feel of thatbut then again what work of fictional narrative doesnt have some links to the life experience What mitigates the fictional tone of the work are the informative factfilled sections that intersperse the story proper Its as if the protagonist  or Backderf himself  is momentarily stepping in to give us some data on garbage collection before getting back to the story of JBs experiences in his village service office These sections  citing EPA studies and other research  read more like memoir or documentary than fiction   What happens to your trash Who takes it away Where does it goFind out daring readerOkay so its not the most exciting topic in the world Its trash The stuff we dont want anymore But this book does a good job of mixing the factual stuff with the vignettes about smalltown lifeI wont tell you all the dirt on garbage but there IS a section in here that briefly mentions how Denmark uses new fancy incinerators that burn garbage to generate power and I was intriguedIt turns out that these are totally legit Burning garbage is potential method of getting rid of trash Granted the carbon emissions are a problem but I dont know how much worse that is than the way Americans dispose of their trash want to know more READ the bookWhats more interesting is that the incinerators have demonstrated that trash is more of a social problem than a scientific oneI read an article about Denmarks incinerators and it pointed out that there was a problem Not with the incinerators themselves but with the way that incineration to generate power deincentivizes waste reduction and recycling The incinerators require a certain amount of trash to run at maximum efficiency and so if I want to power my house this winter a certain number of bags need to hit the curb every week None of that stuff about the problems with the incinerators is in the book but it underscores the books message which is that the problem has a lot less to do with biodegradation and such and a lot more to do with the fact that we buy too much stuff it breaks too quickly and we toss it out and start overPeter   Once the scene was set I got into it The anecdotes were good and it was kinda a mix between Harvey Pekar and Bukowski if I can be so bold as to make two obnoxious references in one sentenceQuick tangentI wonder why it is that when I hear someone say Charles Bukowski is one of their favorite writers I instantly have an opinion of that person And that opinion is almost always Yeah thats what I thought I dont think its just about people who like Bukowski its about people who like him A LOT and cite him as a favorite author As a founding member of the Bad Dad Club I feel like this Bukowski love is an opinion often expressed by members of the Bad Dad Club Male and female by the way Dont get me wrong I really like a lot of his work It just seems that theres a certain type of person who really likes Bukowski and really needs you to know they really like Bukowski Someone in sciences needs to get into literature and start doing some studiesAnyway TrashedThe start was rough And I think its because the dialog was kinda clunky Stuff likeHey isnt that old man Jenkins Who runs the general storeYes it is And of course his wife is with him who we also knowTheres this thing I tried to express before in a review of a play about dialog and how it works and doesnt work and then I read this article about Mad Max Fury Road that crystallized the whole thing for meHeres what director George Miller says about dialog And he says it with the fancy ue ending as he would catalogue or egg nogueAt a simple level youre not trying to use dialogue as exposition youre using it as part of behaviour and language itself is distortedThank youue Dialog can be really grating as exposition and really effective as characterization Dialog tells you a lot not through the information contained in sentences but the language used and the way things are said I think this is especially true and noticeable in film plays and comics because they have the expository visual tools to carry some of the load as well so when dialog is used as exposition its extra painfulI was about to say that I give expository dialog in written stories a pass because pure prose doesnt have the visuals to rely on but that would be a lie I dont give anyone a pass on this I wont call Trashed lazy because its not lazy but when I write expository dialog its laziness Always Its a failure of imagination to show and demonstrate something in a better way And because its something Im sensitive to myself its something that sticks out for me in other works tooOh also this book has information about trash sprinkled throughout and this info confirms two longheld suspicions of mineRecycling dont do shit Seriously The amount of trash and especially the amount of toxic material in landfills is going to bite us in the ass And the way landfills are run doesnt help Garbage is compacted into large cubes which are stacked on each other and compressed and when its all said and done what theyve got is a huge pile of cubes buried in the ground and compressed so tightly and without air moving through and therefore biodegradation isnt really happening And whats more newer landfills are equipped with drainage for the toxic poisonous liquids that escape and in a recent test it was found that  of these systems leakedAlso children result in mounds of diapers Like huge And those dont biodegrade at all You could recycle your entire life and still not make up for those couple years of PampersThe problem has a lot less to do with lack of recycling than it does with consumerism and planned obsolescence Im not going to get all corporate warrior and shit but if you get rid of your phone because a newer version is out you are fucking up big time Those components are terrible for the environment they dont break down and the less of it we consume the less is manufactured Recycling is a drop in the bucket compared to consumer waste Now Im not a person who thinks that we shouldnt bother with something just because its small stakes It takes a lot of small changes to make a big change What Im saying is that you cant put out the green bin and be all Im a good steward of the environment and then throw a flatscreen in the dumpster the next dayGet products that last repair and refinish stuff when you can and just generally avoid throwing shit out Focus more on reducing the number of bags at the curb not where those bags are going  Europe is smart and America is dumbAgain Im not one of these assholes whos like If Trump becomes President Im moving to Sweden Because no Im not and you arent either Did you guys know that Denmark has fucking incinerators that generate heat and power From trashOkay there are some issues Not so much environmental like youd think but social People in Denmark recycle very little and are not incentivized to reduce waste because waste is what powers shit and screw it were good So there is a movement afoot to continue reducing waste and recycling even though these incinerators are kinda awesomeBut Ill say this Most waste in the US is shoved in the ground and poisons the area Wait lets back up Most waste is trucked to a facility where its then trucked via semi to a dump Goodbye to the local dump hello to the mega dump Which isnt the worst thing IMHO because there are some desolate parts of this state that nobody would miss But the problem as I see it is that were trucking around garbage Thats a crazy waste of resources To put that much time and effort into something were trying to get rid of is pretty crazySo while Denmark might not be totally in love with its incineration process its a fuck of a lot better than taking trash for a drive   "},
{"title": "The Last Lecture",
"isbn": "1401323251",
"author": "Randy Pausch",
"text": "We cannot change the cards we are dealt just how we play the hand  A lot of professors give talks titled The Last Lecture Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them And while they speak audiences cant help but mull the same question What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance If we had to vanish tomorrow what would we want as our legacy When Randy Pausch a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon was asked to give such a lecture he didnt have to imagine it as his last since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer But the lecture he gaveReally Achieving Your Childhood Dreamswasnt about dying It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles of enabling the dreams of others of seizing every moment because time is all you haveand you may find one day that you have less than you think It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe It was about In this book Randy Pausch has combined the humor inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form It is a book that will be shared for generations to come I sat down to write my review of The Last Lecture on Friday July th Before I started to write I decided to check Randy Pauschs website for any updates on his condition He had died that morning at the age of  The book and the lecture itself now take on new meaningFor those who arent aware Randy Pausch was a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University The university has a tradition of inviting professors to give a lecture where they pretend that it is their last chance ever to talk to their students What would you say What wisdom would you impart What are your lessons in life For Randy this was not a hypothetical question Barely a minute into the lecture he introduced the elephant in the room advanced pancreatic cancer that would kill him in a matter of months With this revelation out of the way he gave a talk about achieving your childhood dreams and enabling the dreams of others The lecture was so full of optimism clarity hope humour and sincerity that the YouTube video went viral and a few months later it was published as a book The Last Lecture contains everything that Randy covered in the lecture plus some other anecdotes and pearls of wisdom from his life and experienceLike the lecture the book is earnest and straightforward Randy tells a story then gives us the moral in case we missed it He fills his stories with humour occasionally laugh out loud What comes across most strongly is his deep love for his wife and children who he knew he would be leaving behind Its hard to read this book and not have a good impression of the author He seems like a great guy someone that you would love to have as a mentor or friend I think this is reason that the lecture was such a success his personality makes a watcher puts more stock in his words This still comes across in the book although not as strongly as in the lecture In fact without seeing him on video and hearing him speak the words reading the book can almost get a bit tiring I recall thinking on a number of occasions Ok we know that youre a really smart guy who works really hard and never gives up you dont need to keep telling me Some of the advice in the book especially that which goes beyond what he said in the lecture can be a bit tough to swallow For example his advice to always carry  in cash in your wallet does he think that only the upper middle class are going to read this book Similarly he often speaks of the great mentors friends and supporters that he has had through his life not everyone goes to a university where the professors have such extensive connections to facilitate their students careers Finally his advice to never give up Brick walls are not there to keep us out they are there so we can show how much we want something sometimes comes across as as sense of entitlement He never says to expect something for nothing but does imply that anything you want to achieve is possible if only you work hard enough at it Advice like this sometimes crosses the line into sappiness and glurge Fortunately these moments are fairly rare and as long as you dont read the book in a single sitting which is quite possible then you probably wont feel too overwhelmedInterestingly shortly after I watched the last lecture on YouTube a student of mine asked me a similar question to the topic of the last lecture What do I consider my most important lesson in life so far It is quite a difficult question to answer Im sure that I dont have the life experience to give a good enough answer but its quite possible that this student was bright enough to recognize that and learn something from the incompleteness of my relatively uninformed response I hope that someday I can have the kind of perspective that Randy shows in the lecture and the book We need people like Randy who have a clear picture of what they have learned in life and who are willing to share it Regardless of whether you or I agree completely with his advice what shines through is that this was a man who lived his life according to principles that he believed in and that he thought others would benefit from hearing His life lecture book and his death remind me of a quote from Dr Howard Thurman Dont ask yourself what the world needs Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that Because what the world needs is people who have come alive Even as he lived the last few months of his life I know that Randy was truly alive   My review of this book will not be popular but I must be honest Im halfway through this book and although I appreciate a positive voice its really not that interesting or helpful If I could sum up this book in three words they would be yay for me The author tells us how great his childhood was then that he accomplished all his childhood dreams got the girl of his dreamsetc etc etc Its really not a book how to better your own life as much as it him telling us how great his life has been Yes I realize it was born from a lecture but maybe every life achievement and event in this world doesnt necessarily need a book to be made about themHaving said all negative stuff Mr Pausch sounds like a good guy   While this man has a star attitude I can only give the book two yeah everyone is raving about this guy Five star attitude the author gets diagnosed with terminal cancer He refers to this as an engineering problem understated and true has  months to live tops Has  small children ages  and underwho will never know him he was scheduled to give a last lecture ya know how to live your life as if you were dying irony and he writes it in such a way that its a celebration of his life his children will know who he was and what he believed in a story of how life can throw brick walls in your way and you have a choice to stop or go around them play the cards you get dealt instead of bitching about themI applaud the great attitude he takes to enjoy the time he has left and focus on what matters But is this earth shattering Is any of this a surprise   I was first introduced to Mr Pausch while watching the Oprah show in the fall My father in law was in the hospital at the time fighting melanoma that had metastacized to his lungs Simply stated I stopped folding clothes and cried so hard during that show Soon after the emails began to circulate with links to the last lecture on utube and I watched every link I got and cried even more I read all the internet articles and was touched every time When I saw the book was coming out I jumped on board and knew I had to read it I never knew how emotional this book would be for me The day August   Randy Pausch got the devistating news that his cancer had spread and there was nothing the doctors could do anymore is the same day that we arrived at MD Anderson with my father in law knowing things were not right I came across this in the book and had to put it down for days This was just hitting too close to home for me I finally was able to pick it back up and continue This book and Mr Pauschs stories are so touching and true that we can all find something in there that will help us want to be a better person We can all find some bit of wisdom that can be carried into our lives I cried so many times reading this but I laughed several times too Anyone who has had their life touched by cancer will benefit from the optimism Mr Pausch has but it will be a very difficult read just because of the seriousness of the issues at hand Just the sheer optimism in such a negative world is very upliftingI ran across several quotes from the book that I felt were so important that I needed to use my trusty post it notes to mark them for future reference Here they are Pg  The brick walls are there for a reason Theyre not there to keep us out The brink walls are there to give us a chance to how how badly we want something Mr Pausch refers to the brick walls so many times but it is so truepg Time is all you have And you may find one day that you have less than you think This has been a major realization in my life this past year We thought we had so much time with my father in law And we lost him so quickly Take the time to do the things you want and never put them offpg  Luck is indeed where preparation meets opportunity This goes back to my old Girl Scout motto Be preparedpg Experience is what you get when you didnt get what you wanted Glad to know Ive gotten something And now it makes sensepg A lot of people want a shortcut I find the best shortcut is the long way which is basically two words work hard Wow If we could all stop taking the shortcuts and work a little harder could imagine what might happenpg All you have is what you bring with you This is the chapter title and it sure says a lot   I think this was one of those books where knowing the criticisms before starting it ultimately upped my enjoyment factor Randy Pausch the author was one of those people who became wildly popular in  thanks to the internet He was a popular professor at Carnegie Mellon and was invited to give a last lecture a tradition of sorts where a professor is urged to give a specially prepared lecture as though it were the last she were to ever give And so they are encouraged to break down all the knowledge learned in their lives and during their careers into one hourlong presentation and say this is the best of what I know here you go But for Randy Pausch his Last Lecture became somewhat of a sensation because shortly before he was scheduled to give his presentation he learned that he had latestage pancreatic cancer and he only had  months left to live Throughout it all he remained very upbeat he was charismatic and his nerdy persona was infectious And so copies of the lecture spread and spread and spread over the internet and suddenly Pausch was an overnight sensation Only in America Given his shortened life span at the time of publication I can understand why the book felt so rushed There are some chapters that are little more than a couple paragraphs with a random anecdote that doesnt really have anything to do with anything And many of the longer ones appear to be runons About halfway through the book I realized that each chapter of this book reminded me of a blog entry Then I realized that that may be some of the appeal to this generation because as a piece of literature this book is justwellno This book came highly recommended to me by my sister and my mom who love it My motherinlaw has read this book and also loves it And at the time I write this review  star and star reviews on GR and there are fewer than  ratings that are  stars or less so Pauschs story has clearly touched the lives of a lot of people Since discovering this site I almost always scan some of the topvotegetting reviews before starting a book Whether someone loved it or hated it Im always curious to know why And in the case of this book since there were so many glowing reviews I found myself focusing on the negative ones if only because they appeared to be in the minority and the minority has always intrigued me Most of the complaints had to do withthe fact that Pausch sucks as an authorPauschs personalitywhat did this guy do so differently that he actually deserved a bookthe book is too preachyits too Hallmarkyits too DisneySo going into the book expecting these faults I found myself focusing on what is probably the most important thing about this book Randy Pausch who isnt alive anymore had three children under the age of five who may not remember that once upon a time he was their father who loved them very much And realizing that this year next year five    years from now his children will still have a record of who he was and what he stood for whether I agree with all of it or not is an unbelievably beautiful thing My husband was a teenager when his mother died unexpectedly and years later we still have items in our home that belonged to her a set of watercolor paintings shed had since college a handwritten recipe on a postit note a baby book full of handwritten notes and stories and photographs Having that connection to the past is a tangible reminder not only of what was lost but of where we come from And losing a parent before their time makes that connection even more powerful And so I cant help but feel glad and happy for Randy Pauschs children because they will grow up knowing that their dads life inspired so many millions of people I hope that will be a tremendous source of pride for them They cant have their dad but the legacy he left them was the best he had to offer in the short amount of time he was given to work with    "},
{"title": "The Bourne Supremacy",

"author": "Robert Ludlum",
"text": "   Re enter the shadowy world of Jason Bourne an expert assassin still plagued by the splintered nightmares of his former life This time the stakes are higher than ever For someone else has taken on the Bourne identitya ruthless killer who must be stopped or the world will pay a devastating price To succeed the real Jason Bourne must maneuver through the dangerous labyrinth of international espionagean exotic world filled with CIA plots turncoat agents and evershifting alliancesall the while hoping to find the truth behind his haunted memories and the answers to his own fragmented past This time there are two Bournesand one must die  in the Bourne trilogy This book didnt have some of the elements that made the first one so great but it had a few things that werent there in the first book that I liked namely the distinct seperation of David Webb the mild mannered husband and Jason Bourne the highly trained killing machine who cares for nothing but himself Ludlum actually creates three different characters in the same body David Webb Jason Bourne and Delta Webbs codename during his time as a heartless American guerrilla fighter in earlys VietnamThe story sarts with  who has Webb had  years of peace and therapy and has mostly put his past as the psuedoassassin Jason Bourne and his chaotic years in Vietnam behind him Suddenly he is plunged back into the covert ops world that he has been trying to forget This time allied with his once enemy and long time friend Alex Conklin no he doesnt die in the first book like in the movies he must fly to Asia and kill a new assassin who is using the name of Jason Bourne What I liked most about this book was the inner struggle between Webb and Bourne Webb is weak and slow but he is capable of emotions like love and empathy Bourne on the other hand is a void of emotions with the exception of hate and anger and is highly effective for it As the story goes on you see less and less of Webb and more of Bourne By the end Webb is virtually gone and Bournes anger and hate gives way to Delta who was the origianl killer a persona so filled with rage at losing his first family during Vietnam that he joined an American guerrilla force just to be able to kill This part of the story kept me enthralled through the entire book Also in this book you see Bourne as a hunter and not running for his life He appears more clever and deft in this book than in the first The cons in this book were about the same as the first The characters talked way too much and it felt like they kept going on tangents that werent really important to the story And Webb and Marie reached whole new levels of romantic barfness during this book But overall  I still loved this one It wasnt quite as complex as the first book but there was more action in it It was more of an inyourface kinda action suspense book but it came off great I recommend it to anyone   Well this was the worst book Ive read in a long time Where to start Its bloated racist and dull The scenery is a bit interesting and the plot from the first hundred pages or so appeared just convoluted enough that I wanted to see what happened in the end or I would have been done with this book by the end of half an hour But I soldiered onIn the end the book was far less interesting than the Bourne Identity perhaps because there was less for Bourne to do as the man being manipulated rather than manipulating everyone else Characters also really suffered here Bournes internal conflict was just a throwback to the previous novel and we waste approximately  pages on his split personality ramblings Marie was far less formidable than in Identity Really only one character emerged in this book who was genuinely interesting Echo Philippe dAnjou returns from the previous novel seemingly a different character this time around more of a magnificent old commando bastard and mentor figure Alexander Conklin also gets some magnificent old CIA bastard screentime This was worthwhileAs for Ludlums take on Asia Asians and Asian politics the term facepalm seems most appropriate Nearly every Asian character is a stock stereotype Bribe the avaricious Chinese is basically the main way the plot moves forward Oriental is a frequent noun theres racist language and all the characters involved in political plotting on the Chinese side are fanatics inspired by the Cultural Revolution Oh and theres a kung fu sidekick who teams up with Bourne after he is defeated obviouslyFinally as a Canadian I was annoyed by Ludlums basic failure of continuity from the first book and massive factual errors Calgary is not in Ontario Calgary is really not in OntarioIf I owned this book as a physical object rather than a digital file I could have chucked it against a wall But that would break my Kindle What a pity   First and foremost this book has absolutely nothing to do with the movies that recently came out Sure they share the same title but let me reassure you they have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the movie The only thing that is kept from the book and transferred into the movie is the fact that Bourne is killers killer if you dont believe me just watch the movie He kills a man with a TOWEL All that being said I found this to be a quite enjoyable book It takes place in China Apparently someone has taken up the Jason Bourne monniker and started assassinating Triad members The real Jason Bourne whose real name is David Webb is to say the least furious and this fury is further fueled by the kidnapping of his wife Marie After that David Webb goes back to being Bourne in order to find his wife and to kill the man who is impersonating him I really enjoyed this book because it keeps the sense of action that movies have It also is really suspenseful and keeps you glued to the page I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys espionage novels   My first thought will give you an idea of how this book reads I am so happy to be done with it The plot is terribly complex and if you are clueless about the Far EastChina and try to follow it good luck to you The book and the movie are not similar and this is one of the rare instances where I found the movie better than the book In the movie his wife is killed right away Not so in the book The wife annoyed me to no end Heres what I thought of thatAs for the economic genius Marie St Jacques I find it astounding that to conceal her appearance all she has to do is  push back her gorgeous red hair  not wear makeup  wear flats instead of heels  not wear form fitting clothing Wow  instantly unrecognizable So I guess she normally has a red Afro wears clown makeup  inch heels and a body suit You know a man is writing this If Marie is so smart then why do her stupid clues not work with Bourne but alert McAllister And my God could she be more obvious Maple tree Shes Canadian for Petes sake Finally I liked Bourne and DAnjou working together It reminded me of Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobe    That difficult middle book in a trilogy This time Bourne is tricked into heading to Hong Kong to track down his kidnapped wife Except its all a government plot to get him to assassinate a rogue Chinese leader who is threatening the stability of the regionA frantic chase across the US China and Hong Kong Involving the Chinese American and British secret services This book was pretty unputdownable  including several late nights where my arms were unable to support the book any more Sadly the ending felt a little rushed and a little too neat but that hardly detracts from the book

good one in this excellent cozy mysteries series set in Medieval England in Shrewsbury near the border to Wales My next one will be Monks Hood It feels repetitive to write another review please see instead these two reviewshttpwwwgoodreadscombookshow for The Leper of Saint Giles and httpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshow for St Peters FairI highly recommend the series They do NOT have to be read in order except  and  have to be read before  say my friends The first one is not one of the best so beware Dont be put off if you insist on starting there You get delightful writing and a clear mystery that is fun to follow and filled with action The monks are great characters each with their own particular idiosyncrasies They become real people because in all the books their character doesnt change so the more you read the more you enjoy going back to meet them again Some are nicer than others so dont think this is totally unrealistic These characters are more than nice versus bad they are unique individuals one LOVES anything to do with music another has a good heart but always breaks things and makes messes and then of course there is Brother Cadfael pronounced Cadfile He is Welsh worldly has fought in wars been to the Holy Lands and now has returned and fills out his monastical duties working in the Abbys herbarium and solving crimes Oh I forgot I was going to keep this very short My advice dont start with book one Start with my favorite so far The Leper of St Giles The Sanctuary Sparrow is almost as good but the mystery was a teeny bit harder to follow As usual all the threads tie up nicely As usual Brother Cadfael explains how he thinks for us the Deputy Sheriff Hugh Beringar and the Abbot As usual the writing is NOT salacious but lovely As usual the crime gets solved and each get their fair due in one way or another You recognize a lovely constancy to how the stories unfold and are resolved Lovely series I just couldnt keep my mouth shut could IThe narration of the audiobook by Vanessa Benjamin was absolutely wonderful No complaints whatsoever   In this one of my favorite Brother Cadfael stories and also the first one I read long ago on a trip to Britain attention again returns to the roles and lives of medieval women but this time the focus is on the middle and lower classes From the dramatic opening when the peace of the monks nightly office is shattered by a mob from the town pursuing a ragged traveling entertainer accused of murder to the even more dramatic climax this Brother Cadfael will keep you turning the pages and then being sorry when its done and wanting moreBrother Cadfael pronounced Cadfile has definitely entered the ranks of great fiction detectives alongside Sherlock Holmes and Lord Peter Wimsey But these stories are more than just murder mysteries in medieval drag Ellis Peters actually lived in Shrewsbury England where Cadfaels monastery of St Peter and Paul can still be visited Her knowledge of the land and people and history permeates her work and gives her the incredible gift of transporting her reader into the past You really do feel as though you are in that longlost world lit only by fire where its quiet and green and life moves at a pace most people can be happy inCadfael is a suitably complex man Hes from Wales but now living in England though Wales is not very far away He was once a soldier but now hes a monk Hes lived a full life now he wants to be quiet But he also has a strong sense of right and justice and refuses to compromise on these things even when it means getting himself in trouble Hes also picked up a lot of knowledge especially of herbology and medicine and somehow for the time logical analysis that stands him in good stead as a solver of mysteriesAnother charming step along the journey of Cadfael   Ive come late to the Cadfael series having first watched the television adaptations starring the magnificent Sir Derek Jacobi Though this is the seventh in the Cadfael series it was the first I read since this particular adaptation was probably my favourite Peters has an amazing eye for historical detail and her knowledge of such varied things as botany criminology psychology and the human heart is as impressive as it is extensive Brother Cadfael is a medieval Gil Grissom in a habit but with more humanity and emotion than that modern counterpart The religious aspect of the novel is never heavyhanded or overpowering every character  even the minors  is three dimensional and believable and the love stories at the heart of the mystery will pull at your heartstrings in an entirely sincere fashionA wonderful read for anyone whos interested in history Medieval Britain mystery and the television adaptationsA in my book Ms Peters Brava   Ellis Peters again delivers a wonderful historical mystery Brother Caedfael often helps people in love In this book there are three couples each couple very much in love but in three very different ways The action of the story comes about naturally from who each person is and comes to light just as naturally Ms Peters does seem prone to the trope of the first suspect is never guilty but I hadnt realized it until just now She doesnt beat you over the head with it Frankly by about half way through this novel I had at least three different theories about who did what and why all of them supported by the facts revealed that far And had I not been so very caught up in the excellent writing and the wonderfully real characters I could have figured it out  all the information was there But I preferred to stay immersed in the time and place of the story than take the time to work out the plot ahead of time    The Brother Cadfael books are always enjoyable The characters are great and her descriptions of scenes make everything real and bring you back to th Century England In this book a young jongleur has managed to make his way to sanctuary just in time to avoid being lynched by a mob of villagers who are certain he murdered and robbed his employer As always there are so many more underlying stories and Brother Cadfael is instrumental in solving the mystery and bringing peace to the lives of

"text": "From National Geographics Explorer of  featured in The New York Times Magazine Wild By Nature is the harrowing and nearly unbelievable story of Sarah Marquis solo mile hike across the remote Gobi desert from Siberia to Thailand then transported by boat to complete her hike at her favorite tree in AustraliaRelying on hunting and her own wits Sarah Marquis made it across six countries where she survived mafia drug dealers thieves on horseback who harassed her tent every night for weeks temperatures from sub zero to scorching lifethreatening wildlife a dengue fever delirium in the Laos jungle tropic ringworm in northern Thailand dehydration and a lifethreatening abscessThrough an incredible journey Wild By Nature explores what it is to adventure as a woman in the most dangerous of circumstance what it is to be truly alone in the wild and why someone would challenge themselves with an expedition others would call crazy Originally a bestseller in France selling over  copies Wild By Nature will appeal to fans of Cheryl Strayeds Wild Wild by Nature is the account of the  mile hike that Sarah Marquis made across Mongolia China Siberia Laos Thailand before a journey on a cargo ship and then a further walk across the Australian Outback Whilst she had backup and sponsors Sarah undertook this walk solo Not only is this a huge physical achievement she had to stay sharp whilst facing thieves drug dealers tropical diseases lethal wildlife life threatening illnesses and natives who were not always best pleased to see a foreigner She had to cope with freezing temperatures in the Gobi desert scorching temperatures in the Australian deserts being blasted by the winds on the Mongolian Steppe and survived some unbelievable thunderstorms It is quite an challenge for anyone to undertake but for a single woman in some of these countries it is even more of a trial This is not her only achievement wither she has walked  countries in total earning herself the National Geographics title of Adventurer of the Year She is tenacious and stubborn two qualities that you need to push yourself to the physical and mental limits that a walk like this demands but there are times even for her when it all seems too much But I think that there are a few things that let it down a little one is that her journey seems to jump around somewhat without following any logical route I would expect a journey of this type to flow nicely but it doesnt You got a good sense of her emotional highs and lows but it was also difficult to connect to her as a reader at times This is one worth reading if you like walking books but could have been much better   Let me start by saying that Im a self confessed armchair adventurer With the likes of Ed Viesturs Ive gone up K With George Grinnell Ive witnessed travesty unfold on the barrens of Canada and with Tabor Ive descended amazingly deep within the bowels of the earth Ive also walked with woman hikers Jennifer Pharr Davis in CALLED AGAIN and Patricia Herr in PEAK BAGGING and Cheryl Strayeds WILD just to name a fewAnd I mention all these titles for two reasons One to let you know what literature is out there if you are just getting started with your own armchair adventuring and two to show that I have a fairly good grasp of what the literature looks like Which is to say that I almost know what Im talking aboutSo WILD BY NATUREThe first thing I noticed was that you can tell that an American didnt write this book The author is Swiss I believe and speaks French Certainly her sentence structure and thought processes seem European to me So that was not lost in converting this book to English Her world view though is different and that took some getting used to The second thing I noticed and which is of a lot more importance is that the book is not written like a diary or a reconstruction of a story based on a diary Its more remote like she had no written record to call upon and maybe thats why I never felt like I was there with her When I climbed with Viesturs I felt the cold and the lack of oxygen I didnt feel the  degree heat of MongoliaAnd what is more distressing than the lack of immediacy is that the author has edited out thoughts and actions A perfect example of this is the scary night visits she experienced when in Mongolia For some reason men on horseback would show in the middle of the night at her camps no matter how hard she had tried to stay hidden We are told about these strange and frightening occurrences but only in the vaguest terms Not what the men said or did or how she reacted to them When did they go away What did they want She doesnt tell us Which Im afraid is a cheat and not the way to go about writing this sort of thing up imho If theres something you dont want to address then for heavens sake dont bring it up Its not like well know the differenceWhich brings my third and final point to the fore Theres some jumpiness in the telling Im used to reading the diaries of settlers so Im comfortable with jumps in time in that format But as I said this isnt a diary so the jumps are a little strange and unwelcome And perhaps this ties into some of the continuity problems One example is where she tells us her personal philosophy is to never stay in one spot for more than one night unless it is an absolute emergency Then a couple of pages later she stops for  days and has a nice rest with a tour guide She then tells us that she plans to ask him why the Mongolians are behaving in such an unexplained fashion  women taking off their tops when in her presence and the men appearing in the middle of the night She and the tour guide have a good laugh over these questions but we arent let in on the answers WHAT DO I REALLY THINK  I think this book has features of interest but that its going to frustrate quite a few reviewers One should definitely read a sample chapter before purchasing   I really enjoyed Sarah Marquiss Wild by Nature One Woman One Trek One Thousand Nights I would love to go on an adventure like this Unfortunately I am too neurotic for such a trip I dont know how I would have reacted in many of the situations the author found herself in such as when the horsemen kept visitingstalking her encampment at night The author kept her composure much better than I would have Ms Marquis also crossed several arid regions and thats a big nono for me Heat and I do not get along well one of the reasons I live in North Dakota She certainly has staminaI enjoyed the travel diary layout of the book as well as the illustrated maps that show the path of her trek There is also a lot of useful advice in this book for those who may venture out onto an overseas adventure such as some of the tips for finding water as well as the Chinese sign language numbers About the only beef I have with the book is that for the first few chapters about one out of every ten pages did not print correctly and there is a vertical line down the middle of the pages where the text did not print Most of the words are easy to figure out but others are not Other than that the book is an easy quick read and I would recommend it to people who enjoy travel adventures and memoirs I obtained my copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway and I appreciate the opportunity to read and review it   I think any review of this book needs to start with acknowledging and celebrating that Sarah Marquis is an absolutely phenomenal woman a force of nature herself She has an iron will and no fear Situations that would be difficult under normal circumstancessuch as having an abscessed tooth or dengue feverand lay your average white collar worker out for a week she handles while camping in the jungle alone The second she recovers shes up walking again She seeks out the harshest environments possiblethe Gobi desert Southeast Asian jungle the Australian outbackwith aplomb Lets be clear she hiked from Mongolia to the bottom edge of Australia It took  years Even the last leg of her journey  kilometers through Southern Australia a short distance relative to her entire trip seems impossibly long to someone like me who gets winded and tired after hiking for just  or  miles Her story is absolutely wild So really my lack of enthusiasm for this book has nothing to do with Marquis herself She seems a little quirky opinionated and even a bit arrogant especially when she talks about the people of Mongolia China and Australia that she encounters However she has a right to be arrogant Shes accomplished so much She has a right to her quirks such as her staunch vegetarianism on ethical groundsif anyone proves by example that you can be healthy as a vegetarian she can I say more power to her As for her judgments of the people she encounters at some points I did feel it was a little unjustified If youre a stranger traveling through a strange land its important to be respectful and open to different customs and traditions than what youre used to On the other hand I do not feel that she is racist or prejudiced in any way Some of the people she talks smack about actually suck as people For instance an old lady sabotaged her campsite out of what seemed like simple spite many of the men she encountered seemed ready to rape her or assault her for absolutely no reason she had to deal with theft and no one trusting her and customs officials and shady characters always seemed ready to hold her up or deny her entry into their turf for no reason It sounded pretty rough and its sad that some people are so xenophobic they cant deal with a woman traveling on foot alone through their country I understand when people feel annoyed with tourists who are loud in the way destructive disrespectful etc but Sarah Marquis was none of those things at all times it seemed like all she wanted was to avoid people and leave as little impact as possible environmental or otherwise So I understand the frustration she expresses No my issue with this book is the writing I heard a great interview with Sarah Marquis on NPRs On Point with Tom Ashbrook and honestly I would suggest listening to that or reading one of the many interviews with her or writings about her travels she was sponsored by National Geographic Im sure they have lots of fascinating material about her trips instead of reading this book Maybe its the translation maybe its the fact that its ghostwritten Im not entirely sure It reads more like an outline than a finished book For the uniqueness of the subject matter I was surprised by how boring I found it Certain instances that seem like they could have been a short essay in and of themselves were summed up in scant sentences Even though you understand that Sarah Marquis has a strong deeply emotional connection to nature walking and this trip it doesnt come through in the writing I have to compare it to other walking books that I really enjoyBill Brysons A Walk in the Woods and Cheryl Strayeds Wild Even though both authors walked far shorter distances than Marquis Bill Bryson didnt even walk the entire Appalachian Trail before writing his book both of those books carry more emotional weight interest insight and just overall better storytelling than Wild by Nature Brysons book had more humor and a better flow He supplied a lot of history of the trail but made it very interesting He sketched out some of the travelers he encountered in hilarious detail whereas Marquis might just sum up an encounter with a stranger in a few words and move on leaving you wondering what just happened or why the person was mentioned at all As for Cheryl Strayeds book some might say that it verges too much into sentimental emotional material It deals heavily with her loss of her mother to cancer which topically seems unrelated to hiking But for me she really made it work mirroring her journey through grief to her physical journey across the Pacific Crest Trail She also delved into her own faults and past mistakes in great detail She described the trail with a great sense of wonder and at times her story got very tense Once again better storytelling than in Wild by Nature made Strayeds book for me much more gripping At the end of Wild and A Walk in the Woods I felt that I had been on a journey with the authors that I knew something personal about what these trips meant to them With Wild by Nature I felt as though the physical steps of the journey had been described to me stopping to camp recovering from illnesses encountering potentially dangerous people and wildlife etc but a story had not been told There was not enough detail to feel entrenched in the trip in what it must have been like to travel through such perilous territory alone So in the end even though Sarah Marquis may be the most adventurous brave traveler with the most to show for her efforts Wild by Nature didnt reflect that   ARC provided by Allen  Unwin A new adventure has been chronicled for all readers who find enjoyment in seeing the world through a wandering explorers eyesSarah Marquis spent three years from  traversing through incredibly harsh environmental conditions from the despairing heat of the Mongolian Gobi Desert to Siberia Thailand and the great Australian outbackShe was recently applauded for her global treks by being named National Geographic Explorer of the Year in  and has a number of published books behind her but most of them nonEnglishWild by Nature unlike other adventuresome memoirs is not retold in the form of a personal journal instead it is written much like a novel and although Marquis shares her life experiences of stamina and adaptability the book read slightly jagged with its short and sharp sentence structure and felt slightly disconnected with references to other expeditions over the course of her lifetimeIt almost felt like her adventure didnt translate well onto the pageChapters went from one expedition to the next and it was difficult at times to grasp where on the spectrum the reader was until a few paragraphs inBut Marquis has more than  years of experience and although much of her preparation isnt delved into readers will however appreciate the fact she was a woman alone in the middle of nowhere and conquering her surroundingsTo learn of Marquis and her love of walking through unknown territory is real to learn of what she came across is real and that is what readers will enjoy the most Her passion is astounding and to know she has conquered such an amazing feat is astoundingFor those readers not interested in sentence structure timeline or what it takes to prepare for such an adventure this is a wonderful read You can certainly get lost and absorbed into Marquis world and feel motivated to start your own expedition   "},
{"title": "The Children of Hrin",
"isbn": "0007246226",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "It is a legendary time long before The Lord of the Rings and Morgoth the first Dark Lord dwells in the vast fortress of Angband in the North and within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the war waged by Morgoth against the Elves the fates of Trin and his sister Ninor will be tragically entwinedTheir brief and passionate lives are dominated by the elemental hatred that Morgoth bears them as the children of Hrin the man who dared to defy him to his face Against them Morgoth sends his most formidable servant Glaurung a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire in an attempt to fulfil the curse of Morgoth and destroy the children of HrinBegun by JRR Tolkien at the end of the First World War The Children of Hrin became the dominant story in his later work on Middleearth But he could not bring it to a final and finished form In this book Christopher Tolkien has constructed after long study of the manuscripts a coherent narrative without any editorial invention It has been said that all good things must come to an end In this case the end of Children of Hurin also marks the end of my quest to read a book by each of my five favorite authors It seems like a fitting way to end this journey in that Tolkien is the oldest of my favorites and if there was ever a modern author suited to endofquest tales it was Tolkien He was also the author on my list that gave me the greatest concernnot only has he passed away but his body of published work is relatively small I didnt want to reread the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings not because I dont love them but because I wanted to be able to read something new just as I had with the other authors Having read the Silmarillion several months earlier I was hard pressed to think of what else to read Sure I could have gone for Letters From Father Christmas or Farmer Giles of Ham but neither of those somehow felt right Tolkiens tales of MiddleEarth were what cemented him as one of my favorite writers and I wanted to go back to MiddleEarth as part of this projectFortunately the publishing gods smiled upon me and gave me Children of Hurin This is another in a line of books composed by Tolkiens estate taken from various notes fragments and other unfinished writings and molded into a coherent whole In that respect for the record its very well done The text flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter and I never once had the sense that I was reading something out of place or inauthentic This feels like Tolkiens writing and if it isnt exactly what he intended I have to believe its pretty damn closeBut what of the story itselfThe story of Hurin and his offspring is told as part of the Silmarillion but not in the detail that Tolkien intended Tolkien believed that this story was one that could be told apart from the Silmarillion as a wholethat it was strong enough and vibrant enough to stand on its own And he is absolutely correctChildren of Hurin is an epic Its also a tragedy If you come into this book expecting glorious battles and happy endings you will be sorely disappointed though if you come to Tolkien expecting nothing but happiness and light I submit you havent read Tolkien very often or carefully This is not a tale of good triumphing over evil but a tale of a family brought down by an epic curse More Macbeth than Star Wars in other wordsThe writing itself is epicChildren of Hurin reads a lot like Beowulf or the Iliad Tolkien apparently originally tried to write the tale as an actual epic poem but was never quite able to make it work Still his prose captures that same spirit rhythm and cadence As a huge fan of epic and epic poem I love itDespite the epic prose and tragic scope the characters of Children of Hurin are very well crafted and ultimately very human Their actions while not always rational are often understandable and while the tragedy has its origins in the supernatural it is Morgoth who curses the line of Hurin there is not a strong sense that the plot is forced simply by supernatural means Instead we get the sense that these are perhaps well meaning but ultimately deeply flawed people who suffer for their choices and the choices of others The final scene of the book when Hurin is finally reunited with his dying wife is absolutely heartbreakingTheres also a wonderful scene much earlier which really stuck with me and I need to mention it here just because its so wonderfully crafted It occurs shortly after Hurins capture by Morgoth when Morwen his wife is trying to figure out what to do with herself and her children Turin the son says something to the effect of I know my father is dead He must be because I know that his love for us is so strong that if he were alive no chains could hold him and no amount of enemies could keep him from returning to usAnd Morwens answer is I do not think either of those things is true my sonIts a wonderful if completely heartbreaking moment where a childlike view of heroism clashes completely with the harsh realities of the world It strikes me as a very Tolkienesque moment in many ways much of Tolkiens work deals with the interplay between heroics and the personal cost or realities of those heroics At least thats my initial thought In any case its an immensely powerful sceneThe text of the book is aided by the wonderful illustrations done by Alan Lee who has done a lot of Tolkienrelated art in the past His illustrations are interspersed in no particular order throughout the book but each one of them is gorgeous and really adds to the flavor of the text It would have been neat to see some more of themThis is yet another Tolkien book Ill be rereading in the future Its a fine addition to the Middle Earth canon   As a general rule I try to write my reviews in a vacuum as much as possible that is before I read through the other reviews already here I am not going to be able to do that here I have spent more than twenty years with this story since my mother first read the Unfinished Tales version aloud to me when I was eight years old and if Christopher Tolkien had not put this volume together I might have eventually had the hubris to do so myself Let me start by making a couple of points First this is not a new book in any sense of the word other than it is now standing on its own between two covers and without visible editorial apparatus for the first time Second Christopher Tolkien cannot be said to have written any portion of the narrative of this book despite many reviewers intimations to the contrary The bulk of this text appeared in Unfinished Tales with significant gaps Tolkien the son has filled in these gaps using the relevant sections from the much more concise version that was used in assembling The Silmarillion as well as framing material at the beginning and end of the current volume also from The Silmarillion Christopher Tolkien has done little more here than the literary equivalent of very carefully stitching a few patches to mend the gaping holes in an otherwise noble and beautiful garmentOn to the story itself then This is as so many others have already noted with varying degrees of enthusiasm a very dark tale If you dont like very dark tales well then you will quite likely not like this It is also in a prose style as is the vast bulk of Tolkiens work that is very susceptible to being called stilted because compared to contemporary prose it is But as at least one reviewer here has wisely noted the tone is in keeping with the tone of the Nordic sagas of which Tolkien was so fond of and inspired by And like so many ancient sagas and myths this tale is about an entire family haunted by a doom they cannot escapeOr is it I think that Tolkien has done a wonderful job here of subverting the curse of Morgoth and the doom of Hrin and his kin with another motif free will Tolkien who strenuously avoids almost any hint of allegory throughout his vast imaginative work nevertheless imbued almost every corner of that world with reflections of his own deeplyheld Catholic convictions and sensibilities The core of the story is the tension between doomfate on the one hand and free will on the other Trin makes decision after decision that invariably lead to tragic consequences But does he do so because he is doomed to do so Or because he is a man of haughty pride who stubbornly refuses to consider any viewpoint but his own using his considerable gifts natural charisma and rightfullylegendary physicalmartial prowess to charge willfully forward regardless of even foreseeable consequences to anyone and everyone around him I believe that it is very much the latter but without necessarily completely repudiating the former The malice of such a being as Morgoth is a very real force in the tale of the Silmarils and such malevolence bent upon a single family and largely upon a single individual as Trin rises to prominence can be understood to have tangible effect on individuals and events And even on a more mundane level the incursions and aggressive actions of Morgoths forces both the marauding armies of Orcs and the Easterlings who occupy Trins childhood homeland can be understood to push Trin in a particular direction in his life that he might not have gone had circumstances in his life and in his world been otherwise So there is some range to the senses in which Morgoth can be said to have cursed the children of HrinBut Trin has also grown up the proud child of a proud mother effectively orphaned from the age of nine he receives ostensibly every advantage yet the pride instilled in him from the earliest age tragically unravels every opportunity he is presented with from his youthful fostering in the halls of Thingol onwards It is his human choices not the supernatural force of an evil will that guide him on his tragic path and this complex narrative thread is what makes this to my mind one of the greatest of all of Tolkiens tales    Instead of The Children or Hrin this book should be entitled The story in which view spoilerEverybody Dies  by JRR Tolkien Oh My God And here I thought only Shakespeare wrote good Renaissance tragedies Really This story is so tragically sad I forget it was written by TolkienI wont write a summary for the story but Ill write down some things about it that might persuade you to read this amazing book Elves and more Elves If you like wise brave elves who like to fight a lot and are good with a sword and a bow read this  Dragons Evil firebreathing monsters that destroy everything in their path kill half of the characters and torture the main charactercheck Revenge Always a good reason to ruin your life Stubborn flawed cursed main anti hero Who suffers a lot MiddleEarth A nice little walk across the Middle Earth west of the Blue Mountains Its Tolkien ok Do you need more reasonsOk ok Here maybe these nice pictures convince you to read thissourcesourcebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   The Children of Hurin is not a for people who saw the Lord of the Rings movies and then read the book Its for hardcore fans The people who remember all the names from the The Silmarillion Or for the few people out there who reread Beowulf a lot The Children of Hurin reads like a Nordic SagaAs a self proclaimed Tolkien Fanatic I enjoyed The Children or Hurin The Heroic epic and ultimately tragic life of Turin and his sisters Its not more The Lord of the Rings but it continues to paint a more vivid tapestry for the Fellowships stories to play out againstThere are a number or jarring transitions in the book Evidence of the unfinished state Tolkien left the tale in But this actually gives a more authentic feeling to the story Like a recovered Saga or Epic that is missing a few passages Hurin is high fantasy and if it were not set in the world of Tolkiens other stories it would be as unaccessible as the Kalevala Even with its grounding in the world of hobbits it is a book for the few not the many   The Children of Hurin provides some great historical material to Tolkiens world of MiddleEarth and adds even more richness to the Lord of the Rings This addition to Tolkiens extensive historical background of Middleearth fills in the gaps and fleshes out stories that have been mentioned and hinted at in other works by giving us a detailed and colorful look at the tragic story surrounding Trin and Ninor Hurins children and the ongoing battle against Morgoth the master of the Lord of the Rings evil character SauronThis is a welltold tale with engaging characters and plenty of action that keeps the reader interested throughout While not as enthralling as the Lord of the RIngs Trilogy or as entertaining and wonderful as The Hobbit The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to the MiddleEarth cannon and is a more complete novel than most other source material that is out there It stands on its own well and one does not need to have read any of the other histories to follow along with what is going on hereOverall a solid work that Id recommend to fans of Tolkiens works or epic fantasy in general   "},

"author": "Primo Levi",
"text": "In  Primo Levi a twentyfiveyearold chemist and Italian citizen of Jewish race was arrested by Italian fascists and deported from his native Turin to Auschwitz Survival in Auschwitz is Levis classic account of his ten months in the German death camp a harrowing story of systematic cruelty and miraculous endurance Remarkable for its simplicity restraint compassion and even wit Survival in Auschwitz remains a lasting testament to the indestructibility of the human spirit Levi ensinoume que as histrias do Holocausto terminam sempre com perguntas E sim  brbaro escrever Poesia depois de Auschwitz mas vejam  possvel Costumo pegar neste excerto e dizer ao mundo o quanto gostava de ter sido eu a escrevloE veio a noite e foi uma noite tal que se sabe que olhos humanos no deveriam assistir e sobreviver Todos sentiram isso nenhum dos guardas quer italianos quer alemes teve a coragem de vir ver que coisas fazem os homens quando sabem que vo morrer Cada um se despediu da vida da maneira que melhor sabia Alguns rezaram outros beberam alm da conta outros inebriaramse numa nefasta e ltima paixo Mas as mes mantiveramse acordadas e prepararam com cuidado amoroso o alimento para a

travesseiros e centenas de outras pequenas coisas das quais as crianas sempre necessitam No fariam tambm vocs a mesma coisa Se fossem morrer amanh com os vossos filhos no lhes dariam hoje de comer    This book is said to be one of the most important books ever written about Holocaust What I am referring here are not the history books but the firsthand experiences written and narrated by the people who were there when the Holocaust happened Since I read a handful of these I cant disagree I even think that in some aspects this could be the MOST important of them allYou see Anne Frank wrote her diary    at  while hiding in her house with her family so she was not able to include her harrowing experience in the concentration camp where she died The writing was innocent poignant and endearing but did not contain much Victor Klemperer wrote his volume diary    but a good bulk of it was his experience trying to elude the authorities as he had an Aryan wife so although he was asked to live in a ghetto he did not experience being in a concentration camp Imre Kertesz wrote his quasiautobiographical novel    telling the concentration camp experience of a yo boy Gyorgy George in Auschwitz but he disavowed the strong biographical connection of the book to his life even if he was  when he was sent with his family to the camp Last year I was tearyeyed when I finished reading Elie Wiesels    since it was too emotional and the writing was haunting However Elie Wiesel was  during the Holocaust so he wrote from the perspective of a teenager What I mean is that given that the tragedy was all sad and harrowing we already knew the perspective of a child or a teenager from Anne Frank Kertesz and Wiesel so I thought I also would like to have the perspective of a grownup survivor This now is what Victor Frankl in his clinical book    and Primo Levi in this book    provideIn their books Victor Frankl and Primo Levi recounted WHAT THEY DID TO SURVIVE I thought that this could have only been possible to come from thinking adults who are expected to be less emotional and more rational than most teenagersVictor Frankl says that to survive one has to hold on to the image of yourself stepping out of the camp and going back to your life prior to the concentration camp Everyday you think of yourself going back to your home job loved ones hobby etc These happy images are so powerful they will give you reason to hope and livePrimo Levi is more comprehensive and tothepoint He says three  organization  pity and  theft Levi survived using  as he was a summa cum laude chemistry graduate from Turin so he got lucky to be asked to work in the laboratory making synthetic rubber inside Auschwitz But in this book he gave examples of the prisoners who thrived using the other two or combinations or all the threeThats the reason why I said that this could indeed be the MOST important book written about the Holocaust If it happens again God forbid you have the tips on how to survive Those tips come from first hand experiences of people who experienced them I mean well it is nice to cry and be sad after reading a book but it better to have something like a survival handbook too   Its hard to say anything about this magnificent book that hasnt been said many times before so I wont even try but just write a note on why I have an abiding sadness when I think of the authorPrimo Levi lived all his life in the house of his birth in Turin Italy apart from when he was in the concentration camp Luckily he lived just through that awful murderous year and to all intents and purposes resumed the life of a chemist and author that the Nazis interrupted He wrote The Periodic Table  lauded as the best science book ever written Later he died from a fall down a narrow stairwell It has been argued this wasnt suicide but who climbs over banisters and falls down narrow stairwells except on purpose As Elie Wiesel said Primo Levi died at Auschwitz forty years earlier Alav HaShalom Rest in Peace dear soulFinished July      I will try not to overstate my feelings on this book I believe this is one of if not THE most important book ever written Everyone should read this book It details Levis journey from his home in Turin to Buchenwald It is absolutely beautifully written Levis style of writing is unlike any other Ive read It is detailed incredibly intelligent moving poignant and in some way almost detached from his experience which makes reading about it all the more moving and painful To hear him describe the horrors he saw and went through in such a thirdperson sort of way is truly heartbreaking All of his works are amazing but this is the one that I recommend to all of my friends Ive bought several people copies of this book because I feel it is that important We must never forget what happened And we must never allow it to happen again     Primo Levi was an Italian Jew who came to live in very troubled times Born and raised in Turin he was subjected to the fascist racial laws which discriminated against Jews and made finding employment very difficult after the German occupation of Italy began he joined the resistance movement but was quickly caught and transferred to an internment camp When the camp itself came under German control the authorities started arranging mass deportations of captured Jews to labor and death camps in the occupied east Travelling in a cattle truck through cold and misery Levi arrived at Auschwitz in February  He was  years old and would be one of the twenty Jews who remained alive from his transport of  people when the Red Army liberates the camp in January Survival in Auschwitz is the record of Levis time at the camp in his own words Its worth noting that this is the title specifically picked for the American release I much prefer the original Italian and English translation    which conveys the tone and theme of the book much much better Survival in Auschwitz sounds almost like asurvival manual a set of precepts that one should follow if one finds him or herself at such a place If This Is a Man is taken from a poem by Levi which opens the book and in which he asks his readers  sitting contendly in their warm safe heated houses to remember and think about what happened never forget about it and pass this knowledge on to future generationsConsider if this is a manLevis memoir is a chronicle of life inside a concentration camp a world within a world news from the outside world perpetrate the barbed wire very rarely and only at the end of the book in the form of sound of distant artillery which signify the slowly advancing Russians and the growing panic among camp officials Despite growing increasingly more deformed squalid and haggard and their numbers thinning with every day the camp had a cleaer hierarchical structure which had to be followed and where there was no official hierarchy a nonofficial one was quickly invented When we think about concentration camps we mostly remember their last and most gruesome part the gas chambers and the crematorium As important as they are they are just a part of a larger whole  we often forget that people not only died in these camps but also lived Levis memoir is a chronicle of life inside a concentration camp which in his own word is equal to reaching the bottom with no other condition possibly being more miserable a total demolition of what makes a man the removal of ones personal dignity and reducing people to a sequence of numbers taking away all that they own even their hair being forced to exist in conditions which make existence impossible and reduced to purely biological beings who struggle only to remain alive Despite all this incredibly living is possible even in a place where it couldnt be and because of the smallest things even a nonwindy day can make a world of difference for a prisoner and give him the impression of good fortune because a windy and rainy day is so much worse than ordinary rain Prisoners steal from each other as is the custom but also interact and barter with one another and sometimes even form what in another world would be a friendshipThe experience of reading this book is very intense as Levi does not make excuses for either himself or his fellow prisoners and their behavior he is not sentimental and selfpitying and hides nothing The memoir was first published in  just

{"title": "Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman",
"isbn": "0679747044",
"author": "James Gleick",
"text": "Genius is a brilliant interweaving of Richard Feynmans colourful life and a detailed and accessible account of his theories and experiments  nearly half a century of which amount to no less than the story of modern physics itself The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool Richard FeynmanPhysics is like sex sure it may give some practical results but thats not why we do it Richard FeynmanFeynman was lucky in three ways First the guy was born with a brain that somehow gave him access to problems with a speed and a dexterity that seemed magical to his peers and his peers are people that already often stretched the capacity for knowledge and intelligence Second Feynman was lucky to be born at the right time He came into his abilities at the right moment for Physics He was there when physicists post Einsteins relativity seemed to grab a larger piece of global attention Third Feynman was lucky to have participated in WWIIs war of the magicians Los Alamos and the Atomic Bomb All of these things combined with Feynmans iconoclastic nature his perseverance and singlemindedness his capacity to get to the root of problems put Feynman second to Einstein in th century mindsThe book itself is a very good example of scientific biography Gleick doesnt stray however too far from the anecdotal autobiography of Feynman in Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character Gleick elaborates provides more detail adds interesting vignettes on other Physicists that fell into Feynmans orbit Wilson Oppenheimer Dyson Dirac Bohr Schwinger GellMann etc Those diversions and Gleicks occasional riffs on the idea of genius keep this from being just an average scientific biography It also was a bit stronger and more robust than Gleicks earlier work Chaos Making a New Science All that said it still wasnt an AMAZING biography I appreciated the time spent on the details The accuracy and notes associated with this book but a lot of the magic of the book existed in Feynman himself and not in the telling of it    I recently finished reading Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick Im a big fan of Gleicks His book on Isaac Newton was brilliant And in this bio of Feynman who was one of the midwives of the atomic bomb Gleick illustrates just how important Feynmans thinking has been to our modern understanding of physics and therefore of energy Feynman grappled with the big questions about matter science and the quest for human knowledge and understanding One of my favorite parts of Gleicks book comes early on when he talks about Feynmans effort to distill human understanding of science into as short a passage as possible Feynman posed himself this question what if all scientific knowledge were lost in a cataclysm What statement would convey the most knowledge in the fewest words to the next generations Feynman proposed this All things are made of atoms  little particles that move around in perpetual motion attracting each other when they are a little distance apart but repelling upon being squeezed into one anotherIn that one little sentence  you will see there is an enormous amount of information about the world if just a little imagination and thinking are appliedGleick is brilliant For me hes a little like Mark Twain in that when I read his stuff it whispers to me that I should perhaps quit what Im doing because Ill just never be that good   Gleick is a thorough intelligent science writer able to give over complex ideas without sacrificing too much depth He still lost me with some of the particle physics stuff Feynman started his academic career as a precocious math undergrad at Princeton and went to the pinnacle of modern science first at the Manhattan Project and later designing a daunting freshman physics curriculum at CalTech later published as Six Easy Pieces His career neatly parallels the modern perception of science theoretical physics was transformed from a discipline akin in practical application to medieval French to a nearreligion captivating the awed respect of the public and leading to enormous increases in governmental research spending and the development of Big Science And later as the pace of new developments dropped and scientists confronted with an everincreasing list of particles gradually gave up on finding a unified theory of the atom more mystical and antiscientific thinking gradually reemerged Notable personal aspects of Feynman were his prefeminist attitudes toward women culminating in protests at some of his public talks and related his nearconstant womanising He never recovered emotionally from the death of his beloved first wife Also worth noting is that his quips and stories seemingly offthecuff were carefully rehearsed in his notebooksAll of which shouldnt take away from the scope of his genius Gleick sees his subject as the genius par excellence akin to Einstein and Newton the latter a previous biographical subject He devotes a chapter in the final section to a fascinating discussion of the nature and history of genius Feynmans thinking was in speed and clarity unlike that of normal peopleOne final point in an interview with the BBC retold by Gleick Feynman becomes quite agitated when asked to explain in laymans terms how magnets work He insists that they just work This is quite out of the ordinary as in every other regard Feynman seemed to consider the ability to explain something in simple terms as the hallmark of a clear understanding This just adds to my conviction that the Insane Clown Posse was really onto something    This biography puts Feynman in a more balanced neutral light for me When reading his memoirs you only get a glimpse and rather slanted presentation if you are really wanting to learn about Richard FeynmanThis book is really heavy on his scientific endeavors which shouldnt be surprising Despite this the text is very readable and engaging even for those less scientifically inclinedIn my review of Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman I mentioned how much I thought I related to him Well if you met me you probably wouldnt see any resemblance whatsoever most likely Its simply the way he thought about things and his adherence to truth in social encounters and how he was always figuring things out I certainly do not relate to the magician showman or physicist he also was or claim to be anything close to what he is But his stories are very refreshing for me to readThe biography goes into more of his personal life mostly in regards to relationships Reading about him and his wife is touching but I still do not think I fully understand the man in his dealings with womenTalking merely about Feynman is an injustice to this particular book because his colleagues and the science of the time are heavily delved into even more sometimes than about Feynman himself In fact maybe the book is just that a history of the physics at that time and Feynman is the star of the show   I learned about Feynman as a teen when I happened across an interview with him on tv His character and intellect fascinated me and years later I decided to learn more about himGleick covers Feynmans entire life in this biography His prose is good and he maintains a pleasing balance of anecdote and historical fact Feynman had a large vital personality and Gleick is able to convey this without parroting the tone and content that Feynman uses in his autobiographical work Ive always been able to appreciate Feynman based on his own words thanks to Gleick I had the chance to see him from another perspective and appreciate him all the more   "},

"text": "An unknown doomsday virus quickly claims the lives of four people across the country  including Dr Sophia Russell a researcher leading the team trying to crack the disease Devastated and enraged her fiance Lt Colonel Jonathan Smith uncovers evidence that his lovers death was no accident  that someone out there has the virus and the pandemic that threatens countless millions of lives was plannedNot knowing where to turn or whom to trust Smith assembles a private team to aid his fight against the deadly virus While the death toll mounts rapidly their quest leads them to the highest levels of power and the darkest corners of the earth as Smith and his team match wits with a determined genius out to destroy them with the fate of the world in the balance  I have to admit now Robert Ludlum is my guilty pleasureHis books are addictive I dont mind having him as my mostread author His stories give me cheap thrills Cheap in both literal and figurative senses Literal because his books are being sold for about  or  and they flood the secondhand bookshops Figurative because whenever I mention to my literary friends that I love Robert Ludlum I do not get thumbs up unlike when I say that my favorite author is Leo Tolstoy or Alan HollinghurstRobert Ludlum is so commercial that it is almost expected that any thirtyish or fortyish man like me would at some point in his life read all the Ludlum books available in the marketplace Nobody pays attention if a man or even a woman reads or even professes his admiration to his works It is like John Grisham or Dan Brown for the current generation Or maybe my nonliterary readerfriends would still be in awe if they hear somebody reading Dan Brown since its been only a decade ago when the duo bestsellers The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons hit the marketThe Hades Factor started the Covert One series so it was here where Sgt Jon Smith was introduced It was in this book where his girlfriend and fellow scientist Sarah Russell died because of viral epidemic I thought I felt that the event in the book was similar to the SARS that started in Hong Kong in  I thought that maybe Ludlum was inspired by that event Then I noticed that this book was first published in  a year before Ludlum died So Ludlum actually sort of predicted that some kind of disease from monkey would spread throughout the world  years before it actually happenedSo if Aldous Huxley predicted the use of hallucinatory drugs for brainwashing or cloning of babies Robert Ludlum predicted the spread of monkey or fowl virus worldwide Its quite creepy thinking about all these good novelists being able to predict some catastrophic events in the near futureA film shooting of another movie of the Bourne series is being shot here in Manila Thats one reason why I also picked this book I wanted to go to the shooting to watch until I realized that it is Robert Ludlum who I admire and not some kind of crappy secondrate actor Sorry I just miss Matt Damon Why the hell they decided to let go of himI have to complete this series One of the best book series that Ive read   I love Robert Ludlum This book has the oddest set of characters ever in a Robert Ludlum book of international intrigue This is a better spy novel than most spy novels Dr Smith morning the loss of his fiance joins the hunt for her killer and finds out it was no lab accident He has to call in every marker and favor from his past in counter espionage a world he had thought he had left behind to keep himself out of jail and alive long enough to savethe planet From a deadly viral killer Some of the characters were Clive Cusslerishly larger than life but generally Gauyle Lynds and Ludlum manage to keep them under control The story is generally tight and the pace moves from fast to feverishly fast I enjoyed this book and the sequel very much This isnt quite as cerebral as James Rollins if one can call action adventure Cerebral but it is very complex Its a little weak on character development past the main three all men but there is potential to flesh out a couple more in future stories More to it than your average germophobia case   First I should explain that I have read the book twice and seen the movie twice Second I am a big fan of Robert Ludlums work This is one of Ludlums best efforts and I highly recommend eitherboth the book and the movieThe story opens with the start of a plague First a couple of soldiers die then other people Clearly easy to spread this disease and clearly it is deadly No cure Early the story takes on a mideast terrorist theme and we begin to learn the disease is being spread by the terrorists As the team at Covert One a secret US government intelligence agency rampsup we learn that the terrorists have a method of deployment of this airborne virus that will be very effective The story mostly focuses on where did the original virus come from and who is causing it to be spread There are some plot twists slowing down the investigation like murder of some key people While the story seems to be exclusively a bioterrorist plot there is a big plot twist where the terrorists are simply the agent of the people who are really behind the plotA well told story with building suspense Alot of reality in the story which is chilling to imagine this could really happen ie it aint scifi it could happen In the real world we have seen SARS Bird Flu and recently HN Flu effecting the population what if the disease is more deadly than these What if it spread widely Yes this is an exciting suspenseful story This is an exciting race against time to save the world I highly recommend it   Basically a quick read just grabbed it on the way out the door leaving for a trip typical Ludlum but not as good as earlier ones Spoiler Alert where the beautiful lover of protagonist is killed which sets him off on a quest to find those responsible Farfetched plot of virulent virus that is purposely manufactured and spread by evil leader of pharmaceutical company so that he can become even more wealthy by miraculously and very conveniently having millions of doses of the cure available for a previously unknown virusjust a tad suspicious There were some interesting characters like Marty the eccentric computer wizard Peter the Brit and Samson the Doberman guard dog but then I am biased toward Dobermans  A long long time ago I had really enjoyed a few Ludlum novels so I thought it might be time to read another of his books after originally thinking the plots and characters were getting too repetitive so I had to quit reading them Apparently twenty years was not long enough time in between reading his stuff again Maybe Ill try again in another twenty years    Standard covertone novel As usual the plot is good like other novels of the series A deliberately engineered lethal virus is spread to cause a pandemic for financial profits and it kills the fiancee of Smith the protagonist He starts an investigation which leads to capture of the powerful nexus The story is decently paced but at times paused by emotional ramblings My favorite character is Marty the computer geek I could spot some minor flaws in the story line If I got the chronology correct Smith was attacked before Sophia got involved in the case which has not reason Attack on Smith should have been preceded by Sophias involvement Next the murder of Director of NHI who deleted phonelab records and was subsequently run over was never investigated while it should have given important clues Even if the author wanted to highlight it as a humanly mistake of the protagonist it should have mentioned in third person Overall a good book    "},

those who dont understand italics has appeared in Discworlds greatest city Not only does this unwelcome visitor have a nasty habit of charbroiling everything in its path in rather short order it is crowned King it is a noble dragon after all   Meanwhile back at Unseen University an ancient and longforgotten volumeThe Summoning of Dragonsis missing from the Librarys shelves To the rescue come Captain Vimes Constable Carrot and the rest of the Night Watch who along with other brave citizens risk everything including a good roasting to dethrone the flying monarch and restore order to AnkhMorpork before its burned to a crisp A rare tale well done as only Terry Pratchett can Ive been rereading some of the older Pratchett novels Partly because I simply enjoy them Partly because they help keep me sane in an increasingly infuriating world And partly because they are comfortable to me The literary equivalent of a security blanket But Ill be honest Im also reading them so I can postpone reading the final Pratchett novel that came out a little while ago It will be hard for me to read that knowing that afterwards there will be no more new Pratchett to read Ever This is the book that introduces Vimes perhaps my favorite Discworld character And thats saying something given the number of books in the series and the number of truly delightful characters That said on rereading this I was surprised to see where Vimes got his start The Vimes in this first book is a good character but its not the character I grew to love Its pretty obvious that Pratchett was planning on him being a Discworld version of the downonhisluck gumshoe detective Harddrinking and bitter More stubborn than cleverDont get me wrong Vimes is a good character in this book but hes not particularly noteworthy Carrot and the Patrician shine moreAs a writer its interesting for me to see how Pratchett started here with a functional but not stellar character who he then changed rather abruptly into one of my favorites in the whole series Its nice for me to see that Pratchett didnt have it all planned out ahead of time and that he was in fact just making it all up as he went along    How To Read Terry Pratchetts Discworld Novels Skip the first two books in the series This is crucial If you read these first you will be rightly annoyed by their justbarelyokayness and spend the rest of your life muttering about how overrated he is Terry Pratchett wrote these two books Then all of a sudden he started writing really really well I dont know what happened Maybe he sold his soul My own theory is that his longsuffering wife waited as patiently as she could for him to pull himself together as a writer and then after she proofread his second novel something in her snapped and she thwapped him in the head with the book in question Youre better than this damn it she shouted Now get in there and write something good And he did Start with the first book in one of the subseries The Discworld books all take place on the same planet but they involve different groups of peopleThe witches my favoritesThe Night Watch my alsofavoritesDeath granted hes not a group but he does have a familyThe wizardsOkay there are standalones like Small Gods And in a way all the Discworld books are standalones Except for the first two because the first one ends on a cliffhanger Like I said skip them until youve read some of the really good ones and then brace yourself and read them purely for continuity purposes I started with the rd book in the series Carpe Jugulum and was perfectly fine other than a tendency to preach the gospel of Discworld Is Flippin Amazing And You Have To Read These Books which Im trying to get under controlBut its a lot of fun to follow the threads To start for instance with Equal Rites which introduces you to both the witches and the wizards This isnt Hogwarts and those most definitely are not the same thing in Discworld Then you can go on to Wyrd Sisters and Witches Abroad and fall absolutely in love with Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg I fully intend to be Granny Weatherwax when I grow up right down to the goat farm and the ability to terrify people just by saying Good morning Watch this spaceOr you can start with Guards Guards and be introduced to the men of the Night Watch Just bear in mind that Im first in line if Captain Vimes becomes available so keep your inevitable crush on him to yourselfI posted approximately  updates while I reread this book all quotable quotes Thats not even all the bits I wanted to post but Goodreads has a strict wordcount limit on updates because Goodreads hates me knows how I getYou can get a perfectly good sense of whether or not youll enjoy Guards Guards by perusing said updates You will enjoy it if you already enjoy fantasy you will very likely enjoy it even if you dont generally enjoy fantasy because the humor characterization and dialogue are ridiculously goodHave a good time And remember  hands off Vimes Hes mine   What I love most about Pratchetts books is that under a thin layer of funny footnotespeppered punheavy parody lies the core of deep seriousness rooted in the quite sobering understanding of the shallow pettiness of human mundanity fueled by jealousy bile spite and closemindedness  In the end the only thing that makes it possible to wake up in the morning is just a slight deviation from this depressing state of affairs that leads to the understanding and a bit of dignity and doing whats right  even when thats not quite expected Because someone has to uphold whats right Because someone needs to swim against the current   This is one of my favorite Discworld books and one of the best starting points for the Discworld newbies It is the first book in the subcycle focusing on the City Watch of Ankh Morpork the Pearl of Cities on the Disc the book that really takes a look into the inner workings of this crowded dirty and despicable and yet lovably tenacious urban metropolis In Pratchetts tradition of deconstructing the tropes this one has its kings and tyrants and secret societies and dragons and maidens and heroes and heirs with birthmarks and magical swords as well as milliontoone chances  except that things tend to not work out as planned And all of it is woven into a neat tight plot that carries us through the dry humor and slapstick and sad seriousness to the unexpected depth as you allow the cogs and wheels of your brain turn contemplating Pratchetts intentions  I am a Sam Vimes girl through and through And this book is our introduction to our cynical antihero uncompromising grumpy and terrifyingly soberknurd knurd as in complete and utter opposite to drunk beyond simple sobriety AnkhMorpork copper with the unsettling tendency to ask uncomfortable questions when others would much rather he didnt This is the beginning of the Vimes we all know and love the evolution from the downinthegutter pessimistic drunk brung low by a woman the city itself that is to the equally pessimistic servant not of the King or the Patrician but the law a thorn in the side of so many notsouncorrupt but quite respectably upstanding Ankh citizens Reduced to almostnothingness by the corruption in the city spending his time in the gutter literally laughed at by everyone except his two colleagues  the thick but amiable Fred Colon and a disgrace to human race aka Nobby Nobbs  Vimes gets a bit of a wakeup call when the Watch gets its newest recruit Lance Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson a nottoobright but earnest  foot  inches dwarf hes adopted okay armed with a Book of Laws and Ordinances of AnkhMorpork and a decidedly nonmagical swordAnd when the city is facing danger Vimes bit by bit begins to think about it as HIS city After all    And once Vimes sets his singleminded nature to accomplish something occasionally aided by the Librarian who is a peanutloving orangutan and the imposing figure of Lady Sybil Ramkin who breeds swamp dragons in her spare time there is little that can stop him The threat to AnkhMorpork is real and quite substantial view spoiler but ultimately its brought along and fueled by the simple human greed shallowmindedness and jealousy little pathetic mundanity of human existence that Pratchett so nonchalantly and nonpreachily lets showcase itself He it seems has an excellent ability of seeing the lessthanpleasant things that make people tick  and still manages to make these sad realizations both sidesplittingly and laughthroughtears funny And I adore that  Another prominent figure in this book in addition to Vimes and Carrot is of course Lord Havelock Vetinari the enigmatic Patrician the tyrant who is not quite well tyrannical the man with his finger on the pulse of the city the man who would not build a dungeon out of which he could not escape the man resembling a predatory flamingo who makes Ankh Morpork work and in cynicism can greatly rival Vimes himself This is the beginning of the fascinating and not always so voluntary cooperation between Vimes and the one in power and its lovely to read about  And of course some place of prominence is given to the Librarian the aforementioned orangutan who no pun intended will go bananas if you dare to call him the mword view spoilerMonkey  The Librarian who knows how to navigate the Lspace that parallel dimension that exists between every library in the world created because of terrifying power of books  I highly recommend this book to anyone as a perfect starting point on their Discworld journey It is a perfect introduction to the world of intelligent humor peppered with allusions to almost everything you can think of and smart conclusions that make you think and even ask the uncomfortable questions of yourself and the society It is a lovely way to spend several hours curled up in a chair on a rainy day mesmerized by Pratchetts wit and wisdom The audiobook version of it is wonderful immersing you in the atmosphere of the story incredibly well For all of it I give it  stars  and without much further ado embark on the rest on my Ankh Morpork City Watch reread  brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   At the time of writing Terry Pratchett passed away about a week ago Beside making me sad the news also triggered a sudden urge to read a Discworld book which needed to be satisfied immediately I havent read any Terry Pratchett books for years I have always liked them but there are just so many books in the world and you know how it is one thing led to another and somehow they didnt lead back to Sir Terry In the meantime I have been reading many inferior flavor of the month books like The Martian I have been doing myself a disservice reallyGuards Guards is one of the most popular Discworld books and I have not read it this makes it the ideal candidate for a reentry into this unique and wonderful series Anyway it is nice to be back in AnkhMorpork the most chaotic city in fantasy fiction At the most basic level Guards Guards is Pratchetts take on the police procedural but his imagination is too immense to constrain the book to just a single genre parody so there is much more to this book than just the City Watch AnkhMorporks feeble excuse for a police force The Watch mean are happily doing a crappy job which basically involve ringing bells at certain times of the night to announce that all is well in the city It takes the arrival of an extremely honest and straightlaced human orphan raised by dwarves to remind the Watchmen what they are supposed to be and a huge dragon summoned from another dimension burning up the citizens and half the city to spur them into actionOne reason I only read Terry Pratchett occasionally is that I personally prefer books where humour is a minor element of the story rather than placed at the front and centre After reading Guards Guards I have to admit this is my misconception of what Pratchett was doing with the Discworld series after the first few straightforward fantasy parody books The humour takes centre stage but underneath  not even far underneath  Pratchett was using Discworld as a mirror to explore lampoon and critique our world with its many ills and injustice Certainly Guards Guards explores the theme of the policemens duty and honor against personal safety and interest what makes a good cop and a bad cop so to speak He also skewers the masses tendency to blindly accept whoever has the biggest gun or fire breathing talent These and other serious issues are explored without ever missing a humorous beat The book is a laugh fest from beginning to end I dont think there is a single page that did not make me at least chuckleI actually laughed out loud several times my favorite joke involves the phrase Bjorn Stronginthearm is my uncle which highlights the bizarreness of the British phrase Bobs your uncle Also the patricians questioning of dragons penchant for sleeping on a huge pile of gold instead of a comfy mattress is brilliant Dont worry I have not spoiled the book for you I am barely scratching the surface of the many ingenious satires jokes and witticisms to be found in this bookThe characterization of the protagonists and antagonists is also very strong Captain Vimes is silly and funny yet flawed sympathetic honorable and extremely likable I am not surprised he one of Pratchetts most beloved characters The formidable Patrician Vetinari is another extremely vivid and lively creation in a TV adaptation of another Discworld book he is perfectly portrayed by Charles Dance so you can imagine the dry wit and suavity of the man His method of escaping from captivity in a dungeon is pure evil geniusGuards Guards is effortlessly a fivestar book and if I may leave you with a quote from this book that works perfectly even out of contextThe reason that clichs become clichs is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communicationThe irony is that there is not one clich in this book unless you count the ones that Pratchett turned on their headsRIP Sir Terry you were the bestCredit celticwren   First of all my site has the videos that go with this httpsclsiewertwordpresscomBut heres the lite versionMy Terry Pratchett Experience  is remarkably similar to my Month Python Experience Fun and funny but really best done in small doses Say  minute doses if Im watching longer if Im reading It turns out I havent read GuardsGuards before although I thought I had Quite possibly it is because I had not Quite possibly its because I had and forgot but youd think Id remember the dragons For future reference its the one where the adopted dwarf Carrot goes to the big city of AnkhMorpork and joins the Night Watch in hopes of Becoming a Man Night Watch captain Sam Vines spends most of his days and nights in an alcoholic stupor but the antics of Carrot in Enforcing Law and Order soon force Vines into involvement Meanwhile a secret society the Elucidated Bethren of the Ebon Night has decided to summon a dragon intending on overthrowing the Patrician Lord Vetinari and replacing him with an oldfashioned monarchy Some of the Brothers are quite sure they are being held down and need a monarchy to make things rightLike Monty Python Pratchett specializes in absurdity in mocking our perceptions definitions and expectation Clever and funny a little bit of social commentary with an edge both are particularly skilled in word gamesWhich puts me in mind of another famous sketch based on you know meaning and suchI wish to complain about this parrot I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutiqueWhats wrong with itIts deadNo no its restingIt is funny but when its all clever wordplaymocking villains in their thick dark cowls and the general populace for being sheep and Carrot for being So Earnest and Lady Sybil for being such a hearty large Englishwoman and the only one who is really clever is the Patricianwell its a bit hard to empathize And honestly rather tiringThen theres the Librarian an orangutan who runs the greatest library in the world Hes trying to make Constable Carrot understand a serious crime has been committedWhich pretty much reminds me of the Albatross sketch Both use the device of the straight man for maximum sillinessThe Albatross at IntermissionAt the end of the day certainly fun Theres certainly messages and social commentary that elevate it above simple romps but it tends to be applied with heavy emphasis Like Python best enjoyed in short sketches Dont worry Ill show myself outOn the way to the Ministry of Silly Walks   "},

"text": "This collection includes two of Tolkiens best fairy stories The world of Faery is the setting for Smith of Wootton Major The preparation of Great Cake to mark the Feast of Good Children was a human cheerful occasion but other less material powers were at work and the world of man and of Faery met and blended in a strange haunting unionLeaf by Niggle is an apt and beautiful illustration of Tolkiens theory that fairy stories about the Faery have either own literary value and should not be seen either as academic exercises or as stories written specifically for children A visit to Faery Beware It may touch your soulUnlike Lord of the Rings which Tolkien labored over for decades Smith came to him in a flash and he dashed it off whole It has a rough quality which betrays both that inspiration and that lack of refining Nonetheless it should entertain and enrich any reader who appreciate Farmer Giles of Ham or Leaf by Niggle An excellent companion for On Fairy Stories from The Tolkien Reader since Smith of Wootton Major is just such a fairy storyBTW it is only on the second or third reading that the wonder grew upon me The first time through I read it like any storyand of that it was quick and crude Subsequent readings the Faery grows upon youAfter fifth reading it still grabs me as usually only real fairy tales do Most modern fantasy seems so contrived Tolkien had a grasp for what really works   Smith of Wootton Major is a fairytale by Tolkiens own definition The fairies are not small and precious but real and potentially dangerous and so is their land Its a rather quiet story I think  there are no great dangers no dragons to be fought or Dark Lords to be overthrown though you might see echoes of that story here The precious star was in earlier drafts a ring after allIn any case its a thoughtful little story I almost said sweet but I think that would be reducing it to something like the decoration on the cake which insults the fairy queenThis extended edition casts light on Tolkiens thought process during all stages of his creative process with it It includes much of the backstory and explanations which support the story which he had to know whether the readers did or not It also contains some early drafts both reproduced and transcribed Its interesting particularly if youre interested in Tolkiens creative process   Il fabbro di Wootton Major  un racconto di JRR Tolkien pubblicato nel  lultima opera mentre lautore era ancora in vita Romanticamente potremmo considerarla una sorta di commiato dellautore al mondo di Faerie una fiaba per bambini ben ponderata come dimostrano le diverse stesure e gli appunti dellautore a riguardo ed equilibrata piuttosto che uno spontaneo volo dimmaginazione La novella avrebbe dovuto essere

riecheggia il leif motiv di molte opere dellautore soprattutto lattacco dei Racconti ritrovati nel paese di Wootton Major immaginario ma indubbiamente anglosassone ogni ventiquattro anni si tiene una festa a cui partecipano ventiquattro bravi bambini Per loccasione il Maestro Cuoco serve una torta ma in quella preparata da Nokes e dal suo apprendista Alf c una sorpresa una pietra scintillante

nonch protezione per i reami di Faerie che Fabbro esplora in lungo e in largoIl tema principale della fiaba forse pi alla portata degli adulti che dei bambini  quello della rinuncia ampio spazio viene dato oltre naturalmente alle peregrinazioni di Fabbro nelle terre fatate alle modalit di cessione della pietra a un successore perch come raccomanda Alf che forse  molto pi di chi dice di essere al

pubblicata anche suhttpwwwlastambergadeilettoricom    um livro muito legal para quem  f de Tolkien A histria  bem pequena menos da metade de livro O restante do livro  um pouco de contexto sobre a histria e porque ela foi escrita juntamente com algumas ligaes sobre a vida do Tolkien na pocaEsse foi o ltimo livro escrito pelo Tolkien antes de sua morte e diz muito sobre o seus pensamentos sobre escrita sobre o mundo das fadas que no tem nada a ver com o que pensamos dele atualmente e sobre a vida no geralA histria em si lembra um pouco do Mestre Gil de Ham no estilo de escrita   While most of his genius went into the world of MiddleEarth and its fantastical history JRR Tolkien produced a number of smaller stories during his lifeAnd though he disliked allegory the enchanting Smith of Wootton Major is a bit of an oddity among his writings  a beautifully fantastical little fable that drips over with Tolkiens love of real deep fairy tales And unlike many a story of elves or faeries since Tolkien keeps that sense of mystery and magic in the world of the supernaturalIt takes place in a little town not very long ago for those with long memories not very far away fro those with long legs The Master Cook of that village takes a vacation and returns with an apprentice in tow But something odd happens at the Feast of the Cake  the cook stirs in a faystar with little trinkets in the cake and its accidentally swallowed by a boy thereThe boy later called Smith is changed by the faystar which sparkles on his forehead When he grows up Smith ventures into Faery itself and even meets the Faery Queen herself The message she gives him is for her mysterious missing husband the King  who turns out to be the last person anybody in Wootton Major would have expectedSmith is a fairy tale in the best sense Dont expect cackling witches or convenient loopholes in spells here Tolkien was too skilled for that Instead we have majestic fey and sparkling magic woven with a tidy medieval town consider the custom of naming people after their jobs  Smith a smith capisce Never once does it become precious or cutesy only more enchanted as it goes alongIts also among Tolkiens simpler writings especially since it is effectively a short story In fact its so simple that it barely has a plot  the vanishing King is the closest it has to conflict or a complete plotBut Tolkiens writing sparkles with little details of the fey with only a minimum of description His glimpses of Faerieland are too brief but written with the exquisite haunting quality of his betterknown works Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain And he gives the impression of a world of magic far greater than any human could grasp  bearing the white ships that return from battles on the Dark Marches of which men know nothingAnd Smith is an odd sort of hero infused with a kind of otherworldly light and grace that shines from him in the form of Starbrow Perhaps it was so stand in for the ability to see the magical and fantastical in the mundane world  and if so perhaps Tolkien felt that he himself had been given a faystar that never left himCertainly the beauty and sweetness of Smith of Wootton Major suggest that he had one always  an underrated little tale of magic and faerie which highlights Tolkiens sublime writing   "},
{"title": "The Hobbit",

"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "Librarian note an alternate cover for this edition can be found Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable unambitious life rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbithole in Bag End But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey there and back again They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent a large and very dangerous dragonThe prelude to The Lord of the Rings The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies since its publication in  establishing itself as one of the most beloved and influential books of the twentieth century Some books are almost impossible to review If a book is bad how easily can we dwell on its flaws But if the book is good how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work The Hobbit is at one level simply a charming adventure story perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told There see how simple that was If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable At some level there is little more to say Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces Thats enoughBut if it was only simple entertainment I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book Instead this simple childrens story resonates and fascinates It teases and hints at something larger and grander and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing lecturing or being condescendingAt its heart the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in The Hobbit when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof How often has that idea fascinated meConsider also how the story opens with Bilbos breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit and Gandalfs continual meditation on the meaning of Good morning How much insight is concealed within Gandalfs gentle humor How often do we find ourselves like Bilbo saying something we dont really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning How often do we find ourselves saying I dont mean to be rude but when in fact we mean I very much mean to be rude and here it comes If we did not mean to be rude surely we wouldnt say what we say Instead we mean Im going to be rude but I dont want you to think Im someone who is normally rude or Im going to put myself forward but I dont want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant or even Im going to be rude but I dont want to think of myself as someone who is rude so Im going to pretend Im not being rudeI think that is what makes this more than just a good book but a great one Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or selfloathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form and we have for as long as weve had recorded literature Our comic books are filled with those neopagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to whatever else may be true of them beats people up good These modern Ajaxs Helens and Achilles dominate the box office and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well Oh sure the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt attract the opposite sex and enforce their will upon others but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility How different is Tolkiens protagonist from Heracles Lancelot Beowulf or Batman  short small mundane and weak Of all the principal characters of the story he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute  martial prowessAnd yet he is not actually merely an average Joe Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles its just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isnt the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves Bilbo is gentle He is simple He is humble Power and wealth have little attraction for him He is kind He takes less than his share and that that he takes he gives away He is a peacemaker Though wrongly imprisoned he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him Rather he apologizes for stealing food and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took Though mistreated he harbors no enmity He never puts himself forward but he never shirks when others do How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero and yet how much better we would be if we did How much better off would we be if we like Thorin could declare in our hearts There is more in you of good than you know child of the kindly West Some courage and some wisdom blended in measure If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to beat people up good What real use could we put it too How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbos virtues rather than Achilles speed strength and skill with arms How much less mature does this mere childrens book of a well litworld cause our darker fantasies to seemNow I admit I am biased in my review I read this book  times before the age of  I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading Yet in my defense I will say that Im considered only a moderate fan of the book by many Ive known several devotees of the book who like the protagonist of Bradburys Fahrenheit  can recite whole chapters from memory  ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the worlds technology if only the worlds story tellers survived If you are inclined to think no book can be that good and that my review overhypes it so much the better Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded Forget all I have said save that If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable   There are some days when I actually think that the humble Hobbit is superior to its bohemoth brother    Its a much tighter story and Bilbo is a much more appeal character than is Frodo I also just love this poem from The HobbitFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo seek the pale enchanted goldThe dwarves of yore made mighty spellsWhile hammers fell like ringing bellsIn places deep where dark things sleepIn hollow halls beneath the fellsFor ancient king and elvish lordThere many a gleaming golden hoardThey shaped and wrought and light they caughtTo hide in gems on hilt of swordOn silver necklaces they strungThe flowering stars on crowns they hungThe dragonfire in twisted wireThey meshed the light of moon and sunFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo claim our longforgotten goldGoblets they carved there for themselvesAnd harps of gold where no man delvesThere lay they long and many a songWas sung unheard by men or elvesThe pines were roaring on the heightThe winds were moaning in the nightThe fire was red it flaming spreadThe trees like torches blazed with lightThe bells were ringing in the daleAnd men looked up with faces paleThe dragons ire more fierce that fireLaid low their towers and houses frailThe mountain smoked beneath the moonThe dwarves they heard the tramp of doomThey fled their hall to dying fallBeaneath his feet beneath the moonFar over the misty mountains grimTo dungeons deep and caverns dimWe must away ere break of dayTo win our harps and gold from him   From a hole in the ground came one of my favorite characters of all time the very reluctant and unassuming hero Bilbo Baggins As a child The Hobbit sparked my young imagination causing wonderful daydreams and horrible nightmares As a teen the book made me want to become a writer of fantastical talesor go shoeless live in a hole and smoke a pipe As an adult Tolkiens novel maintains within me a link to my childhood safekeeping cherished memories and evoking everlasting emotions The troubles with trolls those slinking spiders the finding of treasure cave exploration riddles in the darkit all added up in me a love for adventure I would make many an ornate wooden sword in my fathers basement workshop because of Sting Funny I didnt take to wearing rings thoughBeing pintsized Mr Baggins makes the perfect magnetic character for a young person He is about a childs size yet he is mature Similar yet something to aspire to His diminutive stature made his implausible escapes and victories that much more satisfying Nothing bores me more than musclebound killing machines wielding swords the size of windmill blades I have read this fantastic tale a number of times watched the s cartoon movie version countless times and was counting down the days with unabashed eagerness until Peter Jacksons new live action film came out I will continue to read The Hobbit again and again for the road goes ever ever onAppendixish type reviewsThe Hobbit the  animated film version by Rankin  BassThis may be the movie Ive watched the most in my life This is the one I can quote from start to finish and annoy the fuck out of my friends I try to refrain but when John Huston bellows out I am Gandalf and Gandalf means MEwell I just cant help myself Crazyoffhisrocker Brother Theodore as Gollum still astounds me with the sheer depth of his guttural growl Sorry voicestraining Serkis but this is the real Gollum the creepy muthah that kept me up nights Though Rankin  Basss version skips over the whole Beorn scene entirely coming in at  minutes they actually managed to pack in quite a bit of story Certainly it is truncated to absurdity during The Battle of Five Armies but at least its not overblown as appears to be happening with Peter Jacksons unnecessarily long trilogy of this single book The Hobbit or There And Back Again An illustrated book by Rankin  BassThough its a few pages shorter than the regular paperback version this marvelous parttext partillustrated version seems to be unabridged It includes screenshots taken directly from the s cartoon plus where the movie skipped over parts of the book theyve included extra illustrations admittedly of mixed quality Its a little strange to see the same characters rendered differently sitting side by sidebut nonetheless its always fun to see how artists interpret the work especially when its a work dear to your heartThe Hobbit a film version by Peter JacksonIts never fun to see an artist tear the heart out of a work Peter Jackson was given too long a leash when New Line stretched this one book out to three separate movies Instead of one movie packed with awesome we get three that so far Ive yet to see the third and Im not eager to have been watered down and dragged out Extra scenes are added and add nothing Really a sleigh ride chase scene with an incredibly minor character And honestly can Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield act with any other part of his body besides his eyebrows   EDIT  Ive just about had it with people trying to change my mind on every Tolkien review Ive written Please dont comment if youre going to complain Im glad you enjoy his work but Ive given him more than a fair try and I simply dont like his storytelling I am actually allowed to feel that way no matter how scandalous you find that idea Thank you  To be fair it really is a cool story Mr Tolkiens imagination is endless and I respect him immensely for that To be able to conjure a whole new magical world and all these creatures in it absolutely amazing But it is also a very longwinded story and I found myself struggling to get the job done Reading is not supposed to be a job its supposed to be fun and relaxing For me The Hobbit was not an engaging story  I was distracted constantly and kept missing paragraphs The story in itself is pretty great but the way it is told makes the magic disappear I am not quite sure how to explain Maybe it was the way it was written or the fact that they take a long time before anything happens I should also mention the highly anticlimactic end of Smaug and the fact that I cant tell any of the dwarves apart And the songs Dear Merlin the songs I felt like I was in a ruddy musicalIm sad that I didnt like it as much I wish I did In any case still a cool story bro   Maybe one day soon Ill write a proper review of The HobbitIn the meantime I want to say thisIf you are a child you need to read this for Gollums riddlesIf you are an adult you need to read this book to children if you dont have children rent borrow some for at least one opportunity to roleplay GollumBecuz       Click on the link to see a hilarious videoOf course the most compelling reason to add this to your reading list in haste is that its coming to the MOOVIEZZZ Update commentary on the moviez belowBtw if you like kickass fighting elves not to mention pretty kickass sheelves and some sizzling elfdwarf romancewell then you might like the second Hobbit movie more than the book ahemPart  coming to a cinema house near you soonish My PRECCIOOOUUSSSSSand soon Ill have a copy of the all the moviez and they will be me MINE all mine just like my precciousss illustrated copies of the novelHa you didnt think one copy would be enough did youIf you get around used bookstores a lot do look out for an illustrated version of the bookUpdate About the  films by Peter Jackson I didnt find the first  films very memorable He seemed to draw it out almost unbearably and it also felt to me as if he was embellishing the original story a bit The whole thing seemed like actiony rubbish though I personally actually quite enjoyed the swinging shooting swordfighting ninja elves and the bit of romanceBut the THIRD film The Battle of the Five Armies  now that was a good one I almost missed it on the big screen because of the mediocrity of the first two films But I was glad oh so glad that I actually did go and see it The cinematics acting and editing was all very well done but it was the screenwriting and directing that really shone Here we saw a story of courage and cowardice of generosity of greed and avarice of greatness of soul and of smallness of soul of love of selflessness of brotherhood of hatred of humanity of pain of sacrifice of struggle of moral and spiritual victories of sadness and loss but above all of triumph of the soulYes The Battle of the Five Armies  is certainly something that does Tolkien justice at the very least and what a joy it was to behold on the big screen PS The movies also taught us that dwarves CAN be hot   "},

"text": "Over twenty years ago Bill Bryson went on a trip around Britain to celebrate the green and kindly island that had become his home The hilarious book he wrote about that journey Notes from a Small Island became one of the most loved books of recent decades and was voted in a BBC poll as the book that best represents Britain Now for his first travel book in fifteen years Bryson sets out again on a longawaited brandnew journey around the UK Hello Mr Bryson Its been a while Lovely to hear from you again I must admit I got overly excited last year when I learned that you were writing your first travel memoir in years and it was going to be about your adventures in England I love England I loved your earlier book about England Notes from a Small Island and now that were chatting I can honestly say that Ive enjoyed all of your books Although my favorites are that charming one about Australia and that one on hiking the Appalachian Trail Great stuffAnyhoo I was so excited about The Road to Little Dribbling that I preordered it and I started reading it as soon as it arrived It begins with an amusing story of you being hit on the head by a parking barrier ouch and then meeting with your publisher to discuss ideas for your next book He mentioned it had been  years since the publication of Small Island and what a spanking good idea it would be to travel around Britain again It was a good idea You wrote some amusing anecdotes of your travels around England which made me chuckle And you tried to go to different places than you had been before but you did revisit a few spots I especially enjoyed your stories about the Seven Sisters and Runnymede and you included interesting details about whatever region you were in and even some current events Overall it was a delightful readHowever and I mean this as kindly as possible this book was a bit disappointing Now please dont get upset perhaps my expectations were too high and its good to remember how difficult it is to write a fantastic travel memoir But this book just lacked something I finished this weeks ago and since then I have been struggling to put into words why I found it wanting I wasnt one of those readers who found you too grumpy although you do seem a little less charitable than in your previous books but I understand how difficult it is to get older No I think my quibbling comes from the content itself There just wasnt as much meat in this book the stories werent as rich This book was superficial in a way your previous travel memoirs werentAgain please understand I still enjoy your writing and will likely buy whatever book you write next whether its history or another memoir Happy travels to you and please be careful you dont bonk your head againWarm wishes from a fellow native IowanDianeFavorite QuoteWhat a joy walking is All the cares of life all the hopeless inept fuckwits that God has strewn along the Bill Bryson Highway of Life suddenly seem far away and harmless and the world becomes tranquil and welcoming and good And to walk with old friends multiplies the pleasure a hundredfold    What can I say Bryson fans know exactly what they are getting when they pick up one of his books A bit of history information Brysons thoughts and feelings on said information and history A good bit of humor selfdeprecating ironic and at times laugh out loud funny A good combination and that has worked well for him for many years He shares the arcane the personal and the irreverent My one piece of advice If one is ever fortunate to meet this man in person do not go with him to a McDonalds   Bill Bryson represents himself in this book as a grumpy old man and it is frequently hilarious although occasionally verging on the very edge of political correctness Hes does write incredibly well and I found myself reading passages out loud to anyone who would listen and share it with me He wanders between laugh out loud funny and information packed passages with ease and maintained this readers interest nearly all the way through Just a little loss of concentration towards the very end when the jokes thin out and the information becomes a bit dry and over whelming As someone who grew up in England I love the way he pokes fun at the English and yet admires them at the same time I also very much enjoyed the chapters about places I used to know well Four stars because it is not quite as good as some of his others but it was still a great read   BasicallyBut swap in the UK for cloud Ive read all of Brysons other stuff far as I recall I have greatly enjoyed it I laughed so hard at parts of In a Sunburnt Country that I could scarcely breathe But this This is a rambling crotchety old coot and not in a good way There are love poems to verdant landscapes and welldesigned museum spaces But then there are rants against stuff like stupidity that are pretty much complete non sequiturs There are sections about a single museum longer than whats devoted to the entirety of Scotland And Im no expert on UK geography but pretty sure the coverage is awfully lopsided And really if you went somewhere where everything was closed or inaccessible why not leave it out and go elsewhereBryson basically hates cars and parking lots urban development any town thats not stuck in  being denied a predinner drink ugly architecture the public transit experience There is also a number of uncomfortable and socially unacceptable comments that leave one feeling a lot like the moment after That Uncle just said something appalling at Thanksgiving dinnerI might have missed it but I dont recall any mention of a Little Dribbling But frankly you couldnt pay me to go back and look    Brysons funniest book for many years It meant a lot to me since I am also an American expat in England I kept recognizing places Id been and agreeing with the sentiments Two points of criticism though although he moves roughly from southeast to northwest in the country the stops he makes are pretty arbitrary and his subjects of mockery are often what youd call easy targets Do we really need Brysons lead to scorn litterbugs and reality television celebrities Still I released many an audible snort of laughter while reading   "},
{"title": "The Periodic Table",
"isbn": "0805210415",
"author": "Primo Levi",
"text": "Book Jacket Status JacketedThe Periodic Table is largely a memoir of the years before and after Primo Levis transportation from his native Italy to Auschwitz as an antiFacist partisan and a Jew It recounts in clear precise unfailingly beautiful prose the story of the Piedmontese Jewish community from which Levi came of his years as a student and young chemist at the inception of the Second World War and of his investigations into the nature of the material world As such it provides crucial links and backgrounds both personal and intellectual in the tremendous project of remembrance that is Levis gift to posterity But far from being a prologue to his experience of the Holocaust Levis masterpiece represents his most impassioned response to the events that engulfed him The Periodic Table celebrates the pleasures of love and friendship and the search for meaning and stands as a monument to those things in us that are capable of resisting and enduring in the face of tyrannyFrom the Hardcover edition Every suicide is like a nail bomb full of vicious questions and the questions dont care where they land Why didnt somebody do something  theres one Surely there must have been signs Right there is a triple blow delivered to the bereaved partner and immediate family Theyre reeling from the event then they have to conclude this depression this malaise was so acute it blotted out even thoughts of themselves in the suicides final minutes And after that comes the unspoken accusations and avoidings by friends and associates Why didnt they see and having seen taken steps Some suicides still hang like paradoxically visible black holes of misery up in our skies Sylvia Plath van Gogh David Foster Wallace Kurt Cobain Ernest Hemingway BS Johnson Mark RothkoPrimo Levi committed suicide at the age of  in  The repercussions were uniquely distressing He had been the embodiment of an idea that is so cherished its nearly unbearable to think it may not be true The idea that a person can go through the worst and most inhuman experiences in his case Auschwitz and survive not only in body but in spirit too and not become corrupted and not destroyed Levis books were and are the clearesteyed most lucid most carefully discerning and most humane books about the Holocaust I have come across The idea that Auschwitz finally got him  years later that Hitler had extracted one more posthumous victory was horrible And this final act now throws a long shadow over all his great writings so that we loop round on ourselves and almost catch us yelling and denouncing Levi for doing such a thing and then feel instant shame at such a thought This suicide involves Levis readers inevitably in these psychological traps Of course you can argue that the depression and anguish which led to the suicide might have a whole other aetiology of which we are completely ignorant Its possible and its a comforting thought were it not for the continuous theme in his various writings being Auschwitz and the Holocaust from If This is a man  to The Drowned and the Saved  Or  you can argue that it wasnt a suicide at all it was an accident  an old man fell over a balcony There was no note The concierge of the block of flats had spoken to him minutes before he died He seemed okay But both his biographers think it was suicide We have to say that it doesnt matter The work is the thing Rothkos canvasses are not affected one way or another by his death just as Wuthering Heights would be just as great a novel if Emily Bronte had celebrated her th birthday on  July  as World War One was coming to an end It doesnt matterThe Periodic Table is a quirky memoir of a JewishItalian chemist There are elements of cool humour throughout and hardly a trace of bitterness    Chemistry as a metaphor for life Blurb writers love phrases like that They are short succinct and intriguing But how hard is it to write something that would deliver on such a promiseI had never read anything quite like The Periodic Table It more than delivered  it exceeded my expectations The book is a beautiful marriage of life and science perfectly accessible to a regular reader The truth is that anything can be fascinating provided its explained by a person truly passionate about the subject and it doesnt hurt if they are also mindblowingly good writers like Primo Levi You might know Primo Levi as an Auschwitz survivor and you might worry that The Periodic Table would be too dark of a read But it is not If This is A Man Holocaust is still lurking around shadowy corners of this book and it is quite obvious that Primo Levi would be a different kind of writer if it werent for that trauma some might even ask if he would be a writer at all but this collection of anecdotes recollections allegory and glimpses is I would venture to say an ultimately almost positive if not downright optimistic work The very first story might be a little odd and discouraging but either soldier on or skip it altogether  its not really representative of the rest of the book I found reading about the intricacies of a Piedmont dialect with its borrowings from Hebrew rather fascinating I am interested in the process in which words change their meaning entirely not unlike they did in cockney rhyming slang but I can appreciate that such linguistic elaborations are not to everyones tasteFurther chapters  each named after a different chemical element document Levis life as a chemist and they are often funny tender and bittersweet They are intersected with fictional short stories which read like fairy tales and where chemical elements take on almost mythical qualities The most striking story is the penultimate one in which Levi comes across a German who oversaw his work in the laboratory in Auschwitz Like a true scientist Levi wants to rationalise and understand his feelings He wants to know what it is he expects from the encounter His struggle to organise the swarm of emotions is probably the most touching part of the book The Periodic Table is not a science book whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about Its a book about the love for science Its about what every scientist wants us to believe  that their subject is not some obscure knowledge of interest to few but its life and reality that makes us breathe move and think The last story in the collection spells it out for you in case you missed the more subtle hints in the previous chapters I liked it a lot because it reminded of the times when as a little girl I fantasised about the history of atoms in my body  where they had been before me I imagined them as a part of dinosaurs king and queens old houses wild horses The story is Levis crown argument for his thesis that it is only through matter not sprit we can know the universe And this is a thesis I can easily believe in  it appeals to me I am not what you call spritualIf you made it this far in my review I will reward you with a link to an excellent interview with Primo Levi in the Paris Review of Books httpwwwtheparisrevieworgintervi                                                                                                                                                                                The Connotations of the ElementsAll elements have been named in a more or less arbitrary manner after people places or mythological characters To those who named them if not necessarily us these names had metaphorical connotations For nonscientists this significance might be lost in the scientific haze that befuddles usOne achievement of Primo Levis novel is to revive the power of the metaphors Each element he has chosen represents a person an experience or a story Each chapter named after an element assumes both an individual and a collective powerThe collective power resides in the periodic table The tabular presentation of elements not only identifies each element but because of the way it has been structured it also defines their relationshipsIn this way Levis periodic table symbolises individuals families societies and nationsA Literate ChemistScience is the foundation of society even if most of us have forgotten It took a literate chemist capable of striding over the two cultures scientific and creative to remind usLevi recognised that elements rarely manifest themselves to us in a pure unadulterated form They appear in combinations either as mixtures such as air or compound moleculesIt was only in the th century that scientists started to devote a lot of effort to distinguishing the elements from each other They had to be separated They had to be purified but only for analytical purposes Then with greater knowledge of their properties they could be artificially joined as new compoundsThere was no particular functional value in the unadulterated purity of a single element in its own right apart from any beauty that precious metals like silver and gold might be perceived to haveEnchantment and AdulterationLevi reached this conclusion from a scientific point of view The nature of matter is what is of concern to a scientist or chemist Still he managed to find enchantment in matter and its adulteration It is the stuff of life Without adulteration there would be no life and no diversityBit by bit over the course of the book he communicates his enthusiasm happiness and satisfaction to us It is the wonder of someone who is truly aliveRacial PurityEqually importantly Levi extended the metaphor of adulteration to the type of social and political discourse that emerged in the time of FascismThe German and Italian Fascists were trying to achieve purity of their respective races Professor Googlewiki informs me that in  Mussolini referred to the Italians as the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race He later denounced Nordicism although the issue continued to simmer They regarded other races in particular Jews as threats to racial purity Jews supposedly adulterated Aryan perfection They had to be eliminatedWhat was missing was a perception of different races as different elements in the periodic table The universe does not consist solely of one element There are numerous elements and all of them have a role large or small in making the particular universe that we inhabit No one element can be said to adulterate the universeMatter and SpiritRace is a product of matter The Fascists tried to add weight ironically a rhetorical mass or gravitas to their arguments by resorting to the language of spirituality They believed that a race the matter behind the physical manifestation of the race has a spirit However the spirit according to Fascism is superior to and dominates matter It is the desire to preserve and perpetuate the spirit that motivated the political movement behind FascismTo do so other mass other spirit had to be perceived as inferior incorrect defective deviant an impurity something deserving of eliminationJust as in metallurgy ore had to be refined the target metal had to be separated and the impurities discarded on the mullock heap of life or deathThe Fascist modus operandi was to send Jews to extermination camps Levi a Jewish chemist was fortunate to survive the experience because of the value of his scientific skillsTales of Militant ChemistryFor all the horror that the author experienced and witnessed his novel is not just a compendium of tales of militant chemistry It is an exercise in tolerance of those who would commit or permit evil as long as they are prepared to repent His message is one of forgiveness for those who acknowledge the wrong they didThe chapters are named after  elements I havent tried to analyse why each one of these elements was chosen or whether there is any significance in the order Im sure that if you were prepared to put in the effort it would be like understanding the structure of Joyces UlyssesThese are a Few of My Favourite ElementsThe novel starts with    an inert gas one incapable of aggregation with other elements Levi applies it to his Jewish family although he denies that they were wholly inactiveThe little that I know about my ancestors presents many similarities to these gases Not all of them were materially inerton the contrary they were  or had to be  quite active in order to earn a living and because of a reigning morality that held that he who does not work shall not eat But there is no doubt that they were inert in their inner spirits inclined to disinterested speculation witty discourses elegant sophisticated and gratuitous discussion    a rare but vital element applies to a brief love interest which never really eventuated because of the warWe are not dissatisfied with our choices and with what life has given us but when we meet we both have a curious and not unpleasant impression which we have both described to each other several times that a veil a breath a throw of the dice deflected us onto two divergent paths which were not ours   is the river Dora which represents youth joy life and friendship even when it is lost The    chapter details the reunion of two friends two positive heroes at the th anniversary of their graduationEach of us would gather more stories like this one in which stolid matter manifests a cunning intent upon evil and obstructionThe name of the element    derives from the Old Norse Vanadis which is one of the variants of the name of the goddess of love Freya or Freydis who might also be familiar to W T Vollmann fans It is the chapter in which Levi explores forgiveness and repentance a way out of the horror of the HolocaustThis is What MattersThe final chapter is    Here Levi acknowledges that his book is neither a chemical treatise nor an autobiography except to the extent that like every other piece of writing it is partial and symbolic Instead it is a microhistory with a scattering of sad tatters and trophies both failures and successesYet this chapter asserts how fundamental to life are atoms elements of the periodic table Carbon atoms travel from one form of life to another from an organic form to an intermediate inorganic form back to organic life Carbon atoms travel through time passing on their characteristics to other matter around themThe focus of this chapter is elements atoms molecules Chemical energy becomes mechanical energy and mechanical energy generates heat Such is lifeYet the great beauty of the novel is that it tells the story of people living loving giving birth parenting and perpetuating both life and love over the agesThis is matter This is what matter does This is what matters The Marvel of DiversityBy the end of the novel you marvel at humanity and its diversity You value each and every life No thing doesnt matter No life doesnt matter The novel subtly encourages you to care It makes you want to behave like you care Conversely you struggle to understand that Fascists might have looked at the same people as we do and didnt careThis novel is almost an afterthought to two earlier works by Levi about the Holocaust If This Is a Man and The Truce It even leaves gaps where the earlier books would have fit It houses them makes a home for them It is a periodic table into which these other elements fit perfectly This novel is rich in its own right but it invites us to read his other works to wander around the whole periodic table one element at a timeThe sense of this man Primo Levi who is now no longer with us makes me want to read his other works so that like an atom of carbon his legacy of vitality creativity love and forgiveness can live on transcending both his life and his death   I read this book several years ago and every so often see something about it here on GR Perhaps I will write a real review someday but I would need to reread itFor a real review of Levis book here on Goodreads check out httpswwwgoodreadscomreviewshow Levi is well known as a survivor of Auschwitz a writer of great talent and great humanity He died a probable suicide in I thought what Id do right now is give a link to a recent article in the New Yorker by James Wood Its basically a Levi retrospective and without mentioning the new book at all unless I missed it in a sentence presumably written to coincide with The Complete Works of Primo Levi published about a week ago in three slipcased volumes with an Introduction by Toni MorrisonWood discusses The Periodic Table extensively in the piece and also writes movingly of Levis memoirs available together in If This Is a Man  The

{"title": "Cosmos",
"isbn": "0375508325",
"author": "Carl Sagan",
"text": "Cosmos has  heavily illustrated chapters corresponding to the  episodes of the Cosmos television series In the book Sagan explores  billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of science and civilization Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method mixing science and philosophy and speculates to the future of science The book also discusses the underlying premises of science by providing biographical anecdotes about many prominent scientists throughout history placing their contributions into the broader context of the development of modern scienceThe book covers a broad range of topics comprising Sagans reflections on anthropological cosmological biological historical and astronomical matters from antiquity to contemporary times Sagan reiterates his position on extraterrestrial lifethat the magnitude of the universe permits the existence of thousands of alien civilizations but no credible evidence exists to demonstrate that such life has ever visited earth                  httpwwwyoutubecomplaylistlist   I wonder what Carl Sagan may have thought of  and the world in the new millennium a strifetorn place which is being shaken up and shaken out every moment I imagine the civil but slightly horrified and slightly bemused tone he may have employed while talking about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and the antics of the Bush administration which have become such excellent fodder for stand up comedians the world over And I can almost detect the note of boyish enthusiasm in his voice while he may have spoken of the Higgs Boson and explained the reasons behind the incorrect observation readings of the neutrinos being speedier than light particles experiment that had made the headlines a few years agoI can only imagine because he wasnt there to witness these watershed events and he isnt here to offer comment criticism or share his inexhaustible repository of knowledge with us any longer His time in the Cosmos had run out within two decades of the publication of this work  a testament to his own belief in the staggering inferiority of our evanescent lifetimes in the scheme of the universes   It would be nice if I could summarize each one of the  chapters of Cosmos and give readers the lowdown on our painstakingly slow but rewarding crawl through the fabric of space and time the civilizational hurdle race towards a finish line which we can neither begin to envision nor fully comprehend yet I could write a review in the conventional format leaving you with a gentle nudge to read this book as soon as you canOr instead I could simply write about how despite being more than  years outdated Carl Sagans voice of reason rings truer than ever cutting through the heart of all the din and chaos of our troubled times I could just tell you how Sagans deep and abiding love for nature and humanity reverberates in every page of this work and how our scientific endeavours across timelines and geographical boundaries across the unending void which surrounds us on all sides symbolize our collective pursuit of knowledge  The Cold War is a now defunct appendage of our history the Soviet Union is no more America has achieved a milestone in its race relations by welcoming its first African American President But turmoil in the world order persists  the nuclear arms race between the Americans and the Soviets has been replaced by a newer dance of dominance in the Asia Pacific region The world is as much embroiled in a mesh of steadily growing list of challenges as it was in the past if not more Preposterous decrees issued by fanatical outfits blatant human rights violations infringement on freedom of speech and expression diplomatic armwrestling the everenthusiastic decriers of science War on Women the shouts of the globalwarming deniers reign supreme still The players may have changed faces but the game of petty oneupmanship in the arena of global politics still continues unabatedWhich is why Sagans rousing call for all of mankind to unite under the identity of citizens of the Cosmos and not as citizens of a nation moves me to the core of my being His recapitulation of our scientific advancements achieved against the tide of adverse circumstances of the victories won in the face of persecution by religious authority impresses upon us a sense of urgency  that with the exponential increase in the defense budgets of the global powers the incentive given to the greatest minds of our times to devote time and energy to unraveling the mysteries of the Cosmos is reduced As the concept of nuclear deterrence receives a pat on the back the global arms sales numbers continuing to soar despite hollow promises of arms control more and more scientists are being engaged in improving weapons technology rather than validating the fact of our existence against the intimidating presence of the stars galaxies and universes The NASA budget cuts of recent times are proof of this ignominyIs it to this end that the ancient advanced cities like Alexandria the destroyed civilizations of Ionia and the Aztecs and pioneers such as Eratosthenes Democritus Aristarchus Hypatia Leonardo da Vinci Copernicus Galileo Johannes Kepler Tycho Brahe Christiaan Huygens Issac Newton and Albert Einstein worked tirelessly for To further intensify mutual national antagonism and increase our probability of complete selfannihilationSagan thinks not   This is why I cant help but agree quite heartily with someone who says If I had a religion I would be a Carl Saganian  If there is only one worldly diktat we must abide by with unquestioning faith let it be this one   The Star system in GR is absolutely inadequate for rating this book Gosh I should not use the term absolutely for something in which everything orbits around relativityAnyway I think something like this would give a better idea of my opinion about this book my rating is an universe of zillions to the power of zillions of stars and expanding My ratingWhat a brilliant read this has been I have read it very slowly one chapter a week But what are thirteen weeks in relation to cosmic time I have also read it in parallel to watching the DVD programs What a treat this has been to have Carl Sagan in the little and measurable and limited space of my living room bringing home and explaining to me the immensity of all that space and dust and gas and light and fire and immeasurable timeSagans mind is truly cosmic in scope and in outlook We accompany him as he pulls together history with the preSocratic the Alexandrians Leonardo Kepler and Tycho Brahe Huygens Einstein with the basics of biology and chemistry and physics and astronomy I particularly liked his explanation of the effects of Relativity on the light spectrum on board of an Italian Vespa in a true Pasolini manner I smiled at the candid StarTreckish nave from which we travel through his halfobservedhalffictional universe I gasped to see he was using a touch screen to navigate his craft realizing this would have seemed so fancy back in the early s when Sagans program and book were all the rage and which for us is now so irritatingly ubiquitousI loved his survey of the Lives of Stars and his anecdote of his first trip to the library as a kid when upon his request for a book on stars the Librarian gave him a book on Hollywood actors and actresses Startling are also the simulations in the film version of the encounter of various objects and any given galaxy UnforgettableThe contents are primarily a laudable exposition of what he calls the language of the universethe language of science which he deciphers as if he were handling a Rosetta stone of multiple dimensions But a running argument and I suspect one motivation behind this wondrous book and program is his deeply human and humane quest to undo our main enemies superstition and violenceProduced during the Cold War the book seems a mission launched to make us aware of our origins and our circumstances and increase our awareness of the possibilities of selfdestruction His work is an epic from a savior with a cosmic projectionBut the most precious impression I have gathered in this reading is a reminder of how infinitesimally small I am and the inconsequence of my being But also how in spite of my own insignificance how lucky I am to be one more specimen of this wondrous phenomenon of evolution through which a conscience is formed in a strange and extraordinary combination of a few natural elementsRather than depressing I have found this thought heartening A reminder that I have to enjoy it while it lastsWhich means to keep reading books and bask in the knowledge transmitted to me through this wonderful medium invented by us Sagan after all begins and ends his account with the Alexandrian LibraryHe understood         httpssaudomarwordpresscom

           Im not sure what I could possibly say about Cosmos that hasnt already been said by countless others in the  years since its publication and likely in a far more intelligent and eloquent way than I ever could But upon recently reading this book for the first time which may seem a bit belated but I am after all only  it instantly became one of my favorites a status not easily attained by any book and so I feel compelled to say something to expound upon its many virtues and why it has endeared itself to me so completelyOne glance at a book and you hear the voice of another personperhaps someone dead for thousands of years Across the millennia the author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head directly to you Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions binding together people citizens of distant epochs who never knew one another Books break the shackles of timePerhaps prophetically this is exactly the effect the late great Dr Sagan acheived with this book Through the power and fluid elegance of his prose while reading Cosmos I could almost hear that familiar and somehow majestic voice which in large part I believe made the PBS miniseries of the same name so wholly entrancing as if the two of us were old friends having a leisurely albeit profoundly intellectual chat over coffee Not exactly what one might expect from a book largely concerned with science but this is just one of many qualities that makes it not only endearing to the reader but alsoand perhaps more importantlyaccessible making even the smattering of complex equations seem casual and undauntingAside from the beauty of its prose which is at times poetic in its depth and its eloquence Cosmos is also wholly engaging and fascinating in the depth and scope of its subects Sagan succinctly and expertly covers everything from the birth of stars to the birth of science the origins of life on Earth to the possibility of life on other planets and our far distant and recent in the grand cosmic scheme of things past to the possibilities for our distant future And yes because science is constantly evolving and as Dr Sagan states selfcorrecting some of the information and theories covered may now be outdated but I still believe that Cosmos is well worth reading Not only can it serve as a friendly accessible and engrossing jumpingoff point for we common folk who are interested in delving deeper into science but may feel a bit intimidated it is also if nothing else worth reading for the beautifully poignant and evocative insights and the oftphilosophical tidbits contained thereinWe are the local embodiment of the Cosmos grown to selfawareness We have begun to contemplate our origins starstuff pondering the starsMy only complaints about Cosmos are these the last two or three chapters lag just a bit incorporating several topics that seem extraneous and unnecessary and somewhat lose the smooth easy flow present throughout the rest of the book and though I feel that in the current world political climate the section discussing nuclear arms is still as relevant today as then I cant help but think that anybody above the age of  and possessing a fullyfunctioning cerebral cortex is already aware of the potential consequences of nuclear war gamma burst radiation poisoning junk in the atmosphere nuclear winter death doom destruction we get it already However I can concede on this last point that at the time of publication the aftermath of a fullscale nuclear war was perhaps still a pretty hot topic And in the grand scheme these negative points make up only a negligible fraction of this otherwise fantastic book and do not in anyway detract from its intrinsic value or from its overall enjoyabilityAll in all Cosmos is a thoroughly enthralling read that takes you on a breathtaking journey from the inception of the Universe to futures that may never be and allows us to ponderwhen considering our own epic journey from starstuff to assemblages of a billion billion billion atoms contemplating the evolution of atomswhat it truly means to be human and what our place our purpose is in the vast expanse of this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky   "},

"author": "Rachel Joyce",
"text": " When Queenie Hennessy discovers that Harold Fry is walking the length of England to save her and all she has to do is wait she is shocked Her note had explained she was dying How can she wait A new volunteer at the hospice suggests that Queenie should write again only this time she must tell Harold everything In confessing to secrets she has hidden for twenty years she will find atonement for the past As the volunteer points out Even though youve done your travelling youre starting a new journey too Queenie thought her first letter would be the end of the story She was wrong It was the beginning While I was reading The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I often wondered about who Queenie Hennessy really was and why Harold Fry would make a trek walking hundreds of miles to see her before she dies  Rachel Joyce in this novel has answered all of the questions I had about Queenie and I now know that she was worth every mile that Harold walked and then some Queenie is in a hospice spending her last days writing a letter to a man she worked with at a brewery in an English town  At the same time that man  Harold Fry is on a walking journey to see her before she dies  We learn so much about Queenie in her letter  about her childhood her days at the university where she studied the classics  her losses  her time working with Harold and how she spent her days after leaving  living in a beach house and tending her beloved sea garden There should be nothing light about this story  A dying woman is in hospice writing a letter seeking forgiveness  New patients come and others die  But yet it was delightful to come to know some of Queenies fellow patients who will make you laugh as well as cry  These characters will steal your heart  The feisty and sometimes potty mouthed Finty  Pearly King  Barbara  Mr  Henderson Finty was my favorite as she takes to Twitter  Harold Fry Queenie Hennessy hospice  respect The story at some point becomes about more than Harolds walk and more than Queenies letter but about this group of patients and these lovely nuns especially Sister Mary Inconnu who types out Queenies notes and gives her so much more  They drink to Harold with their nutritional drinks and then the reality of it  Barbara wishes for one more Christmas  A particularly moving scene was when Sister Mary Inconnu helps Queenie to feel and smell a peach and taste it when she didnt think she could swallow  Harolds journey on the road and Queenies journey waiting for Harold becomes theirs as well  Thats it  then  said Finty  Its a unanermous vote From now on  no one dies  Were all waiting for Harold Fry This book is about living and dying with dignity  friendship  love  about regrets and acceptance  and how people have the capacity to make people who dont know them  fall in love with them I suppose that you could read Queenies story on its own since it really is not a sequel but has been called a companion piece telling the story of their journeys simultaneously I would say do yourself a favor and read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry in order to fully experience just how meaningful the lives of these far from ordinary people were to those around them Ill be thinking about the ending and that last letter to Harold for a long time  Thanks to Random House Publishing Group  Random House and NetGalley I really loved this book and while reading it I reread parts The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and after doing so decided that it was a  star book instead of  as I had originally rated it  I have changed my rating   I actually enjoyed this even more than The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry At first I was not so sure because Queenie came across as a very insipid and needy person and I wondered how she was going to sustain a whole book But then the story moved into the hospice and up popped all these marvellous characters I ended up enjoying the parts of the story about the hospice much more than the parts relating to her past life and Harold Fry The author achieved a remarkable balance between happy and sad and it was so good to see Queenie finally realise her life had not been so bad after all The end ties in very neatly with the ending of its companion volume Very well done indeed and I will certainly read more books by Rachel Joyce   As much as I loved The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I liked this one even more Both of these books contain the stories of ordinary lives made extraordinary because of the actions of the characters to connect with others Harolds story was his walking  miles to see Queenie before she died Queenies story was about her wait for him in the hospice to stay alive until he arrived Along the way we get both their historiesWaiting with Queenie are the other dying patients at the hospice and the gentle nuns who care for them Harolds postcards sent from the road give them all a small measure of hope that they too can hang on to await his arrival Where we get Harolds story from his thoughts and encounters along the road Queenie relates her history in a letter to Harold since she can no longer speak because of her tumor We know from the first book that Harold gets to Queenie just before she dies but there is a surprising twist at the end regarding her letterThis was a wonderful book with a lot of everyday wisdom that slips up on you as you read like this passage It has been everywhere my happiness  when my mother sang for me to dance when my father took my hand to keep me safe  but it was such a small plain thing that I mistook it for something ordinary and failed to see We expect our happiness to come with bells and whistles but it doesntIf you read Harold Fry you owe it to yourself to finish the journey with Queenie Oh and a special note to Rachel Joyce  I want Finty to have her own book   Not a    prequel or sequel but a parallel story told in Queenies firstperson narration as an extended deathbed letter as she waits for Harold to arrive The humortinged hardship of hospice life alternates with touching vignettes from her past Better than the original  more inventive allusive and intimateWhen I saw Joyce speak at the  Hungerford Literary Festival she mentioned that she wrote Harold Fry and Queenie Hennessy simultaneously emphasizing the idea that these two characters are journeying side by side In fact Joyce revealed that there are plot crossovers between the novels For instance towards the end of his walk Harold has to tape his yachting shoes onto his feet to finish writing her letter Queenie asks a nun to tape her pencil into her gripMy life has been small it has been nothing to speak of But the past is still inside me Harold I have never let it go It is a privilege to hear Queenies voice hereSee my full review at The Bookbag    This is my last read of While Harold Fry is walking through England and Queenie is trying to hold on and wait till he arrives before she dies she writes him a letter confessing secrets hidden for twenty years I liked reading Queenies story and about her unrequited love for Harold I liked the interaction between her and David Harolds son though I dont think Id have been as generous as she was I loved reading about her sea garden The writing is beautiful especially the description of the Northumberland Coast I sat with my suitcase and while I ate the bread and drank the water I gazed out over the bay The sun was high and threw stars at the sea The air shimmered with heat like a veil of water I was right there with Queenie This is a book about love and loss living and dying I loved this If only memory were a library with everything stored where it should be If only you could walk to the desk and say to the assistant Id like to return the painful memories about  and take out some happier ones please And also sometimes you cannot clear the past completely You must live alongside your sorrowSo I enjoyed the writing except for the intrusive f word that popped up at times Some of the people in the hospice were certainly characters and the nuns caring for them lovely But the main impression I was left with after reading this book is I hope and pray I never have to go into a nursing home or a hospice It sounds like my idea of hell   "},

independently of the memory of the last  years of reading each eagerly awaited book one by one with utmost delight It is impossible for me to read a new Terry Pratchett without my vivid recollection of him eyes twinkling from under the brim of his hat as he signed my precious books and answered my breathless Mr it was ages ago Pratchett thank you so much for all the hours of reading pleasure with Madam thank you so much for all your money It is impossible for me to read a new Terry Pratchett without seeing the elephant in the room of the Alzheimers PCA variant looking for its heavy footsteps possibly crushing the words on the page and remembering how I sobbed when I saw his soulbearing BCC documentary about the cruel reality of his diseaseWhat Im clumsily trying to say is that its impossible for me to now separate the man from his writing and to separate his writing from my own life He is his writing it is the expression of his philosophy and his social conscience His writing has been a constant presence for more than half my life Discworld has been the stage for his social commentary one that has always resonated with my personal values One with a special humour Monty Pythonesque and quintessentially British in flavourDodger is very similar but uses Victorian London as a backdrop to highlighting the sweeping social changes of the times the contrast between classes and the striving of a few more privileged persons to understand the marginalised and deprived sectors of society It is fun it is a romp it has wit and wisdom and eloquence It is thoroughly researched and authentic in setting with artistic licence and language modern USA persons are going to struggle with many of the wordsSir Terry is definitely still with us the elephant is browsing quietly I wish you well Sir Terry you are a treasure and my life is very much richer for your contribution and your continued presence    A couple weeks ago I was having a real pisser of a day Then I remembered there was a new Terry Pratchett book out and things didnt seem so bad anymore When I first started to read it I got two surprises The first was that it wasnt a Discworld book Which Im fine with given how much I loved Nation The other surprise was the language of the book To be completely honest and Im really embarrassed to admit this when I started reading the book I thought that Terrys Alzheimers had finally progressed to such a degree that it had really damaged his ability to write at the sentencelevel About two pages in I realized he was actually mimicking Victorian prose which is a lot different than his usual breezy style of writing Once I realized that it only took about three pages to get used to the new style and enjoy it After that I didnt find the language clunky at all In brief all Pratchetts usual wit cleverness and humor is here Theres also the added benefit of seeing Victorian London through Dodgers eyes and while Pratchett romanticizes it somewhat he obviously knows the time period well    First a disclaimer As virtually a lifelong Pratchett fan I would probably buy anything he publishes If he were to release a book titled World of Poo I would probablyoh NevermindThe point Im making is that I cant be objective when it comes to this author  the Discworld books are too much a part of my life I cried while watching TPs deeply personal euthanasia documentary I know certain Discworld characters better than I know members of my extended familyBut this is a review of Dodger  not an essay on why I love DW  so here it isThough colourful and engagingly written this isnt a very good bookIt isnt awful and there is plenty of fun historical trivia but I wouldnt recommend it Instead I would steer newbie readers to the City Watch William dW or Moist vL episodes of DiscworldThe most glaring problem here is the GodmodeGary Stulike protagonist In the space of approximately a week the teenage tosher sewage scavenger with questionable personal hygiene receives not one but two fairygodfather like makeovers and is accepted by the cream of London society at a fancy soiree wins the heart of a beautiful multilingual Princess despite barely exchanging three sentences Middle aged women are also apparently magnetically drawn to the young urchin  throwing themselves at the teen demanding kisses in exchange for their assistance displays the fighting skills of Greebo the skinny teenager easily outmanoeuvres the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and professional assassins is recognised as a national hero and showered with money by grateful citizens who provide free coach rides in exchange for his autograph meets Queen Victoria probably the most powerful person in the world at that time  and is accepted as virtually her equal Although to be fair this occurred several months after his ascension to national heroThe other problem that I have is the use of real historical figures such as Dickens Mayhew Disreali Robert Peel etc I got the impression that Sir Terry included people he respects and admires and perhaps this is part of the problem overlooking the implausibility of these gentleman all happening to take an interest in Dodger during a single week the characters never really came to life for me I got the impression that I was reading about cardboard placeholders for the real men rather than the living breathing and flawed characters that inhabit TPs other novelsAnd this brings me to my next issue which is possibly controversial the historical figures were all middleclass or wealthy dogooders concerning themselves with charity towards the deserving poor There was no mention of working class figures of the industrial era organised labour movement  the movement that would culminate in arguably the biggest ever shift in British society the postwar Labour victory that led to the NHS radical redistribution of wealth the grammar schools and free University education  all of which would have fundamentally shaped TPs childhood and adult opportunitiesPerhaps it isnt surprising that these working class heroes  who were fighting for a fairer society for everyone  were not included Because Dodger is fundamentally a ragstoriches tale where the audience is asked to empathise with and applaud Dodgers rise to join the upper classes while throwing out the occasional sixpence whenever he feels a twinge of guilt Appropriately the book ends with the new Sir Dodger engaged in the robbery of a priceless historical treasure a tiara once belonging to Marie Antoinette No he is not intending to sell it and distribute the money to the many starving orphansgirls driven to prostitution who populate the book in an Animal Farm like ending Dodger is stealing Marie Antoinettes tiara for his new wife a former Princess Great lesson for the kids TerryDespite the above issues this could have been an engaging read if the antagonists had been more fleshed out something that Pratchett is normally incredibly good at If we had been introduced to the Outlander and her possibly conflicted henchman earlier and been led to feel truly terrified and slightly awed by the assassins ruthlessness and cunning as well as sympathy for her henchman it might have broken up the Gary Stuness of the tale it might also have given us a true sense of fear for Dodger and Simplicity Additionally it would have been a chance to show us early Victorian Britain a through the eyes of an outsiderLastly wtf was up with Dodgers mentor Solomon When we first meet him he is apparently so downatheel that he lives in a slum and eagerly awaits Dodgers scavenged scraps of meat a few chapters later and it turns out that he is known and well spokenof by the most influential and wealthy people in the country  he exchanges a secret handshake with Prince Albert and shares a laugh with him regarding their mutual acquaintancethe King of Sweden Willing suspension of disbelief can only be stretched so farUltimately this can be viewed as either a competently written watereddown Dickens fanfic Dodgers real name is Pip Stick he grew up in a workhouse etc etc or a not very successful attempt to deconstruct the Dickensian novelIt can also be viewed as an inspirational tale for children which teaches them to um steal from the innocent for personal gain vandalise the property of people who happen to be from the same country as one bad apple and elope with a girl you hardly know  who happens to have lovely hair And not to bother with school or even basic literacy  because crime is so much more rewardingAnd yet despite all of the above and my disappointment in Snuff for fairly similar reasons Ill continue to buy any new Pratchett novel in the hope that it contains some of the old Discworld magic  moments of which though few were still present here Which is probably what his publishers are banking onAt least there was less scatology in this one   Dodger by Terry Pratchett narrated by Stephen Briggs I listened to this on audio and I dug the narrator I dug him a lotThis book was funny and fun A lot of the humor was laugh out loud funny and a lot of the fun was in spotting the real folk amidst all the fictional charactersI had a blast listening to this and if I could afford it I would listen to the entire Discworld series narrated by Mr Briggs Alas I cannot so I guess I still have to read them   Without wanting to get in to yet another debate with  something adults about the legitimacy of said adults reading novels meant for tweens is there another author working in the YA field who treats said YAs with as much respect and intelligence as Terry Pratchett I seriously doubt it If there were I wouldnt hold the publisher manufactured genre in such contemptDodger is most assuredly a YA novel a softening of Pratchetts usual intelligent discussion of humanity and witty banter but not to the extent that it is painful to read for those of us with a more adult reading level Taking his most wondrous creation of AnkhMorpork back to its roots the documented reality of Victorian London and exploring the origin and nature of many of his past favourite protagonistheroes once more this time in the form of the cheeky geezer tosher extraordinaire Dodger Dodger follows the well trodden path of Vimes Carrot and most recently Moist von Lipwig from inauspicious beginnings through a series of sticky adventures to come up smelling of roses I dont think it is a coincidence that Pratchett often writes mysteries as they are perfectly suited to the somewhat grey heroes he likes to createIn this adventure Dodger saves the life of a damsel in distress one stormy London night and sets in motion a series of events that will change both of their lives forever taking in several historical figures along the way Sir Robert Peel Henry Mayhew Benjamin Disraeli Charles Babbage Joseph Bazalgette Angela BurdettCoutts and VA themselves are amongst the celebrity cameos shoehorned in to the story all of which irritated the cynical side of me who will usually abhor this kind of shortcut to bond with a lazy reader but Pratchett goes about it in such a way that it is both entertaining and educational they are there for a reason not just because its cute and gimmicky whereas the first appearance of a certain Mister Charlie Dickens made me groan quite loudly in exasperation and sadly it never felt important to the plot that this particular character be Charles Dickens in my opinion there is never really a reason for using Dickens or Poe amongst others in your fiction but the author should at least make proper use of the baggage such a famous historical figure carries and for once Pratchett disappointed on this countAs with almost all Pratchett novels this is a wonderfully entertaining and fast paced read that surely will not disappoint anyone Dodger is another first class example of a master storyteller in full command of his abilities Once more two middle fingers are being stuck up firmly in the face of the disease currently at battle with Terry Pratchett and long may they continue to do so   "},

"author": "Cheryl Strayed",
"text": " NATIONAL BESTSELLER SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTUREAt twentytwo Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything In the wake of her mothers death her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed Four years later with nothing more to lose she made the most impulsive decision of her life With no experience or training driven only by blind will she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State  and she would do it aloneTold with suspense and style sparkling with warmth and humor Wild powerfully captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened strengthened and ultimately healed her I finished this book a couple of days ago and have not been able to get it out of my mind I was happily coming to Goodreads to give my glowing review but was pretty annoyed at a few of the recent reviews so I wanted to address that first The bravery and honesty that flowed from those pages touched me deep into my soul and to see her described as dimwitted and self absorbed is insulting to the author and to those of us who were moved by her story If you want to read about a well planned trip by a prepared hiker who has no issues go and buy a guide book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail Im sure youll find it very informativeWild is a beautifully descriptive story about loss pain nearly giving up and pushing on I felt like I was right there next to Cheryl my pack so heavy my feet bleeding and sore filthy hungry and lonely I couldnt believe she kept going but also would have been crushed if she hadnt I loved every moment of this book and am just blown away by the authors audacity and courage I will probably never be able to go three months in the wild but I sure loved living vicariously through Cheryl in her Wild    starsWhat kind of dimwit would decide to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail alone with zero backpacking experience Apparently the same kind of dimwit who would try heroin just because the stranger she spent the night with happens to need a fixIf you can tolerate essence of dingbat and overlook her lousy choices and even lousier excuses for those choices this is actually an enjoyable read You have to roll your eyes a lot while working to the point where she hits the trail but after that its quite engaging I admire her tenacity in finishing what she started given her cluelessness about backpacking that led to serious mistakes and potentially dangerous miscalculations If youve never backpacked before use this as a cautionary tale rather than an excuse to be a ditz Many people with more backpacking savvy than Cheryl have lost their lives through poor planning or just bad luck The thing that saves this book is that Cheryl writes well If I can say without unkindness that theres a certain charm in her idiocy this is what makes her story worth reading And if you have any backpacking stories of your own youll connect with so many of the little things that define the worldwide community of backpackers    I have read a great many criticisms of this book by people who either expected it to be solely about the PCT itself or were offended by the authors use of coarse language and discussion of her sexual proclivities And thats fine all of those readers were obviously seeking something other than what this book had to provide Myself I enjoyed it from cover to cover A longtime lover of the PCT I already know about the trail from end to end I was more interested in how the author used a rather spontaneous journey along the trail to help herself face demons and come to grips with her mothers death There are moments where her emotions are so clearly spelled out on the page and then there are times where you have to read between the lines But every step of the way youre alongside her watching as she learns to accept to embrace to let go and how the PCT weaves through thatThis is a book I will most definitely read multiple times over the years I almost regret buying it in Kindle format because I can think of at least five people Id love to loan it to and demand they read it immediately   I know what Cheryl felt like on the Pacific Crest Trail because I felt like that reading her book Neverending Arduous But without that whole enlightenment part Warning Spoilers Wahhh I did heroin and cheated on my husband and my lifes a mess Wahhh Im too tired to even masturbate Wah I slept without protection and got an abortion I lost my toenailz I have godzilla skin on my hips because my backpack weighs so much Had sex anywayz BTDUBS I like sex Seriously she had this problem with sleeping around with men and toward the end of her trek shes STILL sleeping with strangers Her body made all these changes but shes STILL the same person on the inside So pardon me for not finding that inspirationalHer mom died and I feel super bad about that But I couldnt really follow Cheryl on her journey because I just cant connect with a half ass femmeNazi Its fitting that she had a hard time reading a real compass because her moral compass was also offkilter Should have read about Bill Brysons trek across the Appalachian Trail instead   EDIT  I changed this from two stars to one because I realized that its been about two years since I read this book and I still get ragey and fistshakey just thinking about how much it sucked So bonus star deducted This book sucks on wheels Read on for moreOkay I gave myself plenty of time to cool off before writing this review because man was I ever pissed at this book by the time I finished reading it And I really wanted to love it Im a backpacker and Ive often fantasized about doing the PCT solo a pretty stupid idea for anybody whos not much more experienced than I am I was excited about a memoir of one womans experience on the trail I dug into this book eagerly but within a few chapters my enthusiasm began to deflate and by the end I was basically doing this at every other paragraphAfter some coolingoff time I gave it what I feel is a very generous two stars That bonus star is for the first couple of chapters which do in fact pull a person in and which do share some impressive openness on the authors part I was particularly impressed with her ability to share her weird dreams about killing her mother which were raw and real and touching and disturbing Also the scene where she recalls how view spoiler the horse is put down  was particularly affecting Otherwise this book just doesnt have all that much to offer Cheryl Strayeds life doesnt so far have an unusual amount of sadness or tragedy or inspiring moments  the kind of things that make for good memoir reading Or if her life does contain those things shes not a good enough writer to make the reader feel it Brief rundown Strayed lost a loving parent with whom she had a great relationship and had a very difficult time accepting that loss Not particularly different from the experiences of many people Ive met As a result of her grief she lost all impulse control and sabotaged her marriage to a really wonderful man then started using heroin Okay thats a little more interesting but unfortunately the full impact of these momentous choices is lost in an unblazed forest of vague unremarkable prose and confused chronology making it hard to give a damn At the nadir of her downward spiral she hears about the PCT and just decides to hike it which is not surprising I guess since shes proudly established that she suffers from a total lack of impulse control a condition she never really seems to try to correct throughout the course of the book So hike it she does all unprepared derping off into the wilderness as is par for the course apparently She cant even be assed to read the essential and very short I might add book Staying Found The Complete Map and Compass Handbook an absolute essential for anybody who determines to walk off into the wilderness and survive by whatever she can carry on her back Oh she bothered to buy the book but she neglected to read even a page of it on the flight from Minnesota or wherever shes from to southern California although she brought it on board the plane intending to educate herself BEFORE she began her blissedout hippie walkabout But I guess hey free peanuts and a bad Adam Sandler movie soIf youre getting the impression from the review that this memoir fails mostly because Strayed just doesnt make herself a very sympathetic character youre getting the right idea But it gets worse Once she actually gets the high of hiking under the weight of a pack HALF HER BODY WEIGHT for gods sake the book becomes Mary Sue Goes on a Nature WalkEverybody  yes literally everybody except the gay guy and a couple of women wants to have sex with her She is that irresistible all hairy and smelling like a sasquatch and hobbling from miles of carrying half her body weight All the men she meets eye her appraisingly Most of them hit on her and ask her out for dinner and drinks waitdinner and drinks on the Pacific Crest Trail Yes more on that later One of them actually does seduce her with the erotic power of his Wilco tshirt But the one message she clearly wants you to take away from her allegedly inspiring story of a complete personal transformation on the PCT is that the author is preternaturally sexy and virtually nothing with a penis can resist her Strayeds relentless hotness actually becomes such a prevalent theme that I began laughing out loud each time she described yet another man expressing his interest in her hot hiker self I laughed a lot O Reader I laughed a lotDont worry those people she met who didnt want to stick their trekking poles into her worshiped her for other reasons Every single person she met except for some Totally Grumpy Old Camp Hosts and a couple creepy hunters who still wanted to have sex with her couldnt stop telling her how amazing and wonderful she was for hiking the PCT alone Without any knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness Everyone said things to reinforce her belief that she was a badass motherfucking Amazonian queen Hooray The world is your oyster cause thats all the world isHow did she meet so many people hiking one of the leasttrammeled of the worldfamous trails on the continent Well Strayed actually didnt hike all that much of the trail She started well north of the Mexican border and had to take a Greyhound around most of the High Sierras because it was socked in that year and she was unprepared for snow hiking as she was for most other contingencies She got rid of her ice axe after crossing one small snowfield figuring she wouldnt need it again yknow where the elevation got higher Jesus Christ Not that she really knew how to use an ice axe anyway Her intent was to do only the California stretch not the entire trail though she did extend the trip through Oregon after she found out about the impassability of the trail another thing she should have checked on before she started walking So she motored through a good  miles of her hike and left the trail for various reasons at various points to hitchhike instead Thus she ended up with a lot of nonhiker people in a lot of nonhiking situations making this more a memoir of disjointed hippie travelbyanymeans than a memoir of HIKING THE EFFING PCT as all bookbuyers were led to believeThe parts of the book that actually DID take place on the Trail were interrupted by flashbacks to her life with her mother or the destruction of her marriage or her experimentation with heroin or the fallout from these events So much so as soon as she began actually talking about the Trail again I knew to brace myself for yet another forced emotional flashback to the ordinary tragedy of Strayeds typical American life Now in spite of the choking Mary Sueism of the authors selfdepiction I could forgive her utter dumbness in wandering onto the PCT unprepared if she actually learned anything about what a bad idea it is to wander into the wilderness unprepared If her unpreparedness for the PCT taught her how to be a better person more aware more focused more capable more responsible more honest about herself GREAT Bring on the stupidity I like a good redemption tale But it didnt It didnt If it did those passages were lost in editing or were never written at all The books big climax involves Strayed eating a peach in a grove of azaleas and its all very pretty and a deer walks into the clearing and she realizes thatview spoilerBut even thateven that I could forgive if the writing were good I will forgive anything for gorgeous writing My favorite book of all time is Lolita and I can forgive the existence of a fictional character like Humbert Humbert because damn have you ever read Lolita Strayed has at least once and apparently learned nothing about the value of lovely writing But the writing in Wild is if you will forgive the pun pedestrian at best I suppose its serviceable enough for a general memoir of an American woman having a typical American experience of loss and confusion and coming to accept her past But for describing nature Ugh I wasnt expecting Annie Dillard hefts a Kelty from this book but one would think that a book which alleges to focus on the great transforming power wilderness would at least give a little time or effort to you know wilderness Miles and miles of trail are dismissed in the tritest and most cliche of short sentences and as far as describing action Strayed often resorts to such apprentice work as we kissed and kissed and kissed I walked and walked and walked I cried and cried and cried I yawned and yawned and yawned I raged and raged and raged The most vivid scene of actual trail action I can recall is where she falls asleep beside a muddy tarn and wakes to the feel of frogs hopping all over her body The rest of the prose fell utterly flat particularly in scenes involving nature What a crashing disappointment And what a ripoff since readers are buying this book expecting to read about the experience of walking the PCT And there is virtually none of that hereIts no surprise to me that this book was selected for Oprahs Book Club  no less Oprahs selections have become over the years increasingly vapid and serving only the rahrah you go girl branding of the Club I remember long ago in a distant past when she actually chose books that had good writing and fascinating characters I should have been warned off by the fact that this book was picked but I wanted so so badly to read a wellwritten memoir about the enchantment of backpacking about the way the strife and the loneliness and the rawness of nature pull the packer into another realm of existence where life is fragile and valuable where the sky and the earth and the line of the trail itself live and by turns cradle and sustain the hiker and try and reject her Instead I got gee my feet hurt The great American memoir of the PCT still remains to be written Im sad that its not already here that I dont get to read it Im elated that maybe Ill yet have the chance to accomplish what this book didnt accomplish Maybe Ill get a chance to write it Im already planning my own trip from Mexico to Canada Not solo though Thats just dumb Who knowsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   "},

grow fonder because Harolds journey was testament to its truth A journey just as much about having the courage to reflect back as about going forward Solitude forces him to open the door to his personal demons Simply walking requires behavior thats totally out of character an ability to connect with both nature  mankind He draws the strength to keep going from his new found awareness of

definitely an overuse of put one foot in front of the other that verged on becoming a drinking game the premise of the story is lovely but it did get a bit schlocky and mitch albomy for my tastes mentions of both facebook and twitter in the book were curiousedited to add pasted in from my comment below in case people dont read the comments hereyou know the further i get from reading this book the more it is sitting with me in a way that is far deeper than i originally stated its an introspective story and deals with a lot of issues quietly  but i have been thinking about the story off and on for the last several days i think it would make for a really good inperson book club discussioni had the chance to meet joyce and hear her read and talk about the book shes a lovely woman and believes so strongly in harold that you cant help but wish the very best for both of themas far as the booker it would be very interesting if sheit won its not the typical book for booker  its a simple  sentimental story but its touching a chord with many many people that shouldnt sway the judges though its a tremendous achievement to have accomplished a longlist spot with a first novel amazing    I have just browsed through a bunch of reviews that are literally glowing with praise so I feel rather embarrassed that I cannot be more enthused about this novelI was really taken in by the premise and rather enjoyed the beginning of the book probably until celebrity hype and disciples befall HaroldFrom that point on I started to find the book predictable if not a little trite even I also think that while I have nothing against a good dose of pathos this may have bordered on the overdose I am very sorry I feel this way but I do but I do   Harold Fry has never done the unexpected having spent the last  years living a quiet sheltered life Retired for the last six months Harold shaves each morning and puts on a tie only to sit in the same chair with nowhere to go as his wife Maureen silently cleans One day he recieves a letter from an woman from his past who informs him she is dying Harold pens his reply only to be disappointed by his response so he makes a snap decision to walk across England from Kingsbridge to Berwick Upton Tweed to save herWith nothing but the clothes he is wearing and the small supplies he buys along the way Harold slowly makes his way across the country Along the way Harold will initially be critical of himself as he sees himself alone in the world thanks to uncertainty that he had all throughout his life from a young boy a father to David and then with a wife he no longer communicates with Its only when he begins going out of his comfort zone by talking to others along the way that he soon discovers the sad and beautiful truth that he is not alone and there are many people just like him that are struggling to put one foot infront of the otherBut for all the profound sorrow Harold encounters this is not a sad read Rather it suggest that new beginnings can always be found and it is never to late to do something extroidinary British playwright Rachel Joyces first novel is an endearing debut full of emotion I found myself riding all the emotions with Harold and was willing him on all the way At the heart of this is a story of a simple man a threadbare marriage and a fractured country All of this makes for an unforgettable and thoughtful story Do yourself a favour and take a walk with Harold a simple man who will get into your heart and leave you with a smile from ear to ear   "},

fighter McMurphy rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorship of Nurse Ratched He promotes gambling in the ward smuggles in wine and women and openly defies the rules at every

only his own indomitable will What happens when Nurse Ratched uses her ultimate weapon against McMurphy provides the storys shocking climax Last night at about  am I finished One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kesey I lay awake for a long time afterward watching the bars of light on the ceiling holding my eyes open until the pupils dilated enough to shrink the light then Id blink and have to start all overFinally I sat up and turned on the lights The book had done something to me Like itd punched me in the face and said Do something you idiotSo I gathered up a bunch of sentimental shit from around my apartment stuffed it into a backpack hiked across town and threw it off the Morrison BridgeThe backpack made a loud thunk when it hit the water Like a body falling from a building I watched it float downstream a tiny dot weaving through the rippling reflections of the city lights until it finally sank below the surfaceI tell you this story because in a way throwing that bag of stuff off the bridge is the best analysis I can make of Keseys bookSo much has been said before what else can I sayChuck Palahniuk summed it up nicely in the forward for the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition He explains that Cuckoos Nest tells the same story as the most popular novels of the last century it focuses on the modern paradox of trying to be human in the welloiled machine of a capitalist democracy where you must be either a savior or a slave Palahniuk points out that Cuckoos Nest shows us a third option You can create and live in a new systemnot rebelling against or carving into your culture but creating a vision of your own and working to make that option realIs there anything else left to sayReading this book is like being inside Fight Club You take punch after punch but keep crawling back for more because its making you feel things you didnt know you could feeland as long as you stay conscious and dont give up or let your eyes glaze over this book will creep into the very edges of your consciousness and give you new words for the questions you always wanted to ask show you how to draw a map of your own and give you a glimmer of hope that maybe just maybe it is possible to rise above the machine of society and become human again   My friend Ed was recently updating his books with reviews on here and this book popped up in my feed Its my husbands favorite moviebook of all time and I realized that I had never picked the book up Ive watched bits and pieces of the movie in the three thousand times that my husband has watched it but I had never experienced it first handIm guttedWhy have I not just sat down and watched the film that was made from this book Im completely off my rocker  Randle Patrick McMurphy That guy who plays crazy to get out of a work detail Goes into the mental hospital and completely owns it  He gets the inmates to smoking drinking having women and fishing He makes them back into the men that they wereI wanted to reach over and touch the place where he was tattooed to see if he was still alive Hes layin awful quiet I told myself I ought to touch him to see if hes still alive  The evil in this book Nurse Ratched I usually have a fond spot for the villains but this woman scares me She has got to be one of the top baddies of all time I still have goosebumps from her  Ive always been hit or miss on books that are called classics and thats probably why I have not tried some that now Im beginning to reconsider Because if they are like this one Im definitely missing out Thanks Ed for pointing out this most wonderful book to me   Hed shown us what a little bravado and courage could accomplish and we thought hed taught us how to use it     I have a lovehate relationship with this book The writing and imagery are superb and I always love a down with tyrannical overloads generic living and medicalization moral but its other lesson leaves me cringing In the basic knowledge I have of Ken Kesey the book ultimately seems very misogynistic and antifeminist Im all for a gender balance but this book botches up the entire process in a method that purposely lacks tongueincheek flair Basically the plot seems to involve men mentally castrated by a domineering woman who could just as easily be labeled Bitch as she could Big Nurse Enter main characterwho in my tattered yellowpaged s copy directly labels him as the hero of the book on the back covera man that pretty much shakes the men up to the supposed feminization of American culture and how its destroying their identities as males Read here a huge characterization of the male ego is to dominate the female with opposites all aroundHow is this man so easily labeled a hero Have we forgotten he has been charged and convicted among other things with rape of a female minor And the main reason hes in the asylum is to skimp out on his prison sentence How is that masculine if I am to continue on with the stereotypes the book itself perpetuatesand yet backpedals when necessary Why do we consider him the main character when the story is being told in the first person by a Native American Can you not be a mana herounless youre white Or perhaps it was because he was so docileIn the end the supposed hero of the book teaches men that to cast off impending feminization one must be violent towards women muscle them out of the way destroy them if theyre relentless If you are unable or fearful of doing so youre better off killing yourself than being only half of a man Oh but wait theres a special lesson for the ladies themselves too To steer clear of the eventual rape assault murder or tortureand yes it will happensimply sexualize yourself Thats the only way to be safe andisnt it convenientsecurely a woman So much for individualization and going against cultural norms gentlemen Youre a dime a dozenBefore we glorify such a book we have to sit down and figure out what exactly masculinity is outside of a cultural setting before we can complain that culture itself is taking it away Are we to allow a cowardly violent lookingoutforNumberOne individual give us this definition fair and balancedIts one thing for him to say it its another for us to listen   one flew east one flew westThis classic book gave birth to a movie which won a truckload of Academy Awards This means the majority of readers are familiar with one or the other and I thought a very brief review would be enough something along the lines The book is very good Seeing that some people miss the point of the story I had to ramble a little more than this short sentence sorry A ward of a mental hospital in Oregon was ruled by an iron hand of its head nurse Ratched She even had power over the doctor of the ward The patients were completely under her thumb until a rebellious guy called McMurphy was committed for the treatment He decided to challenge the nurses rule for completely selfish and notsoselfish reasons I mentioned the movie This is one of the rare and very precious occasions when the movie was as good as the book In case you have not seen it but like the book drop everything and do it now Those Oscars I mentioned in the beginning they are welldeserved I also believe Jack Nicholson was born to play McMurphy No actor in the world  dead or alive  could do a better job I really did not want to use the movie stills in my review as countless other people did it in theirs but I also thought it is impossible to talk about the book without mentioning the movie By the way I saw it before reading the book Later when I read it I realized I cannot put it down even though I knew what would happen next at any moment This should tell something about how good the book is Another points for the book I really hate stories told in present tense This time it took me about one quarter of the tale to realize this one was in present tense as well I simply had not noticed that before being busy literally living in Nurse Ratcheds ward When my mother got her hands on this one she was sure she would not like it being a doctor and as such familiar with goingson in psychiatry hospitals Several pages later I realized I had to wait for her to finish it to resume my own reading  her having an advantage of seniority and all Unlike the movie the book is told from Chief Bromden POV  this by the way made a nice surprise in the middle of the movie He is without a doubt mentally disturbed in the beginning and as such it is possible to see him as an unreliable narrator this would open a can of worms and a whole new level of speculation what if not everything he told really happened Aside from his obvious delusions that is I will not go there We now come to the main reason I decided to write a longish review the Nurse Ratched I heard two types of argument  She is a strong woman doing what she thinks is best and as such cannot be a villain thus McMurphy is the one If the Nurse is a villain how comes there is no other strong woman on a good side My answer for the first argument would be yes she is undoubtedly a strong woman Being a strong woman does not make one a good person by default The fact that she believes that everything she does is for the greater good makes her even scarier  and she is scary no doubt about itFor the second argument I can only say that there is no place for a good strong woman in the story We are talking about a male ward so she cannot be one of the patients She also cannot be one of the nurses as the head nurse surely would not let a strong woman into her domain she really does not want a competition So to have another strong woman only as a tribute to political correctness would be pointlessI will stop here TLDR too long did not read version of the review book  great read it movie  great see it     Really unpopular opinion coming your way Escape while you can How much of life is defined by choices and how much is determined by fate Or is really fate that directs lifes order or is it peoples thirst for power to remain strong Does the rabbit live in a hole because the wolf decided so What happens when the rabbit decides to challenge the wolfSuch thoughts are provoked by this widely read and loved classic novel The messages buried in an unexpected setting a mental institution revealing the grim aspects of such an institution striking metaphors and symbolism which I detected early on in the first part of the story the part I genuinely enjoyed Meeting Mc Murphy the rabbit that challenged the wolf felt like listening to the wisest philosophy teacher explaining juicy stuff about life with expertise wit and charm and reading the story in the perspective of Chief Bromden a patient feigning deafness made it even more interesting Its clear to me why several of my friends loved the novel Let me link you to their excellent reviews Partheeeys Ninas and Ate ShelbysUnfortunately the significant themes of the novel for me were overwhelmed by the strong sexist and racist undertones until the actual meanings of the story got lost behind the chauvinistic approach I found the story ironic because instead of feeling empowered by a woman character who is the boss at a mental institute where majority of population are males she is depicted as a controlling unreasonable and heartless freak with oversized chests in a matriarchal world where all the women are no good unless they provide sexual service It was very saddening and frustrating because I believe the author was driven by a conscious effort when he deliberately wroteinsinuated such messages in his novel The demoralizing climax added insult to injury and ultimately the reason I went for two stars It would have been just a star if not for the redeeming although really depressing conclusion answering the most important of the above questions In the battle between the rabbit and the wolf its the bird who fled for freedom that wins I should have just read Harry Potter     "},

moving although it is It isnt even so much that it is written with language that is both delicate and sturdy all at once which it is as well And its certainly not that Yann Martels vision filled passages are so precise that you begin to feel the salt water on your skin even though they are It is that like Bohjalian and Byatt and all of the great Houdinis of the literary world in the last few moments of your journey  after youve felt the emotions endured the moments of heartache yearned for the resolution of the characters struggle  that you realize the book is not what you thought it was The story transforms instantly and foreverAnd in those last few chapters you suddenly realize that the moral has changed as wellYou feel Martels words lingering suggesting and you find yourself wondering whether you are his atheist who takes the deathbed leap of faith  hoping for white light and love Or the agnostic who  in trying to stay true to his reasonable self explains the mysteries of life and death in only scientific terms lacking imagination to the end and essentially missing the better storyThere is no use in trying to provide a brief synopsis for this ravishing tale of a young boy from India left adrift in the Pacific in a lifeboat with a tiger who used to reside in his fathers zoo in Pondicherry There is no use because once you finish the book you might decide that this was not indeed what the book was about at all There is no use because depending on your philosophical bent the book will mean something very different to your best friend than it will to you There is no use because it is nearly impossible to describe what makes this book so grandRead this book Not because it is an exceptional piece of literary talent It is of course But there are many good authors and many good books While uncommon they are not endangered Read this book because in recent memory  aside from Jose Saramagos arresting Blindness  there have been no stories which make such grand statements with such few elements As Pi says in his story Life on a lifeboat isnt much of a life It is like an end game in chess a game with few pieces The elements couldnt be more simple nor the stakes higher It is the same with Martels undulating fable of a book about a boy in a boat with a tiger A simple story with potentially life altering consequences for its readers As Martel writes The world isnt just the way it is It is how we understand it no And in understanding something we bring something to it no Like Schroedingers cat in the box the way this book is understood the way it is perceived affects what it is There has been some talk that this book will make its readers believe in god I think its a question of perspective To behold this gem of a novel as an adventure of man against the elements the dry yeastless factuality of what actually happened is certainly one way to go about it But to understand this piece to be something indescribable something godlike is by far the greater leap of faithOh but worth the leap if the reader is like that atheist willing to see the better story   I found a lot of this book incredibly tedious I tend to avoid the winners of the Man  Booker  they make me a little depressed The only Carey I havent liked won the Booker Oscar and Lucinda I really didnt like the little bit of Vernon God Little I read and I never finished The Sea despite really liking Banvilles writing So being told a book is a winner of the Booker tends to be a mark against it from the start unfortunatelyIm going to have to assume you have read this book as if I dont I wont be able to say anything about it at all Apparently when Yann Martel wrote this he was feeling a bit down and this was his way of plucking himself up Well good on him Thats just great I was a little annoyed when I found out that the person the book is dedicated to had also written a story about a man in a boat with a wild cat and had considered suing for plagiarism The book is written by a member of that class of people who are my least favourite a religious person who cannot conceive of someone not being religious There is some fluff at the start in which atheism is discussed read discarded as something people inevitably give up on with their dying breath But the religious are generally terribly arrogant so it is best not to feel insulted by their endless insults  they know not what they doParts of this were so badly over written that it was almost enough to make me stop reading The bit where he is opening his first can of water is a case in point This takes so long and is so incidental to the story and written in such a cutesy way that I started to pray the boat would sink the tiger would get him  I would even have accepted God smiting him at this point as a valid plotting point even if or particularly because it would bring the story to an abrupt endThis is a book told as two possible stories of how a young man survives for  days floating across the Pacific Ocean told in  chapters That was the other thing that I found annoying  much is made of the fact this story is told in  chapters  but I could not feel any necessity for many of the chapters Just as I could not feel any necessity for the Italic voice that sounded like Tom Waits doing What is he building in there Well except to introduce us again to Pi some number of years later You know in Invisible Cities  Calvino has necessary chapters  this book just has  chapters It was something that annoyed me from early on in the book  that the chapters seemed far too arbitrary and pointing it out at the end just made me more irritated There may well be some Hindu reason for  chapters  but like Jesus ticking off the ancient prophecies on his way to martyrdom I still couldnt see why these chapters were needed in themselvesPi is the central character in the book who for some odd reason is named after a swimming pool  I started playing with the ideas of swimming pools and oceans in my head to see where that might lead but got bored He is an active practicing member of three of the worlds major religions There is a joke in the early part of the book about him possibly becoming Jewish ha ha  or perhaps I should draw a smiley face The only religion missing entirely from the book is Buddhism Well when I say entirely it is interesting that it is a Japanese ship that sinks and that the people Pi tells his story to are Japanese engineers Ive known Hindus who consider Buddhists to be little more than dirty filthy atheists  so perhaps that is one reason why these Japanese engineers are treated with such contempt at the end of the bookThe Japanese make the connections between the two stories  but we can assume that they stuff up these connections While it is clear the French Cook is the hyena Pis mum is the orangutang and the Asian gentleman is the zebra Im not convinced Pi is meant to be the tiger In fact the one constant thats a pun by the way you are supposed to be laughing in both stories in Pi My interpretation is that the tiger is actually God Angry jealous vicious hard to appease arbitrary and something that takes up lots of time when you have better things to do  sounds like God to meThe last little bit of the book has Pi asking which is the better story the one with animals or the one he tells with people I mean this is an unfair competition  he has spent chapter after chapter telling the animal story and only the last couple telling the people story The point of this though is Pascals wager said anew If we can never really know if there is no god and it ultimately makes no difference if we tell the story with him or without him in it but if the story is more beautiful with him in it  then why not just accept him in the story and be damnedWell because the story isnt improved with the animals and life isnt just a story and kids stories are great sometimes but I often like adult stories at least as much  and sometimes even more This is yet another person all alone survival story but one I dont feel that was handled as well as it could have been  mostly because the writer had an ideological message that he felt was more important than the story  never a good sign Worse still in the end I really couldnt care less about Pi  I knew he was going to survive and knew it would be because of his faith He does talk about Jesus most petulant moment with the fig tree  so I was quite impressed that rated a mention  but all the same I havent been converted to any or all of the world religions discussed in this bookCompare this tale with the bit out of A History of the World in Ten and a Half Chapters about the painting  I know it is not a fair comparison Barnes is a god but Ive made it anywayI didnt really enjoy this book I felt it tried too hard and didnt quite make it But Christians will love it  oh yeah  Christians will definitely love it   I was extremely surprised by this book Let me tell you why its a funny story On the Danish cover it says Pis Liv Pis Life but I hadnt noticed the apostrophe so I thought it said Pis Liv Piss Life and I thought that was an interesting title at least so perhaps I should give it a go So I did And what I read was not at all what I had expected I thought it was a book about a boy in the Indian slums or something It actually wasnt until I looked up the book in English I realized the title wasnt Piss Life I was deceived for the longest time and well not only about this When I first read it I also thought it was based on a true story Im not sure why I thought that I must have misread something I vaguely recall thinking the prologue was instead an introduction It was a sad and ehm slightly humiliating day when I discovered the truth lay elsewhere I guess your romantic beliefs must die someday and that was the day for meSee its easier to believe in the world and be optimistic about it when you also believe that world capable of containing a boy and a tiger coexisting on a lifeboat for  months and surviving The truth is this book probably changed my life not in any grand extraordinary way But with the small things the small observations Like how he was afraid to run out of paper to document his days in the lifeboat and instead he ran out of ink Like how he chose to embrace three religions not just one This book and Pi especially represent and embody a way of life that I admire Its not about believing in God but about what it takes to believe in something anything really Yourself the world goodness life God If it seemed real enough for me to believe it had happened perhaps the real world is indeed a place where it could happen And thats what I want to believe even if real life might tell me otherwise    Sift a pinch of psychology with a scant tablespoon of theology add one part  Island of the Blue Dolphin  with two parts philosophy mix with a pastry blender or the back of a fork until crumbly but not dry and there you have Pi and his lameo cheesed out boat ride to enlightenmentActually I liked the beginning of this book loved Pis decleration and renaming of himself his adding religions like daisys to a chain and was really diggin on the family as a whole and thenthen then then the tarpaulin I did learn some things though I learned thata cookies work wonders in assuaging heated argumentsb Tiger turds do NOT taste good no mater how hungry you are and hold absolutely no nutritional value actualy this might apply only to turds obtained from tigers that have been floating on rafts for several weeksmonths I think Ill apply it as a general ruleI wanted to like this book more  I loved the cover and then theres that little golden seal that keeps going psst psst you dont get it  its waaaay deep you missed the whole point But I think no I got the point like a  by  to the forehead I got the dang pointWhat I lack in spelling this author lacks in subtlty I felt like the ending was a study guidecliff notes pamphletwikepedia entry all in one I love Pi in the first rd I understand the merits of Pi in the raft just not my thing but pi in the last bit  ugh ughugh Im chocking on the authors shoving of moral down my throat  help help I cant breath stars for the beginning negative  stars for the ending add something or subtract to make it equal a positive   and there you have my  starred LIfe of Pi review   Life of Pi was a fairly engaging story in terms of plot and character but what made it such a memorable book for me at least was its thematic concerns Is it a story that will make you believe in God as Pi claims Im not sure Id go that far but I would recommend it to people who enjoy thinking about the nature of reality and the role of faith in our lives To me the entire thrust of the book is the idea that reality is a story and therefore we can choose our own story as the author himself puts it So if life is a story we have two basic choices we can limit ourselves only to what we can know for sure  that is to dry yeastless factuality  or we can choose the better story I suppose in Pis world the better story includes God but he doesnt say this is the only meaningful possibility In fact Pi calls atheists his brothers and sisters of a different faith because like Pi atheists go as far as the legs of reason will carry them  and then they leap Pis point in my opinion is that human experience always involves interpretation that our knowledge is necessarily limited that both religious belief and atheism require a leap of faith of one kind or another  after all theres so little we can know for sure For Pi then we shouldnt limit ourselves only to beliefs that can be proven empirically Instead we should make choices that bring meaning and richness to our lives we should exercise faith and strive for ideals whatever the object of our faith and whatever those ideals might be Or as Pi says in taking a shot at agnosticism To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation In the end however I didnt necessarily read this book as an invitation to believe in God Instead I saw it as a mirror held up to the reader a test to see what kind of worldview the reader holds That is as Pi himself says since it makes no factual difference to you and you cant prove the question either way which story do you prefer Which is the better story the story with the animals or the story without the animals Or as I took it Is it my nature to reach for and believe the better but less likely story Or do I tend to believe the more likely but less lovely story What view of reality do I generally hold Another equally important question is this How did I come by my view of reality Do I view the world primarily through the lens of reason Or do I view it through the lens of emotion For Pi I think its safe to say his belief comes by way of emotion He has as one reviewer noted a certain skepticism about reason in fact Pi calls it fools gold for the bright Pi also has what I would call a subtle but real basis for his belief in God namely an intellect confounded yet a trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose But belief still isnt easy for him Despite his trusting sense of purpose Pi acknowledges that Love is hard to believe ask any lover Life is hard to believe ask any scientist God is hard to believe ask any believer So its not that a life of faith is easier in Pis opinion its that for him belief is ultimately more worthwhile This is not to say however that Pi holds a thoroughly postmodern view of God or that he believes as a matter of art rather than in a sincere way True Pi suggests that whether you believe his story had a tiger in it is also a reflection of your ability to believe in something higher And of course its easy to read Pis entire story as an attempt to put an acceptable gloss on a horrific experience Still there are a number of clues throughout the book that give the reader at least some reason to believe Pis story did have a tiger in it for instance the floating banana and the meerkat bonesAs such Pis two stories could be seen as an acknowledgement that both atheism and belief in God require some faith and therefore its up to each of us to choose the way of life that makes us the happiest Hes not necessarily saying that the truth is what you make it hes saying we dont have unadulterated access to the truth our imagination personalities and experiences unavoidably influence the way we interact with the world But thats not the same as saying whatever we imagine is true I think Pi for instance knows which of his stories is true Its not Pi but the reader who is left with uncertainty and who therefore has to throw her hands up and say I dont know or else choose one story or the other And to me this isnt too far off from the predicament we all find ourselves in And thats what makes Life of Pi such a challenge to the reader Pis first story is fantastic wonderful but hard to believe Yet theres some evidence that it happened just the way he said it did And Pis second story is brutal terrible but much easier to accept as true Yet its not entirely plausible either and it leaves no room for the meerkat bones or Pis trusting sense of presence and ultimate purpose If the reader personally dismisses the tiger story out of hand I suppose thats another way of saying the reader by nature tends to believe the more likely but less lovely story In the same way if the reader gets to the storys payoff and still believes there was a tiger in the boat the reader is probably inclined to believe the more emotionally satisfying story But it should be born in mind that Pi doesnt definitively state which story was true something which only he can know for sure All we can really be sure of in Pis universe is that he was stuck on a lifeboat for a while before making it to shore So which story do I believe I struggled with that question for a long time But after thinking about it for a couple of days Ill end this review with the final lines from the book Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea as Mr Patel and none in the company of an adult Bengal Tiger

"text": "A mission to MarsSix days ago astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars Now hes sure hell be the first person to die thereAfter a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate the planet while thinking him dead Mark finds himself stranded on Mars surface completely alone with no way to signal Earth that hes alive And even if he could get word out his supplies would be gone years before a rescue could arriveChances are though Mark wont have time to starve to death The damaged machinery unforgiving environment or plainold human error are much more likely to kill him first But Marks not ready to quit Armed with nothing but his ingenuity and his engineering skillsand a gallows sense of humor that proves to be his greatest source of strengthhe embarks on a dogged quest to stay alive using his botany expertise to grow food and even hatching a mad plan to contact NASA back on EarthAs he overcomes one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next Mark begins to let himself believe he might make it off the planet aliveBut Mars has plenty of surprises in store for him yetGrounded in real presentday science from the first page to the last yet propelled by a brilliantly ingenious plot that surprises the reader again and again The Martian is a truly remarkable thriller an impossibletoputdown suspense novel that manages to read like a reallife survival tale Crap My astronaut crewmates accidentally left me behind on Mars Im fucked Im going to die Oh wait I just thought of something highly logically unlikely and technically complicated that I am sure to pull off without a hitch because did I mention that I am Plucky and Ingenious It sure is a good thing that I am supertalented Yay That worked Im not dead Next chapter But wait Disaster has struck Shit happens when youre stuck alone on Mars Whatever shall I do OMG I just had a great idea Its a good thing Im so naturally optimistic because it sure would make for a bummer book if I ever showed any signs of being depressed or having any kind of mental deterioration after spending nearly two years in total solitude Nah Ive got the fightin spirit I can create a life support system out of duct tape What does Mars actually look like Is there anything interesting from a scientific perspective about it Who cares Im busy growing potatoes in shit and watching Threes Company Did I mention that disco sucksRepeatFor a whileI do not get the hype   Unpopular opinion time I dont like how this book is written Watneys journals read like a nerdy blog rather than a dramatic survivors diary Its hard to find something harrowing and traumatic when the protagonist is saying yay a lot and making incessant corny puns  pirateninjas Yay oxygen Lol gay probe lol Bad rover no Scooby snack LOL craaaaaaap For me those arent funny theyre almost embarrassingNo matter what horrible thing is happening to Watney hes sure to pull though but not before laying a smug cutesy zinger on us It sucks all the tension out of any situation which is the complete opposite of what I want in a book thats supposed to be a thrillerNow dont get me wrong Andy Weir is a great technical writer When Watney isnt being a wacky douche hes going on and on about some technical or mechanical or biological process that with me not being a scientist usually goes over my head And thats fine I have no fault with a book thats factually complicated like that In fact its really admirable and cool that Weir is able to pool all of his expertise into a book about survival on Mars That being said other aspects of the book suffer According to the authors bio on the back of the book Andy Weir was first hired as a programmer for a national laboratory at age fifteen and has been working as a software engineer ever since He is also a lifelong space nerd and a devoted hobbyist of subjects like relativistic physics orbital mechanics and the history of manned spaceflight If I can stereotype here it shows My guess is that he doesnt really know how people behave or interact in the real world The dialog is stilted and awkward The characters are all onedimensional and flat They almost seem like an afterthought The emotional and psychological trauma rendered by all these neardeath experiences and complete and utter isolation What trauma Theres no mention of that anywhere Watney is apparently that cool and awesome of a guy as evidenced by all his canned laugh track oneliners and grating sarcasmBut hey maybe that doesnt bother some people obviously considering that people actually watch The Big Bang Theory and theyre in for a technologicallydriven funny spacethriller Because I have to admit its a terrifyingly cool premise It just wasnt what I was expecting I was hoping for an emotionallytaxing horrifying survival drama but instead got a cutesily witty astrophysics manual Just because something is nerdy doesnt automatically mean that its good   This book was fantastic A thrilling survival story with a hearty dose of humor The main character Mark was such a smartass and I LOVED IT The voice and the premise hooked me in right away and kept me thoroughly engaged the whole time My only real issues were that some of the minor characters didnt really stand out as much as they couldve and some of the science heavy bits were a little hard to follow and felt infodumpy at times But the human aspectthe heart of the storywas totally on point and for the most part I just had a great time reading thisOverall this book was exciting and fun and oh man am I excited for the movie I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes survival stories or funny thrillers or scifi with an emphasis on the sci   I have never wanted so badly for the characters in a book to be real I want to meet them all the way I want to meet the president or Taylor SwiftThis story is perfectly told It is perfectly paced it is brilliantly written it is beautifully craftedAndy Weir does this incredible thing where he make the reader feel the isolation that Mark Wagner feels and he does it so subtly we dont even realize that hes doing it until its doneThe Martian completely captivated me I couldnt wait to find out what happened next and I never wanted it to end   First off welcome to Lets kick this year off with a review of a book about a guy who deserves to survive more than anyone Ive ever known This book has been lurking around in my Goodreads feed gaining hype and all the positive reviews from my friends eventually got too much for me  so I had to check this out for myself Im glad I gave inThe Martian has so many good things going for it First and foremost it is a classic tale of survival against very huge odds In this book Mark Watney becomes one of the first people to walk on Mars but after an accident causes him to be believed dead and abandoned by his crew it looks like he will be the first person to die there Like Cast Away x a million Mark must battle extremely foreign territory the likelihood of starvation and the possibility of technical failuresIts pretty hard to see an outcome where he isnt totally screwedThe best thing about this book is the juxtaposition between the very scientific nature of everything Mark must do to survive  gave me a renewed level of respect for how damn smart astronauts have to be  and his absolutely wonderful personality Mark maintains his sense of humour throughout every hardship he faces  its pretty much impossible to not be charmed by himHere are some quotesThe screen went black before I was out of the airlock Turns out the L in LCD stands for Liquid I guess it either froze or boiled off Maybe Ill post a consumer review Brought product to surface of Mars It stopped working This book is part serious sciencefiction part an hilariously dark comedy that imagines a horrifying situation infused with humour and the overwhelming human desire to stay alive Its hard to imagine that anyone who picks this up wont find themselves dragged into Marks world desperately needing to know what will happen to himBlog  Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  Tumblr   "},

"text": "Richard Mayhew is a young man with a good heart and an ordinary life which is changed forever when he stops to help a girl he finds bleeding on a London sidewalk His small act of kindness propels him into a world he never dreamed existed There are people who fall through the cracks and Richard has become one of them And he must learn to survive in this city of shadows and darkness monsters and saints murderers and angels if he is ever to return to the London that he knewA fantastic story that is both the stuff of dreams and nightmares San Diego UnionTribune Neil Gaimans first solo novel has become a touchstone of urban fantasy and a perennial favorite of readers everywhere I didnt enjoy this book as much as I should have I kept distracting myself with the thought Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans books Then I would have to tell myself to shut up because Im reading one right now and I can return to berating myself laterNeil Gaiman really understands fantasy He understands that it isnt elves dancing in a forest and drunk dwarves mining for gold with improbably well maintained beards No fantasy is a reflection of reality but fantastic It isnt an alternate reality but reality through the lens of imagination and possibly some mind altering substances Not only does he capture the essence of fantasy perfectly but he does so with the trickiness and charming language that seems to be uniquely in the realm of British humorists He rarely describes anything in a completely straightforward manner instead choosing to almost fool the reader into visualizing his delightful or when appropriate very undelightful characters and events I couldnt help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into London Below right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans booksSo a few years later and a lot of people seem to like this review still Ive decided to abuse the popularity of this review to attempt to steer fans of Neverwhere towards a few other books that I think they will enjoy Despite the theme of the review being Read more Neil Gaiman the books listed below are actually by different authors since I think Ive already made it clear that you should read more Neil Gaiman So aside from all of those here are a few other recommendations Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart  An epic hilarious mythological adventureWool by Hugh Howey  A pretty dark and serious tale of people living underground on a ruined world The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson  A globetrotting adventure set among a lovingly researched historical backdrop  Little Brother by Cory Doctorow  A nerd finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly being stalked by his own government and doesnt think its so cool   Neverwhere was my first real introduction to the world of urban fantasy  a clever take on Alice in Wonderland one can say set in the semimagical unsubtly dangerous and quite fantastically warped world of London BelowNeverwhere is one of my alltime favorite books It has just the right amount of wild imagination inexplicably somehow still grounded in firm reality a healthy dose of absurdity and strangeness remarkably colorful largerthanlife characters unforgettable setting that is more of a character than a simple backdrop and of course sufficient amount of lovely dry humor Besides there is that certain something in Neil Gaimans writing that keeps bringing me back to his works  that cleverness I guess that boldness in his approach to writing that apt descriptiveness that burns scenes into your mind without becoming boringly detailed or repetitive and the bit of mesmerizing darkness he harbors in all of his works regardless of the theme or target audienceIn Neverwhere Gaiman uses the old technique of taking a person belonging to the regular world and throwing them into the midst of a fantastical reality using the protagonist as our eyes into this world  think of Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz or its younger siblings like Mivilles Un Lun DunRichard Mayhew is a timid and perfectly average London guy who suffers from a noticeable lack of figurative backbone  and the only time in his life he does show some of that illfated backbone combined with some very real compassion he gets himself into trouble that is waaaay over his head Let Richard tell you about it himself  Unwittinly having thwarted an assassination attempt on a young girl named Door and having helped her because lets face it hes basically a decent guy Richard suddenly finds himself in the London Below  a place for those who no longer belong to the regular London Above a place for those who have slipped through the cracks of ordinary reality It is a place that exists outside of our conventions of time and space touching our reality but not quite overlapping itJust like London Above London Below is a melting pot  except for this one is for relics and discards and misfits of all kinds of times and legends and beliefs and tales It is a place for those who fell between the cracks  think of those you usually do not notice even if you walk past them on the street like the homeless for instance they are already invisible to us It is also a place for those who spent too much time in the company of the supernatural and for those who dont fit in our world You can view it as a colorful tapestry  or more aptly as a dirty filthy rag made of mismatched and threadbare bits and pieces that once were something grand and even now create a mesmerizing albeit puzzling effect through their sheer strangeness and unexpected combinationAnd it is a place that has teeth and is ready to bite It is harsh and cruel full of menacing dangers lurking around every corner Friends can quickly turn into foes and promising a favor is a serious thing that can get you far in this world It takes skill to survive hereAnd Richard is very much NOT prepared for thatLondon Below is a place populated with creatures that have enough color and flair to them to easily stand out against the drab background of life and their surroundings Of course Im talking about Marquis here the notsohonest and yet brave and loyal for a reasonable price of a favor Marquis de Carabas the guy who you would ultimately want covering your back in a sticky situation as long as you can overlook the fact that he may have had something to do with creating the said sticky situation in the first place  With characters like Marquis or the enigmatic singleminded Hunter or pretty much anyone Richard comes in contact with in this weird mixture of rooftops and sewers and underground tunnels London Below is a confusing blur to Richards tired and overwhelmed senses Some things dont make sense Others make way too much sense are way too literal Earls Court or Knightsbridge for instance He is so out of place here its almost painful to read as you wince and cringe at his pathetic attempts to clutch to what he continues to view as safety and sanity And no this sanity does not normally involve girls named Door or a charming scoundrel Marquis de Carabas or Angel Islington or outwordly hired thugs Croup and Vandemar or Rat Speakers or Beast of London or the real Old Bailey or the nonexistent British Museum underground station where Earls Court can get you if you so please   But eventually Richard may just may start discovering something about himself that is a bit more adjusted in the world that has slipped through the cracks than real London In other words Richard Mayhew just may have gone native Unlike Dorothy and her Toto he may not want to just live happily ever after in his version of KansasAfter all havent we all at some point asked a question about what is the meaning of all that we are doing Havent we always wondered whether there ay be something else we may be better suited to be and do Havent we wanted to escape somewhere well else Different Isnt that some of the reasons we wan t to immerse ourselves into worlds of fantasy at least for a short while  Usually however the point is to return home enriched by experiences of the outwordliness and of course gain some appreciation for the life we used to take for granted before Because of course no matter how much we want to we will never escape the real life Or can we After reading this book I know I would want to had I been in Richards place But I cannot and so I appreciate my mundane uneventful life  but what if I didnt have to Who knows   I first started reading this book and honestly wanted to just chuck it in the bin I said very mean things about the protagonist under my breathSurely I said a Protagonist means that they are pro and totally into furthering the story Surely Protagonist is the similar to Proactive and ProductiveI was wrong The word Protagonist in its basic form is not similar to proactive It simply from the Greek plays means the principle character or the first speaking characterHowever I maintain that the kind of protagonist that most people want to read about is one that actually bloody does somethingHistoryLanguage lesson overNeverwhere is a book that TRIES to be clever and magical In many senses it utterly manages to be magical and creative and fun It fails however to be clever There are so many lines in this book intending to be dry wit and just come off dry stupid Allow an exampleThere are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr Coup and Mr Vandemar apart first Mr Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr Croup second Mr Croup has eyes of a faded china blue while Mr Vandemars eyes are brown third while Mr Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens Mr Croup has no obvious jewellery fourth Mr Croup likes words while Mr Vandemar is always hungry Also they look nothing at all alike Oh I see what you did there Kat laughs slapping her knee with her hand in amusement No not really If hed left out these lame little lines I think I probably would have enjoyed this novel a whole lot moreJust about every other character in this story is awesome except for the protagonist Give me a story about Marquis de Carabas and I will read it in a second Honestly fantastic character right there Tell me I have to read another whiny missive about Richard Mayhew and I will likely stick hot pokers into my eyes firstI get it I really do Its a journey He has to LEARN and GROW and CHANGE But he takes a REALLY long time to do it and he only ever grows to be slightly less pansy soft and annoying The total character growth comes to equal someone who doesnt just sit idly by and let people take stuff from himLet me give you an example He met a girl who was unconscious in the streets and bleeding to death He takes her home This causes his fiancee to break up with him He then goes through a lengthy process to get the girl back where she came from Once he does this he then loses his job his apartment and all his money He then goes to find the girl for a an explanation and b help Without her help he will probably die as another side effect of having met her is that he has two psychopathic killers on his tail She simply apologizes and walks away abandoning him So what does he do Does he chase her down and gently remind her that she owes him a favor Does he barter and trade what he can whilst trying to lure the killers into a trap so that he can some how defend himself No I will now transcribe from the book EXACTLY what he doesRichard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps echoing away and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping station of East London and the sewage works Shit he said And then to his surprise for the first time since his father died alone in the dark Richard Mayhew began to cry He decides to stay there and die Thats right folks He just stays there waiting to die BoofuckinghooYa know I dont accept this crap from a female character  nor do I accept it from a man How the hell am I suppose to sympathize with someone who so blithely lets everything he has slip through his fingers because he cant speak up and demand explanations or some kind of help This level of pitiful doesnt help the audience empathize  it makes them think your protagonist is an idiot The plot is pretty good  despite everything being painfully obvious and predictable at the end The world building is fantastic Its probably the best thing about this book Its really creative and fascinating and interestingOver all it was an alright read It wasnt great I labored through until the last half where it began to pick up and markedly improve Thus only three stars Had the first half been more like the last half then it would have earned four   Picture Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Really good books right Now imagine if someone took the first book and mad libbed characters settings monsters etc so that you were left with the exact same story except instead of travelling the galaxy with your crazy friend and the most powerful man in the universe you were travelling in haunted British sewers with a nerds wet dream of a Xena warrior princess rival and a Gothic princess who can unlock doors sigh I dont think there is much of a coincidence either because Gaiman wrote the Hitchhikers companion in the early s as well as conducted interviews with Adams while he was alive not to mention took writing tips from him The only saving grace for me with this book was the fact that there someone actually made a miniseries on the BBC of it that is actually so bad that it makes the book look half way decent Between all the cliche characters cheesy narration and formulaic plot its just not worth your money or a read especially when Hitch Hiker exists already Ive said it before stick to American Gods and The Sandman when it comes to Gaiman   There are two Londons Theres London Abovethats where you livedand then theres London Belowthe Undersideinhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world Now youre one of themWhat if there is a secret underworld hidden in the dark below the busy noisy streets of London What if Earls Court is truly the court of an earl and the name of Angel station derives from a real angel On a fortuitous night Richard Mayhew finds a mysterious young girl wounded in an alley and it is the first step on a journey to the world of NeverwhereNeil Gaiman is an author thats been on my list for a long time and I must say this was not anywhere near what I had expected His writing style is more flowery which translates to better in my head than I had feared and the premise and plot of at least this book was a lot less weird and more mainstream than I had thought As a whole that made me think of this as a somewhat remarkably wellwritten book with unremarkable characters storyline and settingAs an inhabitant of London albeit a temporary one this book of course came with an enormous appeal I decided I had to read it before I moved again and Im glad I did The fantastic fictionalisation of the Underground is both wonderful and enough to change my view of London The tube stations Earls Court Angel and many others now carry new meaningsIn the end Neverwhere is a very enjoyable but largely unimpressive book Not many people see this as a favourite among Gaimans works but its a good book that Id recommend to anyone who has been to London   "},

PROBLEM Pope Francesco I says Gentle souls why not When I first picked up this book decades ago I expected it to be another in a long line of highly entertaining Ludlum thrillers Four hours later I couldnt remember the last time I had laughed so much so consistently This is the second funniest book written by Ludlum top spot goes to its sequel The Road to Omaha It is completely out of character for Ludlum and yet somehow fits within his established styleFollowing the mad capers of General MacKenzie Hawkins who despite being Americas most revered and decorated soldier is now persona non grata perhaps having something to do with a series of events involving urinationa Chinese monument the top of the American embassy and brass balls the novel ups the crazy at every turn bringing a healthy dose of laughs with it The story is told primarily through the eyes of Samuel Devereaux hotshot lawyertobe who gets ensnared in Macs ridiculous plan to kidnap the pope Sam echoes every thought you might have as the reader sometimes stumbling for words just like you might You read every page to see if he can restore sanity to the plot and save the world but theres a bit of glee that comes with the realization that that will never happen because thats just no funThe book is a fun light read and sure to keep you entertained the entire time   This was fun I added another star for Brick the reader I swear he read this at times in an eerie but entirely apt imitation of Arlo Guthrie Jr doing Alices Restaurant No music or four part harmony but still It was fun  fit perfectly in with the tongueincheek storyThe Hawk was a great character as were they all A friend said it was a bit misogynistic but I didnt get that impression at all The Hawks women gorgeous exwives who still liked  respected him were definitely characters in their own rights  were shown through the appreciative eyes of the young lawyerThe twists were fun  audacious Pure entertainment Highly recommended in this format   I was cleaning out my basement the other day and found a pile of old Robert Ludlum books from the s and s Ludlum of course was the master of the thrillerconspiracyspy genre of those decades I picked up Road to Gondolfo and began reading it again after over  years of collecting dust and I couldnt put it down A typical Ludlumesque fastpaced thriller but also extraordinarily funny I had forgotten that Ludlum was equally renowned for his humour and wit as well as being the master of the spythriller genre I was laughing so hard I almost had tears in my eyesThe basic premise follows General MacKenzie Hawk is a living military legend a hero and a rogue Sam Devereaux is a bright young exHarvard lawyer now in the army and he cant wait to get out When the Hawk gets kicked out of the army for conduct unbecoming of an officer his options are limited  but not for long He has a plan a plan so ambitious it will shock the world and make him a very rich man He is going to get  million dollars  a dollar from every Catholic in the world And hes going to do it by kidnapping the Pope A great fast paced and humorous read  strongly recommened by yours trulyCheersFred   I am reviewing the thriller The Road To Gandolfo by Robert Ludlum which is a very good novel which I bought from a car boot sale Robert used to be the biggest selling author in the world and his books were so successful he didnt have to even write a novel every year He is an ex film producer and he tends what you might call intelligent thrillers This book is a little bit more light hearted than his usual stuff and in the introduction he says it was great fun to write This book was written in  when the Vietnam War was coming to a close This book is set in the near future at that time and the plot is their is a General who is being dishonorably discharged from the army Apparently he has shot the testicles off an important statue in China and although he admits he probably did do it he claims he was drugged and set up and didnt know what he was doing The Americans are in important negotiations for trade with China and dont want to upset them so decide he must go Apart from being a General he is a war hero who has served in every major American conflict starting with World War  The lawyer assigned to defend him is due to leave the army and the  become good friends despite the lawyer being involved in a previous case the General doesnt approve of They form a company to collect and sell religious artifacts Their search leads to a prominent member of the Catholic Church who served in Monaco during World War  and was staunchly anti Nazi despite pressure from those around him This story is a bit like Indiana Jones and they are determined to wreak revenge on the Chinese I did quite enjoy reading it and its around  pages so is a reasonable length    This book was first published in  and the authors name given as Michael Shepherd Turns out it was written by Robert Ludlum using a pseudonym at the mandate of his editorpublisher so as not to smirch his well known name It was reissued several times and the paperback I have is the  issue According to Ludlums introduction this arrangement gave him the freedom to unleash his staggering imaginationThe plot is way over the top and features an army general named MacKenzie Hawkins who concocts a scheme to kidnap the pope and hold him for ransom Ive read Ludlums novels in the past and enjoyed them notably the series about Jason Bourne but this book just doesnt compare In fact Im giving up on it after about eighty pages Its just too ridiculous and Im not able to take it seriously Im giving it the benefit of a doubt by rating it a generous three stars   "},

"text": "In the jungles of Vietnam Bob Lee Swagger was known as Bob the Nailer for his highscoring target rate at killing Today the master sniper lives in a trailer in the Arkansas mountains and just wants to be left alone But he knows too much about killing The mission is top secret Dangerous patriotic and rigged from the start One thing goes wrong doublecrossed Bob has come out alive Now he is on the run His only allies an FBI agent in disgrace and a beautiful woman His only hope find the elusive mastermind who set him up Multilayered with nonstop action this hotshot torcher of a thriller is addictive exciting and right on target A hightech highride reading experience I like this book There are things in it that bug me a bit but on the whole nothing that really requires commentBob Lee Swagger is a solitary man who lives alone in the Arkansas hills with his dog and his rifles He loves to shoot though he doesnt hunt for meat anymore as since the war hes lost his taste for the kill something Ive come to share Maybe its an age thing to Bob is part of the so called gun culture He reads gun books he loads his own ammunition and works at accuracy He keeps to himself since he was disabled out of the Marines Sergeant Swagger was known as Bob the Nailer He was one of the deadliest snipers in the theater of operations Now hes called back offered a job that someone knows he wont be able to turn down Only things arent what they seem Those whove contacted him are not what or who Bob has been led to believe and hes to be the fall guy Only the ones who plan to set him up dont know Bob Lee If youve seen the movie Shooter its based on this novel There are some a few fairly major differences For one thing the movie is set much later Bob Lee Swagger is a Vietnam Vet in the movie hes placed in a later era While there are fairly major differences in the book and movie I suspect anyone who likes one will like the other The liberties taken with the story arent used as so often happens to rewrite Bob Lee or any of the storys key points Enjoy both as sort of complimentary stories or possibly two similar stories where some of the characters happen to have the same names What can I say here Im a shooter and I suppose that shooters might be slightly more prone to like the book but I truly believe anyone who likes action novels will enjoy it While there are some details as to ballistic performance and some detail on the rifles themselves there isnt so much as to drive away those who arent aficionados Actually most of this touches directly on the plot Youll get to know Bob Lee as well as Nick and some others well including our villains but you wont be overwhelmed with information You wont come away knowing what Bobs favorite food is or if he has hangupsand Bob would look at you like you were from some other planet if you asked You will get to know what you need and in some of your cases youll have known people like Bob LeeThe story is fast moving slowing only slightly in a couple of places and it holds interest While there are a lot of action novels out there this one is moderately original Ive actually set out to find books like this once and while a few are close so far Ive not come up with any other than by this author that Id say are like it I suspect that readers will either like and identify with the protagonist of this one or not understand him much at all and not really like him Maybe nottry it and see I think youll like it if you like Vince Flynn Don Pendleton Harold Coyle Tom Clancy Larry Bond and others I call this an action novel it could also be called a thriller and will fit into either category Im not really fussed about pigeonholing it Whatever you call it its not dull I like this book I plan to put it on my shelf with my keepers and have already taken steps read reserved with one of my favorite book stores or ordered where I couldnt find one in town the next  books in the series about this character I recommend it  stars EnjoySince I wrote this I got all the Bob Lee books Note on Stephen Hunters booksI have reviewed several of his books and have liked some more than others I have a concern and Id like to put this out for what its worth The books are sort of a mixed bag There are two that I rated  stars but one I rated  and put on my favorites list That one is I Sniper which is book  in the Bob Lee Swagger series It occurs to me that if someone is less than thrilled with one of the books in the series before  they might never move on to that novelLet me suggest that even if you have been less than thrilled with one of the other books and have pulled away from the series you give I Sniper a try With lots of action a good cast and some great humor I think its so far the bestthough the jury is still out on Time To Hunt  as I skipped it and am about halfway throughso far its excellent   I had read the novel Hot Springs by Stephen Hunter several years ago and had been pleasantly suprised by the quality of the work And then about a year later I saw the movie Shooter starring Mark Wahlberg and once again came away pleasantly surprised I realized that the movie was based on the novel Point of Impact also by Stephen Hunter but beyond that I discovered the two were related in a unique way The main character in Hot Springs was Earl Swagger with at least three books in that series while the protagonist of Point of Impact is his son Bob Lee Swagger the lead character in a seperate series That mix got me interested in pursuing other novels in both series to discover what happened between the two seperate time framesIve got to tell youas much as I enjoyed the movie Shooter I was absolutely blown away no pun intended by the novel that it was based on This book is a major tour de force as they say combining the best elements of action histakes crime great settings and noble and slimy characters alike This is the first of the Bob Lee Swagger novels and what a character Trained by the marines to be the soldiers soldier and refined to be one of the best snipers in the world his past almost becomes a character in itself as he is forced to deal with events beyond his control This is a highenergy wellplotted story that isnt always headed where you think it is definitely one to keep you turning the pages into the wee hours of the morningIm so glad there are quite a few books left in this series and at least two more in Earls series as well for me to sink my teeth into   Before I start a review of this book theres two caveats that I should probably address The first is that I have a deep and abiding interest in guns and all the information that surrounds them which makes the information in this booklength of pull turned case necks all kinds of manufacturers and statistics that are too numerous to namea pleasure to read about rather than a chore Its not everyones cup of tea and I know and respect that But this is my own opinion and it was just the icing on the cake for what is already a very well written book The second caveat is that I already saw the movie which was loosely based on this novel called Shooter and starring Mark Wahlberg Having seen it I could at many times predict what was going to happen and had a more intimate knowledge of the charactersAnyway on to the good stuffI dont read a great deal of what youd call thriller novels One or two on occasion usually while Im on vacation In the past a great deal of Tom Clancy which I always feel inexplicably guilty for having read Dont ask me why But reading thrillers on the whole is something that leaves me feeling like my time could have been better spent as if there were novels with deeper plots better developed characters generally more complexity to themPoint of Impact however ignored all my feelings and went straight for the kind of themes I love and threw in some truly memorable characters along with plot twists that just kept catching me by surprise I read it in two days after I first picked it up and like any good book it would not let me go whether because I wanted desperately to know if one character or another was still alive or whether I viciously hated another and wanted to see the main characters bring him to justiceone way or anotherA lot of people give Bob Lee Swagger the main character of this book a bad rap for being who he is Sure hes a backcountry hermit who lives with his guns and devotes himself to them as one might a lover and to most that will make him irredeemably crazy But anyone who focuses on that is ignoring several important details not the least of which is the fact that the US Marines teach that kind of singleminded dedication to ones weapon and that Swagger has used this dedication to overcome vices such as drinking to excess To be sure his character is painted in broad strokes at times and when he lapses back into a Southern drawl for long periods where it seemed before that he hadnt had it before it can be a little hard to take with a straight face But hes not what youd call stereotypical He reads some of the famous nature writers like Emerson and Thoreau He writes and types because he enjoys it and has a gift for itthough many do not see it in him And he has a gift for hard work not just in terms of shooting but of planning along with the nearly inhuman patience required for the setup work of longrange shotsI wont detail the other characters too much but suffice to say that there are some that I adore and some that I loathe and while only a couple feel as real as Bob I think thats all the reader really needs The real centerpiece of the book is the plot in any caseWith conspiracies that run so deep and wide they make your head spin strategies and tactics that seem to defy the abilities of human reasoning and enough plot twists to keep you consistently on your toes Point of Impact is typical of the thriller genre But what makes it believable is the scale the plot isnt to end the world not to wipe out an entire country Its to kill one man and save the asses of a few people who by all rights should be in jail or on death row Given the world we live in today thats a lot more believable and makes the book seem a good deal more realistic and down to earth Apart from the rifles theres not much gadgetry either Even the bad guys are crammed into musty old trailers not much better off than the characters theyre huntingI wont say that this book is perfect Theres not a few points where I grew bored while I was reading particularly during FBI agent Nick Memphis long blocks of description Bob grew to caricature proportions on occasion and some of the feats that he accomplished were simply too big to be believable But if you manage to forgive these small mistakes youll find Point of Impact to be a rewarding book that will take you for a hell of a ride     stars Last half is good action suspenseFor the first  pages  I was depressed and stressed I had trouble sleeping at night It was too much hopeless helpless victim feel because innocent man Bob Lee was framed for murder and on the run THEN it changed and the rest of the book was exciting and hard to put down Bob Lee was on a mission of retribution  revenge The bad guys were worried There was a happy ending for the good guys which I liked But I did not like one thing at the end I did not understand why someone destroyed evidenceThere are a lot of technical details about rifles and guns Some readers will like that others wont I dont know anything about guns but it sounded good to me Someone compared Bob Lee to Jack Reacher The Bob Lee story was more realistic Reacher requires more suspending disbelief Also Reacher doesnt have the depressing and stressful effect that caused me to feel bad for a couple daysBob Lee Swagger was a top sniper in the Vietnam war This story begins twenty years later Bob lives with his dog in the Arkansas mountains The second herogood guy is Nick an FBI agent whose boss Howard cares about appearances instead of substance Howard is like systemic poisonDATANarrative mode rd person Story length  pages Swearing language strong including religious swear words but not often used Sexual language none to mild Number of sex scenes  briefly referred to Setting around  various US locations Copyright  Genre suspense thriller   Bobby Lee Swagger is a loner He likes things simple just him his dog and the cold silence of the north He also has a talentnot to sing or dance but to shoot and kill He was a sniper for Uncle Sam one of the best in the world But when the government comes calling and presses on Bobby Lees I love my country button he must heed the call But thanks to his daddys teachings and how Uncle Sam has treated Bobby in the past he takes no chances and takes steps to ensure that he is protected He has been asked to line up a shot at the President not to actually take him out you see just to see if it can be done So of course he does as he asks and tells them how when and where it can be done When an actual shot is fired and the President goes down the clock starts ticking on Bobbys life After all it was his gun his bullets and the shot that he himself lined out to the security detail so he must have done it Only Bobby Lee knew he hadnt committed the crime and was prepared to give his life in order to prove his innocence Along the way he manages to pick up a low level FBI agent and a pretty little nurse Not much of a team against the huge crushing weight of injustice But Bobby has an ace up his sleeve Now he just has to stay alive long enough to play itThe movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg was based on this book The book was better than the movie and ended differently    "},

"text": "A disturbing tape has made its way to British intelligence It contains battlefield chatter from an ambush in Afghanistan in which  US Army Rangers and a British medical team died Most of the Taliban voices are Afghan but the voice of the commander bears an Irish accent Sean Dillon is put in charge of hunting the traitor down Judas Gate by Jack Higgins is one of the dullest socalled action books I have read What began as an intriguing actionfilled series staring Sean Dillon has deteriorated into little more than a tale of tedious plotting endless talking and almost constant drinking among characters who have lost their individuality I wonder how the special unit headed by Ferguson can get anything right with all they drinking they do I also wonder how Shamrock the Irishborn villain can plot anything with his constant drinking Maybe its the Irish way according to Higgins if so it doesnt paint a very positive portrait of a warm and loving peopleThis is one is a disappointment mostly because the characters keep behaving in unrealistic ways without motivations that make any sense and because theres lots of crossover and confusion about whos who among the supposed good guysThe behavior is the worst part Supposedly very experienced spies reformed terrorists and special forces types blab about secret stuff tell people things they shouldnt and generally mouth off in such a way that the other side inevitably hears about it Then they discover theyve been discovered and walk blithely into danger anyway which no sensible person who has seen action would do and manage to overcome all odds to triumph over incredibly inept opposition This happens repeatedly and strains the readers willing suspension of disbeliefThe locations are meant to be glamourous but wind up being twodimensional cardboard backdrops and inserted not for any particularly believable reason but because action books clearly need to take place in glamourous locationsThe author relies on three recurring plot devices people whose business is guarding secrets discuss secrets in places where they are easily overheard people whose business is guarding secrets discuss secrets with people they ought not to trust secrets are divulged on deathbedsThere is no sense of urgency in what happens in the story We learn that a dying soldier had accidentally recorded an Irishspeaking commander of a Taliban unit in Afghanistan that had attacked and killed a dozen US Army Rangers and members of a British medical team in an ambush The chase is on of course to find that apparent traitor who calls himself Shamrock We also hear of a mysterious Preacher the Al Qaeda leader in London who somehow manages to remain safe as an academic despite his constantly using a cell phone to contact those he controls including Shamrock surely MI should have intercepted his calls especially with key word recognition programs Along the way we hear a lot about the Troubles and their aftermath in Ireland yet see little of the consequences of that often brutal and tragic period in Irish history We also hear about the fighting in Afghanistan but most of the action is off stage all we get is a lot of talking about it What was promoted as a revenge novel in which I imagined Sean Dillon would go off to Afghanistan and find and destroy Shamrockor bring him back to the U K for trialbecame a big disappointmentAnother major issue I have with the novel is the lack of character development through individual portraits I had to read the first two hundred pages twice to get any sense of each character They sound alike use similar phrasing and are little more than cardboard cutouts including the villain Shamrock as well as secondary characters Higgins introduces The principals such as Sean Dillon General Ferguson Daniel Holley and Harry Millerwho should stand out as being sharply etched imagessound alike with my eyes closed I could not tell them apart Even Harry and Billy Salter have lost their individuality as street thugs and are now little more than shallow images of themselves Indeed Billy used to be quicktempered muscle for Harry in this book he plays a minor role In fact he is even taken out of a critical mission at the end in the Khufra Marshes of Algeria by Ferguson Higgins after Billy was shot at near pointblankrange in the chest while saved by a chest protector he was deemed too weak to go after ShamrockWhat little action is there occurs sporadically and doesnt feel or sound believable We have an amazing shot by Dillon at dawn in a pouring rain offbalance and at some distance in misty marshes as he wounds Shamrock but even that is contrived We also have an attack on Ferguson in Pakistan which is also artificial That attack raises the question of why Ferguson would even go on such a mission he must be in his s by now and retired When he does appear Ferguson plays a minor role in what happens Even Roper the highly skilled communications expert and researcher employed by Ferguson is just another name we know nothing about how or why he is in the chair and how he manages to thrive on a few hours of sleep I also wonder how he manages to do his critical work with all the alcohol he drinks Many of the character details were introduced in previous books the reader who is new to Higgins needs some of the background details otherwise he will be completely lost in this novelHiggins also seems to have a problem with women He killed off Hannah Bernstein an effective member of Fergusons unit in an earlier novel Dillons lady friend Monica Starling is mentioned but only in passing being shipped off by Higgins to Harvard and Shamrocks mother becomes an avenging angel It is as though Higgins doesnt know what to with his women so he figuratively get rids of them As a cheat Higgins opens the door to a sequel with Shamrocks mother predictably telling Dillon after her sons funeral service that she is going to avenge her sons death This is the same device Higgins used with Kate Rashid in early adventures with Sean Dillon We know what will happen to Shamrocks motherFinally Higgins irritatingly uses a variation of and he did when a characters asks to be told about an event in the story Rarely do two characters ever share information directly And of course to make a character sound Irish we have several Old sods or Old soulsThe edginess of a taut thriller is is gone in Judas Gate I have read all of Jack Higgins work from when he wrote as Harry Patterson through James Graham to today the Judas Gate is the biggest disappointment so far I think it is time for Higgins to retire Sean Dillon as he did with Liam Devlin and bring in new blood as the driving force in action thrillers not merely part of more intellectual exercises   What can I say about The Judas Gate Large stretches of boredom interrupted by moments of hmmm time to open my eyes now Dillon returns with a major new character Daniel Holley who seems to have no real reason for existing I usually enjoy Jack Higgins books for treadmill reading but this one was a few steps below his usual work I almost wondered if it was written by a ghostwriter or coauthor as has happened with too many of Tom Clancys book ideas but no it appears to have been written solely by Higgins Disappointing   Higgins remains at the top of his form in this latest saga of Sean Dillon General Ferguson and company as they ferret out the latest of their public enemies when they discover an Irishman is apparently aiding and abetting the enemy in Afghanistan With only a recording of the voice as a British team is all but destroyed Dillon and team set out to locate and eliminate this threat to their country But the enemy has nothing left to lose and attacks from the shadows of anonymity Twice various members of the team are sent into ambushes  who will come back alive When the attacks become personal who will remain unscathed When the man is brought before them facetoface who will recognize him for who and what he really isThis is the seventythird title published by Higgins the eighteenth in the Dillon series Like most of his books this is military intrigue and is also somehow connected to the IrishEnglish problem that has reigned in those islands for centuries Mr Patterson Im a fan   The Judas Gate is right at the top of the list of the worst books Jack Higgins has ever writtenThe characters have lost all individuality the action somehow manages to be dull the plot developments are predictable and the settings in the book are all recycled from prior books asides for the brief introduction of a few scenes in PakistanAfghanistan Thats without going into the clichd writing recycled sequences  including the rehashed shot in the chest appear dead but oh no hes wearing a bulletproof vest or scene variety number two shot in the chest collapse then retaliate and kill the shooterIve read all  books before this one in the Sean Dillon series and can say without a doubt that the quality and plot development has been on a downward spiral for sometime and I shant be bothering to buy number If you are interested in his work check out The Eagle Has Landed The Eagle Has Flown  Sheba for decent novels   The Judas Gate well in my opinion it was a pretty good read There were some thrilling scenes throughout this book but a lot of it was just bad dialogue Shamrocks character could have been written much better than it was Jack Higgins surprisingly disappointed me with this book honestly if I hadnt had to complete it for a summer assignment I would have stopped dead center in the book Over all Sean Dillon came out as the star in the book helping get rid of the Muslim British terrorists that were constantly being recruited to help kill proud soldiers sadly In my opinion if you want to read this book go for it but dont have that high of hopes for it like you should with all of the other Jack Higgons books this drags on a lot and doesnt have a well thought out climactic moment which honestly just makes this book a bore   "},

but Samuel Beckett and Charles Dickens were hilarious Remember when the words on the page didnt just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity but actually made you laugh out loud Well thats the kind of humor that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimans  release Good Omens brims with and it is so damn goodThe two British authors were both relatively unknown at the time of their partnership having met when Gaiman working as a journalist at the time interviewed Pratchett on the success of his first major novel The Colour of Magic The two became quick friends and proceeded to write the  pages of the now cult classic novel by sending floppy disks through the mail and calling each other on the phone Of course that story is all explained in the appendix provided you dont pick up an original printing of the book if you do do that however you can probably sell it for quite a bit of change so dont be discouraged by your lack of author interviewsBut the real story at hand is of course the narrative of Good Omens itselfthe tale of two friends a demon named Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale who have spent all of human existence on earth and have rather come to like it so when it comes time for the Apocalypse they try to do whatever is in their powers to stop it The cast of costars can only described as vast with some characters only popping in long enough for Aziraphale to take over their body or to go on a shooting rampage The main other characters though include the Antichrist himself a young boy named Adam and his gang of friends a witchfinder named Newton Pulsifer and his love interest Anathema Device who just happens to be a witch and one whose ancestor Agnes Nutter was burned at the stake by Newtons greatgreatetc grandfather ThouShaltNotCommitAdultery PulsiferPerhaps youre beginning to pick up on that sense of humor I mentionedThats what makes this book so great Im sort of a sucker for religious humor and religious horror movies and Ive read a lot of books about the End Days This one has to rank near the top maybe even as the downright finest Its humor ranges from simple little comedic bits to social commentary on religion and the human racebut no matter how big or small the joke is every one of them is attended to equally and they are all funny because of that Though some of the British jokes and references flew by me a problem the authors usually account for in their humorous footnotes I really did enjoy this book all the way from the plot down to how it was written It really is an impressive feat for a coauthored book to feel so seemless this honestly almost puts shame to the excellent Stephen KingPeter Straub doubleups The Talisman and Black HouseSo let down your guard pack away that condescension that your professors poured into you Lit class after Lit class and resist the urge to turn up your nose at any novel you can buy in trade paperback form in airports for  but higher in Canadaoh wait not anymore I actually laughed out loud as I read Good Omens A few times to be completely honest And thats pretty impressive for a cynical jaded old bastard like me   I somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously So I couldnt help wonderingWhat Madam Bovary Might Have Thought Of Three days later a package arrived there was no return address but she immediately recognised Rodolphes hand It contained a paperback novel whose title was Good Omens Feverishly she cast herself over it Her English was poor but with the aid of a dictionary she persevered and soon made great progressThe more she read the greater her bewilderment became The book at first reminded her of Candide which she had surreptitiously read at the convent but M Voltaires sprit had been replaced by another ingredient she was unable to name she suspected that it must be the strange English invention they called humour All the personages were wellmeaning and agreeable the witches the torturers of witches the prostitutes even the Demons of Hell they were filled with kindness and compassion and their worst faults amounted to an occasional mild irritability Where were the indifference and thoughtless cruelty that surrounded her and which had now become the very air she breathed She did not know whether Rodolphe had sent her the book to comfort her or to mock her in her despair and her futile attempts to resolve this question gradually resulted in an agonising headache Her husband prescribed an infusion of valerian and persuaded her to retire for the night she lay sleepless in her bed a long time until the drug finally took effect just as the sky was beginning to lighten She dreamed of apocalyptic prophecies redheaded women wielding swords endless circles of horseless carriages young boys with dogsIn the morning she remembered that she should purchase some arsenicIt seemed unfair for this to be oneway So in the spirit of granting a right of reply heres What Good Omens Might Have Thought Of Madam BovaryI saw this smashin film yesterday on TV said Adam as the Them listened attentively It was called Madam BovverBoy She was a lady skinhead interrupted BrianNo stupid said Adam Its a French name BovverBoy By FlowBearYou mean Madame Bovary by Flaubert said Wensleydale I read about it in The Encyclopaedia of World LiteratureAdam gave him a withering glance Thats what I said he continued Madam BovverBoy by FlowBear Shes married to this doctor and hes dead borin so she starts hangin around with these two lovers and then she maxes out her credit card so she eats arsernick and poisons herself The bit where shes dyin of the arsernick is dead good Her tongues hanging out and shes screamin Why did she max out her credit card asked PepperShe was buying presents for her lovers said Adam Roses an boxes of chocolates an stuff like that I thought the lovers were supposed to give her presents said Brian dubiously My sisters boyfriend gave her this huge bunch of roses on Valentines Day and a box of Quality Street and a balloon with She gave them presents instead because it was a protofeminist novel explained Wensleydale authoritatively Thats what The Encyclopaedia of World Literature saysAdam felt that his control of the situation was slipping and decided to up the stakes Its all true he said in an exegetical move that would have had Flaubert scholars around the world clutching their foreheads Based on a true story he added prudently in case the The Encyclopaedia of World Literature happened to have opinions on the subject Behind the bushes Aziraphale raised an eyebrow Crowley looked defensive Very loosely based he whispered hastily I mean I tempted her its my job you know but Gustave changed the ending for dramatic purposes Said it didnt work to have Rodolphe sort out her debts and then settle down in a cozy mnage  quatre with her Lon and her husband I told him thats what actually happened but he insisted the arsenic worked better   In my personal hierarchy of books this one comes a close second after Bulgakovs The Master and Margarita What can I say  like diabolical father like infernal son In a way I can view this book as my own personal therapy session  that is in addition to it being a hilarious dryhumor take on Armageddon and the everdual nature of humanity its highs and lows and our ability to be both frequently almost at the same time As a kid I had a habit of getting into the books clearly not meant for my age  like for instance WARNING THERE WILL BE MILD SPOILERS BECAUSE I CANAs predicted by the titular th century witch Agnes Nutter in her extremely nice accurate book of prophecies handed down through centuries to her last living professional descendant Anathema Device Armageddon is quickly approaching The four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse have set out on their way and that must mean things are getting serious   And this upcoming major event is a source of some serious worry for eternalenemiesturnedreluctantfriends Aziraphale An angel and a parttime rare book dealer and Crowley An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards the duo who after six thousand years have gone native and would infinitely prefer this world to the future where either side wins  the future oh the horror without good music or bookshops or sushi restaurants And so the unlikely allies decide to band together to prevent the end of the world Except things do not go as plannedThe lovely images above can be seen here and hereYou see the young  Aptly named Adam he grows up  as his name suggests  perfectly human in a little corner of paradise  the English village of Lower Tadfield But Agnes Nutter is never wrong and as her prophesies suggest shortly after Adams eleventh birthday on which he DOES get a much wanted Hellhound Dog the events of the end of the world are set in their inevitable ineffable motion But Adams essential humanity puts a new spin on this old storyThe problem with the Antichrist Adam is that he a human elevenyearold boy is fueled  unexpectedly  by Love and righteous indignation He loves this world and he coming into his power wants a very human thing  he wants to make it better Dont we all But do and can his good intentions make any difference in the way things have been prophesied to goIf there is one thing this book gets through its the belief in humanity Not in its wickedness or goodness or anything like that Just humanity in all the multifaceted nature of it in its righteousness and wretchedness love and cruelty strengths and weaknesses stupidity and wisdom Sometimes maybe when left to our own devices when not preached to in one way or another we can perhaps develop into flawed but hopefully decent beings  like Adam named after the first human in the prophetic fashion after all Because what makes life interesting as a particular angel and demon would loudly attest to is precisely the combination of good and evil nice and nasty mean and kind that we all possess in the precarious and miraculous balance that is the true treasure of humanity Because it makes us act like peopleAnd maybe just maybe due to our alwaysbalancing nature on the borderline between two conflicting universes that we humans inhabit we will be able to eventually figure it out  without anyone messing with our heads filling them with the Good or the Evil endlessly preaching what they believe to be true  but simple letting us be ourselves Maybe we will figure things out on our ownThe brilliant PratchettGaiman duo provides everything these two authors are famous for  easy readability dry intelligent sarcasminfused humor seamless plot that pushes the limits of imagination while staying perfectly grounded in albeit fantastical reality and first and foremost very apt observations about human nature as well as in a true Pratchettlike way a complete irreverence for the setinstone beliefs and ideas At times its easy for those familiar with their respective styles to tell which one of them penned which part at times its impossible  but it doesnt matter as their writing styles blend together so well so seamlessly so seemingly effortlesslyThis is an excellent book  both funny and serious at times utterly unpredictable at times baffling at times logical Its a pleasure to read and a pleasure to seriously reflect upon after having a good laugh And for all of that it gets the ineffable five stars  June  I just listened to this one on audiobook  AGAIN I love it more and more with each time I do I have to advise  if you plan to listen to this one please get the British version with Stephen Briggs as the narrator Isis Publishing  it is lightyears better than Harper Audio Stephen Briggs is amazing   Overall this book was a huge disappointment for me Id heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years When I finally started it I was about  pages into it and thought Yes This is going to be one of the most entertaining books Ive ever read It was like reading The Hitchhikers Guide for the first time again It was witty and fastpaced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion And then about halfway through I realized that I just wasnt really laughing as much anymore The story seemed to get bogged down with characters that werent that interesting for me to read about and who I often found a bit annoying Most notably the yearold Antichrist and his friends seemed really out of place in the book They felt like they would have been at home in a Norman Rockwell painting or British equivalenta ragtag bunch of kids with slingshots and backyard adventures I think that I was supposed to find them and their inane conversations entertaining maybe even a little bit cute but every time they came around which felt like quite a bit I thought that the book just screeched to a haltMost of the other characters in the book were great fun to readthe demon and the angel and their strange sort of friendship was easily the best part of the book for me The four horsemen of the apocalypse were also a lot of fun at least most of the time Overall the premise was brilliant What a disappointment for me that it just couldnt keep it together throughout The ending seemed contrived and the resolution was just unsatisfying for me I know that so many people loved this book I wish that I could have enjoyed it as much as they did    This has got to be one of the funniest satires Ive ever read I suppose the closest comparison I could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to Dogma but filtered through a distinctly British lense That description doesnt really do the story justice but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book The whole premise and Im not giving much away here begins with the accidental misplacement of the infant Antichrist during a complex babyswapping procedure intended to kick off the Apocalypse Its all down hill from there  This book is funny irreverent and at times surprisingly insightful While some parts of the book may seem cliched or even kitschy the book never puts up the pretense of being revolutionary or edgy The characters like any melodrama are intended to be archetypal so even the relatively predictable changes that occur seem appropriate in the context of the story The surprises are really in the details and in that regard the execution is brilliant To give you an example the devil Crowly drives a car in which the tapedeck will transform any tape placed in it into a copy of Queens Greatest Hits within a very short period of time after one hits the play button Now I love Bohemian Rhapsody as much as the next guy but an eternity of nothing but THAT particular album Thats the kind of devilry that works on many levels   "},
{"title": "The Forest Unseen A Years Watch in Nature",
"isbn": "067002337X",
"author": "David George Haskell",
"text": "A biologist reveals the secret world hidden in a single square meter of forest In this wholly original book biologist David Haskell uses a onesquaremeter patch of oldgrowth Tennessee forest as a window onto the entire natural world Visiting it almost daily for one year to trace natures path through the seasons he brings the forest and its inhabitants to vivid lifeEach of this books short chapters begins with a simple observation a salamander scuttling across the leaf litter the first blossom of spring wildflowers From these Haskell spins a brilliant web of biology and ecology explaining the science that binds together the tiniest microbes and the largest mammals and describing the ecosystems that have cycled for thousands  sometimes millions  of years Each visit to the forest presents a nature story in miniature as Haskell elegantly teases out the intricate relationships that order the creatures and plants that call it homeWritten with remarkable grace and empathy The Forest Unseen is a grand tour of nature in all its profundity Haskell is a perfect guide into the world that exists beneath our feet and beyond our backyards Letter I wrote to the authorIve just finished reading The Forest Unseen I have slowly savored your book over many weeks reading one days entry at most two at one sitting I have never read anyone who combined a meditative consciousness with a scientists mind so beautifully You presented the theme of the interconnectedness of all things so delightfully in so many amazing forms birds eggs vultures lichen and the roothairfungus relationship all come easily to mind as examplesLong ago I learned to walk in the woods without a goal I live in western North Carolina and for many years lived on a gravel road surrounded by national forests I carved my own hiking trails to special placesa rock outcropping a particular tree a springhead flowing over a small rock cliffand would walk to those places and then sit and observeNow I live in Asheville in a mountain cove with a lawn that is mostly Prunella vulgaris Four or five afternoons a week I work at home I spend time in a little patch of this lawn with my cat sitting and observing the ants spiders and other creatures crawling over the vegetation Youve inspired me to see this suburban patch as my own mandala and look even close than beforeYouve created a book that I know I will enjoy reading many times in my life I already plan on having my husband read this aloud to me so we can savor it together   The premise of this most excellent natural history of a forest is that the author stakes out a small circle in the woods say about  feet across in a tiny tiny but one of the only left sigh old growth forest remnant in eastern tennessee He goes out everyday for a year and just sits there observing the plants and animals Of course that is a bit of a simplification as he discussed things like the lifecycle of salamanders and butterflies and migrating tufted titmice and deer and hickory trees etc etc so one would not actually see much of what he describes but he does a good job balancing the scientific with the folksy and the philosophical and the unknown Because frankly we dont really know a whole hell of a lot about the ecosystems we live in and many of these are disappearing as we pave for strip malls and kill for golf courses etc the text is not mucked up with footnotes or too much high science but there is a very nice contextual bibliography if reader is interested in more hardcore reading But this is a good example of nat hist porn yummy yummyHere is a small excerpt from chapter entitled December rdLitterI lie facedown at the edge of the mandala the circle he has been observing all year and really is my only gripe in the book I hate that word bigot readying myself for a dive under the surface of the leaf litter The red oak leaf below my nose is crisp protected from fungi and bacteria by the drying sun and wind Like the other leaves on the litters surface this oak leaf will remain intact for nearly a year finally crumbling in the next summers rains These surface leaves form a crust that both hides and makes possible the drama below Protected under the shield of superficial leaves the rest of autumns castoffs are pulverized in the wet dark world of the litter Yearly the ground heaves like a breathing belly swelling in a rapid inhalation in October then sinking as the life force is suffused into the forests bodyBelow the red oak leaf other leaves are moist and matted I tease away a wet sandwich of three maple and hickory leaves Waves of odor roll out of the opening first the sharp musty smell of decomposition and then the rounded pleasant odor of fresh mushrooms The smells are edged with a richer earthy background the mark of healthy soil These sensations are the closet I can come to seeing the microbial community in the soil The light receptors and lenses in my eyes are too large to resolve the photons bouncing off bacteria protozoa and many fungi but my nose can detect molecules that waft out of the microscopic world giving me a peek through my blindnessA peek is about all that anyone is given Of the billion microbes that live in the half handful of soil that I have exposed only one percent can be cultivated and studied in the lab The interdependencies among the other ninetynine percent are so tight and our ignorance about how to mimic or replicate these bonds is so deep that the microbes die if isolated from the whole The soils microbial community is therefore a grand mystery with most of its inhabitants living unnamed and unknown to humanityAs we chisel away at the edges of this mystery jewels fall out of the eroding block of ignoranceThe forest unseen a years watch in nature by David HaskellA very well written natural history of old growth hardwood forest Naturalist Haskell observes one small patch in the forest for a year and describes the life and rhythms of reptiles flowers trees birds microorganisms insects mammals fungi and the history of the forest in the USA how it has changed and how it has stayed wild Written for all audiences this is very informative and entertaining poetical even The book has a very nice bibliography but unfortunately no maps or pictures   Well Im clearly in the vast minority here but Im just not enjoying this book enough to push through and finish it There have been a couple of chapters that Ive found pretty interesting but theyve been few and far between and at times Ive found myself feeling pretty skeptical about what hes describing for instance the entire chapter where he decides to take all of his clothes off in the middle of winter to see what animals feel in the cold and it somehow doesnt occur to him until the very end of the chapter that duh most of the animals that live in the woods have fur and feathers that help keep them warm in addition to other bodily processes we dont have That made him seem either kind of stupid or like he thinks Im kind of stupid Either way it annoyed me I dont know maybe Im being a jerk about this but I really like the idea of this book and was hoping it would focus a little more on the science side of nature and a little less on thepoetry side Or something Anyway its just not working for me    I should have loved The Forest Unseen Forests delight me and Ive also spent time sitting in them and simply watching There are many thoughts and opinions that Haskell and I share Unfortunately this book just bored me Maybe its my own fault because I tried to read it through like I would any novel instead of savoring it bitebybite as other readers did But I think there may be a legitimate reason The writingIt was sloppy Poetic but sloppy And the poetic descriptions werent even that good Oftentimes Haskells decision to opt for a metaphor or some elaborate description left me confused When he simply discussed the forest and its occupants I liked the book well enough The chapter about turkey vultures for example was particularly fascinating Did you know turkey vulture guts can kill anthrax But too often it was simply comically overwritten Dont believe me Lets look at the chapter for March th accompanied by my thoughts as I read itThe mandala is a molluskan Serengeti Herds of coiled grazers move across the open savanna of lichens and mossUh whats happening Coiled mollusks Maybe hes talking about miniature forest shrimps or something glances at chapter title which yes it was my fault for missing  Snails Oh snails Alright Snails move in herds Thats new to me And theyre not coiled are they I mean their SHELLS are coiled but their bodies arent Unless Im confused Help I didnt know I was so misinformed about snails Or maybe he just means Many snails crawl across the mandate Well go with that for nowThe largest snails travel alone plying the crazy angled surfaces of the leaf litter leaving the mossy hillsides for the nimble youngstersSo  only baby snails travel in herds And adult snails prefer leaf litter to moss Why Tell me moreI lie down on my belly and creep up on a large snail that sits at the edge of the mandala I lift the hand lens to my eye and shuffle closerDont get distracted Haskell Baby snails travel in herds Im not done with that yetThrough the lens the snails head fills my field of vision  a magnificent sculpture of black glass Patches of silver decorate the shining skin and small grooves run across and down the animals backSowere not talking about snails herdlike behavior anymore They DONT move in herdsMy movements cause mild alarm the snail withdraws its tentacles and hunches back into the shell I hold my breath and the snail relaxes Two small whiskers poke their way out of the chin waving in the air before reaching down and touching the rock These rubbery feelers move like fingers reading Braille touching lightly skimming meaning from the sandstone scriptAre these tentacles and whiskers the same things or different Nice Braille simile thoughSeveral minutes later a second pair of tentacles launches out from the crown of the snails headBack to tentacles again So tentacles and whiskers are the same Got itThey reach upward each with a milky eye at its tip and wave at the tree canopy aboveYou know if this second pair of tentacles or whiskers are the eye stalks I still dont know what the first pair was for Maybe he really did mean whiskers My own eye bulges at the snail through the lens but this monstrous globe seems to be of little concern to the snail which extends its eyestalks farther These fleshy flagpoles now reach wider than the shell and swing wildly from side to sideFleshy flagpoles Yes we all learned about alliteration in high school But even alliterative this metaphor is still silly INSERT SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS DISCUSSING SNAIL SIGHT WHICH WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THEYRE INTERESTING AND IM ENGROSSED FORGETTING THE ORIGINAL SNAIL THEN IT COMESWait WHAT The snails head EXPLODED How Why Is this like how slugs are supposed to melt when you pour salt on them And what was this snail doing anyway I forget goes back several paragraphs So the snail was crawling then it went in its shell It came back out waved its eyes around and now its head exploded CrazyThe black dome is split by a knot of cloudy flesh The knot pushes out forward then the snail turns to face meI thought the snails head exploded It doesnt have a face anymoreThe tentacles form an X radiating away from the bubbling doughy protrusion at the centerIm really not following Is the doughy protrusion the same as the fleshy knot Why is it bubbling Are these explosion remnants Center of WHATTwo glassy lips push out defining a vertical slit and the whole apparatus heaves downward pressing the lips to the groundgiggles at yonic imagery But Im not proud of itI watch saucereyed as the snail starts to glide over the rock levitating across a sea of lichen Tiny beating hairs and ripples of infinitesimally small muscles propel the ebony grazer on its pathAlright now Im just getting irritated by your inconsistent and mixed metaphors First the mandala was a savanna now its a sea But the snail is still a grazer Shouldnt it be a swooping seabird sarcasm Whatever Cant you just tell me why young snails move in herds and why this snail explodedFrom my prone position I see the snail pause amid lichen flakes and black fungus spiking from the surface of oak leaves I peek over the lens and suddenly it is all gone The change of scale is a wrench into a different world the fungus is invisible the snail is a valueless detail in a world dominated by bigger things looks at book suspiciously Waithas all this head exploding stuff been what I think I suspect it might have Oh cmonMy snail vigil ends when the sun breaks out from behind a cloud The mornings soft humidity has lifted and the snail heads toward El Capitan or a smallish rock depending on how you see the worldWell to hell with this You mean all that exploding head bubbling flesh description was really just describing how the snail moves I  I just cant WHY CANT YOU JUST SAY THAT THE SNAIL CRAWLED ACROSS LICHEN And yeah I get it you exaggerated for effect to demonstrate how dramatic smallscale actions can appear when magnified But I still have no idea what happened What was the snails head actually doing that it looked like it exploded What was the fleshy knob that came out of a black dome Was the dome the head or the shell How is the snail moving CANT YOU JUST TELL ME ABOUT SNAILSAnd that was this book for me a constant struggle to decipher meaning amid a barrage of misguided tedious metaphor It choked what otherwise could have been a delightful narrative Too bad   This book made me mad Not because it wasnt extremely good  it was  its because I wanted to write this book at least I did in my s That said Im sure I would never had done it as well as David George Haskell hasThe concept of the book is simple Haskell takes a very small area I believe a square meter in the mountains of Tennessee and watches it very closely through a full calendar year with the eye of a highly trained biologist and ecologist then tells us what he sees The result is a few dozen short essays on a particular aspect notable during whatever season hes writing in and follows it through with exceptionally well explained and not always a given in nature writing  cough cough Bill Bryson scientifically accurate illustrations of the remarkable world taking place within above and around that square meter of forestThe concept is not particularly new Aldo Leopold may not have invented it but surely perfected it with his classic A Sand County Almanac What Haskell leaves behind in Leopolds easy narrative tone he makes up for in his ecological precision and insight Even the places where a cliche is expected and to some degree it usually arrives Haskell is on top of his game enough to make even the cliched metaphors and extrapolations to the broader world both fresher and more nuanced than one would get from a lesser observerNotably Haskell takes a very dangerous step past the pure science of his observations and his recordings of his subjective experience into the spiritual and the poetic calling his square meter of observation a mandala after the Buddhist meditative sand paintings Yes I rolled my eyes at its first usage and yes Haskell at points carries his metaphors just a halfstep too far but it is truly surprising that the excess is never more than that halfstep And in a way this is perhaps the most honest form of nature writing possible in the Tennessee mountains Anyone familiar with the forests of the southern Appalachians can attest to the ability of their intensity their rugged beauty and at times their harshness to bring out a bit of the poet in even the most hardened skeptic Whereas the average nature writer often falls prey to one of the twin temptations of either presenting the concepts from a safely rationalized distance or of galumphing into excessive poetic outbursts Haskell presents his thoughts and experiences with appropriate modesty and candor For instance in the late fall as the leafless canopy lets in the most light in months he tells us that the lift on his spirits takes him by surprise and then goes on to talk about the human need for light very briefly but then turns directly to the groundtied herbaceous species taking advantageA passage near the end illustrates the balance Haskell achieves Scientific models and metaphors of machines are helpful but too limited They cannot tell us all that we need to know What lies beyond the theories we impose on nature This year I have tried to put down scientific tools and to listen to come to nature without a hypothesis without a scheme for data extraction without a lesson plan to convey answers to students without machines and probes I have glimpsed how rich science is but simultaneously how limited the scope and in spirit It is unfortunate that the practice of listening generally has no place in the formal training of students In this absence science needlessly fails We are poorer for this and possibly more hurtfulAnd there in exactly the space where lesser writers would have either extolled the great virtues of scientific knowledge or railed against the cold equations of mathematical ecology Haskell rightfully lifts up the in his case rather considerable scientific insights that can illuminate his mandala but doesnt shirk its shortcomings A simple concept Clearly not terribly novel since I was trying to do it a dozen some odd years ago and tried many times by students of ecology and of Leopold However in Haskells hands we get something far more worthy of celebration  a work that I have no hesitation in calling a new classic of American nature writing   "},

that still may be in effect today Now for the first time an acclaimed journalist with unprecedented access to key sources in the intelligence and military communities reveals suppressed evidence that tells the story of a quest for a discovery that could prove as powerful as the atomic bombThe Hunt for Zero Point explores the scientific speculation that zero point energya limitless source of potential power that may hold the key to defying and thereby controlling gravityexists in the universe and can be replicated The pressure to be the first nation to harness gravity is immense as it means having the ability to build military planes of unlimited speed and range along with the most deadly weaponry the world has ever seen The ideal shape for a gravitydefying vehicle happens to be a perfect disk making antigravity tests a possible explanation for numerous UFO sightings during the past fifty yearsDrawn from interviews with those involved int the research and visits to labs in Europe and the United States The Hunt for Zero Point is a captivating account of the twentieth centurys most puzzling unexplained phenomenon Good read Try great read This is another page turner Nick Cooks indefatigable search for buried science after WWII would read like a spy thriller if you didnt know he used to be a top editor at Janes Defense Weekly He is highly credible and I can vouch for that professionally which some reviewers have questioned No wonder given the subject matter Bottom line This is a guy who doesnt make stuff up Anyway you couldnt make this stuff up if you tried

is nonfiction In the vein of All the Presidents Men you worry about Nick Cook just as much as you yearn for the truth to come to lightI wasnt able to put this book down It was that exciting The research is so well documented the facts are so solid Amy Gerber and I referred to it constantly during the making of our Cold War documentary MY GRANDFATHER WAS A NAZI SCIENTIST Opa von Braun and Operation Paperclip Ive had The Hunt for Zero Point on my top shelf ever since   Amazing read i was expecting a little kookiness but this book had none of that There is most definatily a hidden technology breakthrough and failure to disclose it is keeping the whole of humanity from a paradigm shift The fall of gravity like the fall of reilgion has the potential to set mankind free of its socialpolitical chainsAlso discussed heavily in this book is the German militaryindustrial complex and how the SS started controlling arms  tech development the way they structured their top secret security and how America and it aerospace industry adopted the same techniques to keep black projects under wraps I had known how much we had walked away with from Germany tech wise like Vs and such but I was stunned to learn the details of such an operation as it was enacted The book could use some flow charts and other visual data organization showing overlaps in developments and a general timeliine better maps also This can only serve to help more see the undeniable connections made in pursuit of this technologyThe upcoming film Iron Sky picks up where Kammler left off in Germany or more appropriately vanished turning the storyline into more of a comic book adventure Should be a good film but should not be allowed to distract the populace from the real truth behind the tale Kammler so freaking mysterious enigmatic might be one of the most important figures of last century with only a few knowing his nameMore books like this one are needed to show the world what is really going on It is so often rumored that the Nazi and SS were into occult projects Its easy to see how labs in hidden mountain caves emitting strange glows with levitating objects  mysterious effects could easily have been distorted    If there is a book to give a newcomer to the subjects of antigravity technology and secret science then this would have to be the one Its a very well written account of one mans search for information and the truth about these fascinating ideas The author is a reputable aviation journalist in his own right which means the book is well researched and presented His search takes him from the present day back to those secretive events surrounding the snatching of German scientists and technologies immediately after the German surrender in World War Two and tries to connect the dots within the postwar US and Soviet military industrial complexes to unravel the secrets of antigravity machine development and other associated technologies I found the stories from the world of Nazi science totally engrossing with so many intriguing ideas and personalities all driven by various motivations I get the impression that we may be just beginning to discover the wonders from this dark time in Germanys history and if one can look past the fanaticism of the Nazi regime and in particular Himmlers occultdriven SS who ended up controlling most of the technology you can see so much evidence of scientific and technical brilliance A topnotch book and the best overview of this amazing topic that Ive read so far I highly recommend it   This book was quite a surprise as it is written in the style of a story I would classify it as a sort of military detective story that is both thoroughly engrossing and entertaining I would thoroughly recommend it for any fans of conspiracy theory in particular those who are interested in antigravity drives The suggestion is that the technology is available now but suppressed or in use only in deep black projects I particularly liked the fact that according to Bill Gunston OBE the stealth bomber does not have enough thrust or lift from its engine spec to lift its  pound weight of the ground It uses

"text": "When America entered World War II in  we faced an enemy that had banned and burned over  million books and caused fearful citizens to hide or destroy many more Outraged librarians launched a campaign to send free books to American troops andgathered  million hardcover donations In  the War Department and the publishing industry stepped in with an extraordinary program million small lightweight paperbacks for troops to carry in their pockets and their rucksacks in every theater of war  Comprising  different titles of every imaginable type these paperbacks were beloved by the troops and are still fondly remembered today Soldiers read them while waiting to land at Normandy in hellish trenches in the midst of battles in the Pacific in field hospitals and on long bombing flightsThey wrote to the authors many of whom responded to every letterThey helped rescue The Great Gatsby from obscurityThey made Betty Smith author of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn into a national icon When Books Went to War is an inspiring story for history buffs and book lovers alike This was the most bookish book Ive ever seen on World War II And because of its extreme bookishness it also managed to be the most heartwarming nonfiction book about that war Ive read There just arent a lot of heartwarming books about Nazis Not sure whyAnyway the author set out to chronicle how books helped American soldiers serving overseas Librarians organized massive donations of books to send to soldiers but eventually the Armed Services started printing their own editions of lightweight paperbacks ASEs which were read often and frequently shared According to the author one of the most popular books was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith which I read when I was a kid and am now excited to rereadI listened to this on audio and it was one inspiring story after another about how books helped the soldiers Sure there were upsetting references to the Nazis burning books but overall this was a highly enjoyable story of the power of the written word Preach on sisterFavorite QuotesIf it had not been for the mountains of books that were sent to the training camps and overseas units during the war many men may never have developed an interest in reading studying or returning to school Librarians felt dutybound to try to stop Hitler from succeeding in his war of ideas against the United States They had no intention of purging their shelves or watching their books burn and they were not going to wait until war was declared to take actionThey werent just for entrainment and diversion Books also served as the premier weapon in fighting Adolf Hitlers war of ideas Nazi Germany sought control over peoples beliefs not just their bodies and territory From the  statesanctioned book burnings in Germany to the purging of libraries across Europe as nations were conquered by the Nazis unGerman reading material was threatened with extinction The scale of destruction was impressive By VE Day it is estimated that Germany had destroyed over  million books in Europe It is no exaggeration to say that the ASEs helped create an entire new cohort of readers The flip side of a new universe of readers however is that almost everyone thinks he can be a writer Ironically council publishers were soon besieged with book proposals as countless men expressed a desire to publish their war storiesUnder Roosevelts plan higher education would be doled out irrespective of social class or wealth for the first time in American history This democratization of education for veterans was a fitting conclusion to a war fought in the name of democracy and freedom    In a slice of history thats hard to imagine could be repeated today When Books Went to War tells the story of a program that delivered millions of books to Americans in the military overseas during World War II For some reason this story has been all over place recently in an article in Atlantic magazine in a book about The Great Gatsby by Maureen Corrigan So We Read On and now here It was no secret but I never heard of the program until a few months agoIts a fascinating history and Molly Guptill Manning does it justice The book is short under two hundred pages but it covers a lot of territory It touches on the effects the books themselves had on the troops as well as the boost to the popularity of paperbacks during and after the war By providing over a thousand titles to those at war a generation of readers was created and many went on to go to college through the GI Bill while others simply kept the habit of reading for pleasureIn addition to the wartime program of providing small cheap paperbacks to the military another program after the war provided translations of American works to civilians in countries where few books had been published since before the war This was a huge opportunity for American propaganda and influence which Manning glosses over but is dealt with in more detail in John Henchs Books as WeaponsWhen Books Went to War is the best kind of history book  wellresearched informative and hard to put down   More books were given to the American armed services than Hitler destroyed That just about sums up the goals of the American government in creating and publishing the ASE Armed Services Editions for distribution to American servicemen in WWII Remembered fondly by veterans it provided free small easily transportable paperback books for servicemen to fit in their pockets to be read whenever they needed the escape books provided For book lovers this is an informative account of how reading literally saved the sanity of hundreds of thousands of soldiers during the war    I vividly remember the American Service Edition of W H Hudsons Green Mansions that was among my parents books with its distinctive shapethe width about double in size from the height its double columns of type and its floppy cover I suspect that my father brought this book back from his Army service in World War II A draftee from the Chicago slums he exemplified the person for whom these books were distributed by the US Army and Navy Thrown together with draftees from places as remote as rural Georgia and officers from Nashvilles upper classes and sent to North Africa Sicily Germany and the Netherlands he found his war experiences terrifying boring and fascinating Always a reader his access to the surprisingly wide variety of newlycreated paperbacks supplied by American librarians publishers and government officials must have stimulated and comforted him as it appears to have done for many other soldiers After five years of military service my father returned home and took advantage of the GI Bill to go to college and earn a PhD in American Literature Though he was married and working at the same time he found going to school with other veterans who were as serious about learning as he was one of the most exciting periods of his life His rise to middleclass status and his later career as a professor novelist and author of several scholarly books was directly linked to his military service particularly to the GI Bill and possibly even to the ASE paperbooks with which he had been supplied This book is a paean to the farsighted and broadminded librarians publishers and government officials who wanted to supply soldiers with a solitary form of comfort and distraction on the battlefield regardless of how remote that battlefield might be In an era when conscription drew fairly democratically from all social classes in the US the reading material given to the soldiers was similarly broad in scope and point of view The GI Bill capitalized on those democratic impulses and made it possible for many people who could never before have afforded to go to college to join the middle class Like so many other aspects of American democracy this one seems very remote from todays world    As a professed bibliophile I was intrigued when I learned of the publication of When Books Went to War by Molly Guptill Manning The concept of the book was fascinating and it seemed to me that the topic the impact of reading on American military personnel during World War II has never been given much attention Now with Mannings monograph we have a short history of the role of books during the Second World War ranging from Nazi book burnings the ideological war between Nazism and Democracy the diversion provided to American soldiers that allowed them to endure and the impact on the publishing industry that led to the production of the mass market paperback Manning has written a wonderful book as she integrates her theme in relation to the important events that took place during the warAccording to Manning there was no escape from the fear of dying during World War II Whether on land sea or in the air American GIs faced the likelihood that they or someone very close to them would not survive Any diversion from the anxiety that soldiers faced on an everyday basis was welcomed As Manning describes it the days were grinding the stress was suffocating and the dreams of home were often fleeting Any distraction from the horrors of war was cherished The men treasured mementos from home Letters from loved ones were rare prizes Card games puzzles music and the occasional sports game helped pass the hours waiting for action or sleep to come Yet mail could be frustratingly irregularsometimes taking as long as four or five months to arriveand games and the energy to play them could not always be mustered after a long day of training or fighting To keep morale from sinking there needed to be readily available entertainment to provide some relief from war xiiixiv The answer that evolved was the creation of book editions designed for soldiers portable and accessible for those in combat rehabilitation or other wartime situationsManning begins her narrative with a Nazi book burning rally on May   The purpose of the rally organized by Adolf Hitlers Minister of Public Enlightenment Joseph Goebbles was to ensure the purity of German literature and rid Germany of ideas antagonistic to German progress  The works of Sigmund Freud Emile Ludwig Thomas Mann Erich Maria Remarque among many others were tossed into the fire no longer available to German students Thousands of book burnings took place nationwide including major universities It is estimated that the Nazis burned over  million books during their reign of terror This set the stage for an aspect of the war that was apart from the battlefield as Hitler fought to eliminate democracy and free thought The American Library Association ALA described Nazi actions against intellectual freedom as a bibliocaust their weapon of choice was to encourage Americans to read and once the United States became an active belligerent supply books to American soldiersManning reviews the history of how America organized the distribution of books to American soldiers Beginning with conscription and the military training that followed the ALA and other organizations were created to gather and distribute books to American GIs At first the effort was based on collecting donations from the public at large but when that was deemed inadequate because of the increasing number of men in the military the fact that hardcover books which had been the staple of the American publishing industry before the war were much too heavy to be taken into combat also the supply of books was being exhausted and finally many books that were donated did not meet the needs of the troops The Victory Book Campaign VBC which had been in charge of book donations turned to the American publishing industry to solve the problem as one company Pocket Books had already begun publishing paperbacks The magazine industry had developed miniature editions for servicemen and they were very successful so why not the book industryThe key for infantry soldiers and those near the front was to travel as light as possible and at the same time meet the needs of soldiers who craved reading to make the noncombat time go quickly Manning provides details how the paperback volume evolved and how it caused a revolution in American publishing Publishers joined together to create the Armed Services Edition ASEs of hundreds of titles under the auspices of the Council of Books in Wartime Problems did develop in the production and distribution of these volumes but once these problems were solved millions of books came off the presses and were distributed overseas and to military facilities at home One of the more interesting insights that Manning provides centers on unpopular books before the war that would emerge as best sellers later on F Scott Fitzgeralds The Great Gatsby and Betty Smiths A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are cases in point The impact of these books on soldiers was profound Manning includes numerous letters written by GIs during the war extolling the virtues of the books they read and the need they filled GIs were interviewed after the war and expressed similar feelingsAs men waited on Landing Craft in the English Channel for the D Day landing many turned to books AJ Liebling a war correspondent for New Yorker magazine wrote that one infantry man told him these little books are a great thing They take you away  Many soldiers developed a relationship with the authors they read Katherine Anne Porters Short Stories touched the hearts of many soldiers and she received over  letters Betty Smith the author of A Tree grows in Brooklyn received  letters a year and answered each one As one private wrote Books are often the sole means of escape for GIsI havent seen many a man who never before had the patience or inclination to read a book pick up one of the Councils and become absorbed and ask for more  In fact many soldiers would become lifelong readers because of their experiences during the war Manning deftly captures the emotions that soldiers felt as they identified with the literature they read It brought them home and gave them hope for the future and helped them deal with the present Manning must have scoured many sources to come up with the letters she integrates into the narrative and it provides tremendous insight for the reader into the minds of the soldiers who fought The program to supply books did provoke some controversy particularly as the  Presidential election approached Senator Robert Taft amended the Soldier Voting Act which created a partisan battle over the ballots that soldiers would use Tafts amendment titled Article V stated no book could be sent to soldiers funded by government funds that containeded political argument or political propaganda of any kind designed or calculated to affect the result of any election  The Council responsible for choosing titles and the War Department afraid to run afoul of the legislation trimmed the approved list and books such as Charles Beards The Republic Catherine Drinker Bowens Yankee from Olympus and EB Whites One Mans Meat along textbooks for military education courses were no longer available The Council led the opposition arguing that books available in the United States now were not available overseas for American soldiers Manning characterizes the conflict as nothing more than a Republican attempt to hold down Roosevelts vote since  of GIs polled said they would vote for a fourth term Whether accurate or not Manning presents both sides of the argument as Republicans were forced to amend the legislation ostensibly overturning Article VOnce the war ended there was an obvious correlation between the success of the Council on Books in Wartime and postwar developments Under the GI Bill of Rights veterans were allowed a free college education Eventually  million veterans took advantage of this opportunity and many did so because of the reading habits they developed during the war For those who were not avid readers before the war the Victory Book Campaign was responsible for showing men they could thrive at book learning and studying after the war After all if they could read and learn burrowed in a foxhole between shell bursts surely they could handle a course of study in the classroom Further the American publishing industry continued publishing paperbacks revolutionizing the industry Numerous publishers began producing paperbacks and sales went from  million in  to  million in  and by  hardback sales were overtaken by those of paperbacks changes directly related to the ASEs of the war Molly Manning has examined a different aspect of World War II and its influence on post war America Her thoughtful approach and reasoned analysis has produced a wonderful story that needed to be told It is a reflection of American values and deserves to be read by a wide audience   "},

"text": "Randall Munroe left NASA in  to start up his hugely popular site XKCD a web comic of romance sarcasm math and language which offers a witty take on the world of science and geeks It now has  to a million page hits daily Every now and then Munroe would get emails asking him to arbitrate a science debate My friend and I were arguing about what would happen if a bullet got struck by lightning and we agreed that you should resolve it     He liked these questions so much that he started up What If If your cells suddenly lost the power to divide how long would you survive How dangerous is it really to be in a swimming pool in a thunderstorm If we hooked turbines to people exercising in gyms how much power could we produce What if everyone only had one soulmateWhen if ever did the sun go down on the British empire  How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and liveWhat would happen if the moon went awayIn pursuit of answers Munroe runs computer simulations pores over stacks of declassified military research memos solves differential equations and consults with nuclear reactor operators His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity studded with memorable cartoons and infographics They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind or at least a really big explosion Far more than a book for geeks WHAT IF Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much the smarter for having read Ive been a reader of XKCD for ages Not just a reader a fan A big goey geeky fan So much of a fan that when I heard about this book I went so far as to abuse my power as an author to get an Advance Reading Copy of the book so that I could enjoy its deliciousness sooner And yknow taunt people on the internet And it worked I got an early copy And I treasured it I petted it It was precious to me Precious Then life got in the way Conventions Promotion for my own book launch I had dad stuff to do I had prep work for the yearly  Worldbuilders fundraiser Then I had my book tour Through all of this I carried my precious ARC around waiting for the time when Id be able to spare the brainpower to read it I even took it on tour with me Honestly this book has more frequent flier miles than any three of you put togetherIt wasnt until I got back home that I started it I wanted something to read before I went to bed and I picked What If because I was worried if I picked up another book Id be reading half the night and it would screw up my already dysfunctional sleep schedule Despite my best intentions I read half the book that night It cost me precious sleep I couldnt afford to lose But I dont regret it Not a bit Its clever but if you know anything about Randall Munroe that wont come as a surprise to you And its funny and witty which are two different things by the way But again to readers of XKCD this wont come as any sort of surprise The surprise was how easy it was to read Theres some decent science in there but it wasnt anywhere nearly as braintaxing as Id expected Munroe does a brilliant job of explaining very complex concepts simply Thats a rare gift The other surprise is how much it pulled me in I expected to read the book in dribs and drabs over a couple weeks Instead I tore through it Thats not usually the case for me with nonfiction books In brief its worth your time Even if you havent read his comic Even if you havent ever heard of Randall Munroe Even if youre not into science You should pick this up and read it Youll be glad you did    Q What would happen if every geek in the world received a copy of A Actually less than youd thinkFirst a little background about this book If youre a geek its unputdownable a word that if you think carefully means cannot be put down You may not be aware of this fact since the word is nearly always misused So the geek who receives it is going to carry on reading through breakfast through lunch while hes supposed to be working and on through dinner ignoring the nongeek guests who have come to visit Hell interrupt conversations every now and then to ask things like Could you build a bridge across the Atlantic out of Lego bricks or How close would you need to be to a supernova to be killed by the neutrino flux Hell finish just as the last guest leavesThere is a common myth most likely spread by geeks that what they do is somehow pretty important to Western civilization If youre easily impressed by this kind of propaganda you might expect that markets will crash as geek traders neglect their buy signals nuclear experiments will explode as geek scientists look away from their control panels and terrorists will strike with impunity as geek intelligence analysts fail to turn up for work All that sounds pretty badBut lets stop and consider for a moment Is any of the above geek behavior novel or unpredictable Hardly Geeks are always doing this kind of thing and society has learned to work around them Important as they may be in the long run theres always some dependable nongeek person ready to step in just in case the geek in question has stayed up all night playing Halo or watching a Star Wars marathon The nongeek will cover for them until the geek has got over their fifteen hour internet speedchess session and is ready to do whatever it is theyre actually being paid to doSo delivering a copy of What If to every geek in the world will only really have two important effects It will make a great many geeks very happy and assuming of course that the copies are paid for it will turn Randall Munroe into a billionaireAnd who could possibly have anything against that   This book opens with the best disclaimer I have ever seenDo not try any of this at home The author of this book is an Internet cartoonist not a health or safety expert He likes it when things catch fire or explode which means he does not have your best interests in mind The publisher and the author disclaim responsibility for any adverse effects resulting directly or indirectly from information contained in this bookThat disclaimer really sets the tone for this fun book about science Dangerous ideas ahead folks Dont get too close  these things could kill yaRandall Munroe used to work at NASA and now he creates the webcomic XKCD which sounds less stressful than the NASA gig On his website he takes absurd hypothetical questions from readers and tries to answer some of them Here are some of my favorite questions in this bookIf you are interested to know any of the answers to those questions this book is for you What made this so much fun aside from the ridiculous questions is Munroes sense of humor Several times I laughed out loud at his drawings and his answers which is not something that usually happens when Im reading about science Oh and be sure to read his footnotes which have even more jokesI think this book would be a great gift for kids who love to ask crazy questions about how the world works I think I would have loved it when I was  I need to thank my GR friend Brendon for pointing out this marvelous book because I had never heard of the author before Its the miracle of Goodreads    One of the things thats nice about goodreads is that it lets you embed pictures And one of the nice things about xkcd is that it has lots of pictures licensed under CC AttributionNonCommerical  meaning I can post as many as I want to this reviewIm pretty sure that if youre here you already know about xkcd But hey why the heck not Right XKCD is why this Randall Munroe character is famousThe book comes from his what if blog which is also very goodI took the book into work with me to show it around  you know  hipsteresque and what not Im reading this trendy new book firstBut the guys at my table were all like Yeah I can see myself reading like  or  of these and then putting the book down Everyone more or less nodded in agreement  even though they thought the book was coolThen I looked at the book a little bit more closely flipped through a little bit and thought Huh that sounds about right Thats probably what Im going to doIll add that one guy in my group really hate hypothetical questions This is mostly because kids in arguments try to prove points by using them stupidly You know But what if Hitler hadnt killed the Jews Would you like him then or What if Martin Luther King Jr had used violence You have to admit its pretty crazy that weve given this guy a holiday right He has a pointSo I took the book home  slightly shamed that I hadnt realized it was more for coffee tables than actual readingBut then I picked it up and read a couple And a couple more Next thing I know a couple of days later the book is done  and I really enjoyed it And I learned a lot Well presumablyI did come on here hoping that some of the reviews would challenge Munroes math Or any of his conclusions I mean if I did on a couple of these there are bound to be some flame wars in the comments sections of these review right If I could take issue with a couple I am NOT a math guyIn case there arent any flame wars yet let me start one On page  in answer to the question If everyone on the planet stayed away from each other for a couple of weeks wouldnt the common cold be wiped out he says The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses but rhinoviruses are the most common culprit These viruses take over the cells in your nose and throat and use them to produce more viruses After a few days your immune system notices and destroys it but not before you infect on average one other person Then he has a footnote which reads Mathematically this must be true If the average were less than one the virus would die out If it were more than one eventually everyone would have a cold all the time But that cant be right Can it Its tough to tell whether hes serious or not because sometimes the footnotes are jokes and other times theyre notBut here it made me question the math of the rest of the book Hes very meticulous in his calculations throughout but here he doesnt factor in seasons or how vast the globe is Wouldnt it make more sense that when we have the virus we average more than one infection  and then people stay away from us  and are more cautious in general  which is why the number goes back down but doesnt die out completelyIt took me a while to get over this undermining the whole book for a couple seconds Seriously if he had just said but not before you infect on average on other person I wouldnt have thought twice about itOf course I doubted him on other footnotes pg  Although itsa little different if you drip superglue on cotton thread it will catch fire That cant be right can it Thats another of his jokes RightMunroe also interspersed Weird and worrying questions from the what if inbox Honestly most of these werent any weirder than the questions he was already answering And sometimes I think they only seemed weird but I think he may have missed the trailLike on page  the question is What is the probability that if I am stabbed by a knife in my torso that it wont hit anything vital and Ill liveTheres a stick figure that says Asking for a friend former friend I meanBut I think its a legitimate question And Im pretty sure it comes from the movie SCREAM  wasnt it a major plot point So Thomas the person who asked the question wherever you are  I dont think youre a weirdo Yeah yeah yeah spoiler alert if youre reading this in  Although Id be willing to wager if anyone can travel through time its Munroe Hes sure studying that stuff And Einstein And Schrodinger Also probably J Robert Oppenheimer And the book is so dated He mentions the newfangled writing section of the SAT on page  That was dropped way back in   Time travelling  am I rightFinally Munroe  if youre reading this  and I know you are just take the plunge and watch Dragon Ball Z already You may hate it but dont knock it till youve tried it rightSeriously  loved the book Thought I would like it didnt think I would love it Didnt think I would read it the whole way through  finished it in under  daysAlso shouldnt this go under like a scifi shelf Since the questions are hypothetical Isnt this exactly what sciencefiction is Its just not told in narrative form in this case   ChangeOrg Petition Despicable MunroeThe International Astronomical Union recently named an asteroid after Randall Munroe asteroid  Munroe is big enough to cause a mass extinction if it ever hits EarthNot that he needs an asteroid to do that He has his minions devising millions of ways to do it on a subversive site they call xkcdcom This book is a set of leaked manuals It should be clear to all how dangerous this guy and his site really is But all Government agencies fail to heed my warnings I exhort you to read this and then contact your local representative immediately We can stop him Together If you still have doubts let me remind you of numerous disaster movies  there is always only ONE GUY who saw it coming Do you really want to ignore meEager for your supportThanks   "},

Both of them were like yearsold stuck in some teenagers bodies making them very boring and unlikeable Hazel was such an annoying stupid and pretentious Mary Sue that I wanted to punch her right in the face One great example of her stupidityWhy are breakfast foods breakfast foodsLike why dont we have curry for breakfast Augustus and Hazel have the same boring pretentious knowitall and indistinguishable personality Hazel is the female version of Augustus no Im not going to call him affectionately with Gus and he is the male version of Hazel These two characters meld together and have no depth at all I couldnt connect with them I felt no pain and sympathy for them and they annoyed me so much that I wanted to stab them   It fell from the sky Seriously I dont get whats so beautiful about the relationship between them They both fall in love within seconds just after laying eyes on each other    The romance is undeveloped and it comes from nowhere I was baffled when Hazel accepted to go to Augustuss house just minutes after meeting him WHAT THE HELL How stupid can you be You fall for a guys words whom you met just few minutes ago and agree to go to his house What if he were a murderer or rapist Not to mention that the kissing scene in Anne Franks house was so effing disgusting Anne Franks house is considered to be a place of remembrance a place where  families hid during the dark days of Holocaust If anyone makes out at such a revered site they would be kicked out regardless of who or what they are People present around will be disgusted they wont stand and watch much less clap for the lovely couple   Cheesy Emotionless Ambiguous Braincell burning Want to hear some favourite quotes of mine Here they areMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellationsWhy compare your thoughts to stars and constellations sighsSome infinities are bigger than other infinities Thats the thing about pain It demands to be feltYeah thats the thing about chocolate it demands to be eaten I believe the universe wants to be noticed I think the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed And who am I living in the middle of history to tell the universe that itor my observation of itis temporary UmmWhat Im in love with you and Im not in the business of denying myself the simple pleasure of saying true things Im in love with you and I know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitable and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust and I know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have and I am in love with you view spoilerThere will come a time when all of us are dead All of us There will come a time when there are no human beings remaining to remember that anyone ever existed or that our species ever did anything There will be no one left to remember Aristotle or Cleopatra let alone you Everything that we did and built and wrote and thought and discovered will be forgotten and all of this will have been for naught Maybe that time is coming soon and maybe it is millions of years away but even if we survive the collapse of our sun we will not survive forever There was time before organisms experienced consciousness and there will be time after And if the inevitability of human oblivion worries you I encourage you to ignore it God knows thats what everyone else doesMeThere were senseless dialogues braincell burning metaphors and words thrown around in the book from the dictionary Ill stop here because just thinking about them gives me an awful migraine And you know what Teenagers living in the st century DONT speak like that No teen can spontaneously come up with long monologues within seconds Also genuinely sick teenagers dont have the luxury to be so witty and clever every single time One thing I dont buy is that teens with cancer suddenly become magically wise They become terrified confused depressed and angry They DONT magically gain great insight in life and go around puking long monologues about the meaning of life This book made me roll my eyes in disgust      Predictable Boring Uninspiring Put me to sleep I had to plough through the whole book Cancer is hard its painful but this book didnt show me that I couldnt feel Hazel and Augustus struggle against it I couldnt feel their pain TFioS is nothing but a cheesy romance novelMe throughout the bookI knew that someone would die Augustuss death wasnt powerful enough if Green wouldve shown his death I wouldve understood why the world cried a whole bucket over himHe died eight days after his prefuneralWHAT THE HELL Green tried to make his death sound LIKE HE WENT TO A PARTY LAST WEEKOk so this book made you cry right If a book makes you cry it automatically doesnt mean that its a masterpiece I can understand that you mustve felt sad and sympathetic for the characters and mustve cried but considering that this novel is sad and it made you cry doesnt make it an awesome lifechanging and beautiful story I cried after reading Allegiant for days but I hated that book with burning passion it was one of the worst books I ever read    I dont understand why people compare The Fault in our stars to The Book Thief by Markus Zusak Zusak is a genius he handles his themes death love joy pain grief etc  brilliantly in his book he is an artist of words painter of vivid imagination his writing has enough power to break your heart and mend it on the same page TFios pales in comparison to a gem like The Book Thief I would rather shed my tears for a sick kid who doesnt know how to create a fking metaphor than to shed my tear on any of Augustus and Hazels ridiculous monologues I would rather shed my tears for the children dying in the civil war in Syria than cry buckets over the death of a pretentious unlikeable and flat character Before you start calling me a coldhearted bitch for hating and criticising this book let me tell you that if you think you have every right to go around fangirling how wonderful this book was then I believe that I have every right to express my hatred for it whether you like it or not I know that Im the only teenager on this planet who hates this book but honestly I dont care Would I recommend it NO I would rather recommend The Book Thief because it deserves the huge hype rather than this trashShailene Woodley has been cast as Hazel for the movieShes simply perfect for Hazels boring and unlikeable personality I never mentioned or implied that teenagers are illiterate or cant have a large vocabulary dont accuse me of something I havent said I just find it hard to believe that any teen can come up with nonsensical monologues like the ones below or think its appropriate to use them in their conversationsIm awash in the metaphorical resonance of the empty playground in the hospital courtyard  Like wtfEspecially when they are living in the st century because English language is completely different than what it was few centuries ago Also its hard to believe that anyone would talk like that in a normal conversation every single timeI am a teen and I go to high school I know many other teens of my age who have developed a large vocabulary and have brilliant writing skills That is simply because they love reading and have developed the habit of learning new words from the dictionary from a very young age I know teens roughly my age with almost perfect speaking and writing skills in English They write amazing poems and honestly it takes them a lot of time to ponder over and make their metaphors or poems perfect They obviously cannot open their mouth and spontaneously sayMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellationsBtw none of the teenage characters from this book show any interest in reading high literature and poetry the only book Hazel claims to read is An Imperial Affliction then whats the reason behind their ability to spew pretentious monologues What reason do they have to have a large vocabulary They arent geniuses they arent teens who read avidly or analyse high literature and show interest in oratory or love for poetry Therefore its not plausible for them to speak with profound wordsMoving on the quotes and metaphors in this book are stupid and cliched On deeper analysis youll understand that the philosophy in this book is not real philosophy its simply marketing Take for example this quoteLife is not a wish granting factoryHow many times have I heard this outside the book For me the quote above is not a good one Why Ive been told since I was  that life wont give you everything you want A good quote imo tells you something new and it makes you ponder over a new thing in the case of the quote above it tells me nothing new it shows me nothing new and doesnt make me think about anything new because Ive already thought over the unfairness of life  times before That quote is just paraphrased and the whole book is littered with such paraphrased version of quotes that we already come across daily in our lives in simple version People fall for such quotes because its written with profound words that make them feel that TFIOS teaches a lot of new things John Green is not a good author hes simply a marketing genius He has nothing new and interesting to tell and writeNow going over the cigarette metaphor Augustus buys a pack of cigarettes regularly just so he could put one in his mouth and not light it thus giving us another stupid dialogue Its a metaphor You keep the killing thing between your teeth but dont give it the power to kill you Funny that he wont kill himself by lighting up the cigarette but will regularly give money to an industry that is the largest cause of cancer thus promoting the cigarette industry and indirectly killing others What a genius Not to mention that he mocks Hazels cancer right on her face and guess her reaction Shes impressed and readily approves of and participants in his metaphorTheres a lot of difference between being wise and being pretentious and Hazel and Augustus are the latter I dont buy their dialogues because they are extremely ridiculous and cheesy and no argument by fans and authors can change my opinion because Green makes no effort in making the dialogues IN THE BOOK seem plausible Theres no reason for their large vocabulary and ability to spew long monologues IN THE BOOK and Im analysing only the book nothing outside it so why should I listen to an outside source Ive read Greens post on Augustus character being pretentious and imo he misses the point that his characters are not only pretentious they are extremely unrealistic as well Augustus pretension is not an intentional flaw its simply poor characterisationIm not saying that kids with cancer cannot be intelligent A lot of fans say that the characters in the book are special and wise because they have cancer and this book tries hard to show that too I merely said that having cancer does not mean that you can automatically become wise and gain a lot of knowledge Dont twist my wordsI couldnt sympathise with the characters and feel their pain That doesnt mean that Im cold hearted Its not my fault that I couldnt get emotionally connected to the characters its the authors fault for not writing characters I could sympathise with Its the authors fault for making shallow judgemental and annoying characters Its the his fault for making characters with personality that mocks cancer patients and who show disrespect to millions of people who died in the Holocaust Its the authors fault for romanticising cancer and using it as a ploy to sell his book Im NOT hating people who have cancer Im NOT hating the characters because they have cancer Im hating them for who they are Im hating the book because its poorly written I dont need to have cancer to analyse this book Having cancer does not mean that you get the rights to say whatever you want to about this book Every reader whether sick or not has equal rights to analyse and voice their opinions freely on any book And before you say omg you dont have cancer and youre not dying so youll obviously not understand this book let me tell you that you know nothing about me You dont know what Im going through you dont know my lifeline then what gives you the right to judge what my life is likeIll leave you with another quoteI got bored of this book the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at onceend rantbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   At age twentytwo John Green worked as a student chaplain in a childrens hospital Lets take a moment and consider all the implications of that and why he is making a colossal understatement when he described the experience as devastating That was about twelve years ago and Green has said in interviews that because of this experience hes spent twelve years trying to write a book about kids with cancer  not poster children of strength and courage and illnessgranted wisdom but real kids and their families and friends who have to cope with the fact that they will die young All novels are personal but Greens novels seem to me to be especially so But this one is personal in a different way With this novel Green isnt trying to exorcize the memory of the girl who stomped on his heart in high school This goes deeper than high school romance and Manic Pixie Dream Girl angst This is about life death illness love heroism and how a sixteenyearold is supposed to deal with the fact that she will die and leave everyone she loves behind Maybe its just because Ive been watching vlogbrothers videos for four years and feel like Im actually acquainted with John Green but this is the most deeply personal novel Ive ever read This is not as Hazel Lancaster might say a Cancer Book None of the cancer patients in this story have a wisdom beyond their years and they do not stoically accept the fact that they will die or fight heroically Hazel Lancaster a terminal sixteenyearold who has to carry an oxygen tank everywhere because my lungs suck at being lungs is refreshingly real  not manic not a pixie not a dream girl She reads Great Books and watches Americas Next Top Model marathons Augustus Waters her amputee friend wants desperately to leave a lasting impression on the world and philosophizes about heroism and his favorite book is a novelization of a video game can I say how much I love that an author can establish a characters intelligence without telling us that they love reading Austen yes Stephenie Meyer Im looking at you Everything here is real especially the diseases There isnt any bullshit about dying gracefully here because cancer is ugly and unpleasant and Green makes you feel Hazels lungs struggling to breathe and the pain and see the vomit and urine Remember how in A Walk to Remember Mandy Moore has been secretly dying of leukemia the whole time but looks great even on her deathbed Nicholas Sparks can fuck right off for that insult to real cancer patients Most importantly Hazel and Augustus are not defined by their cancer It consumes their lives but it doesnt define them On every page its clear this is a story told by someone who hasnt known just one person with cancer but has seen a multitude of children with terminal diseases and has tried to find some way to comfort them and their families Its for that reason that I dont feel like I can review this like a normal book John Green didnt write this story for me and so I dont feel like I have any place saying that its amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking And I certainly cant criticize any of its minor faults All I can say really is that you have to read this for yourself and go from there Okay you guys know me better than that I have one big complaint which I will describe here and all I ask is that you remember that I still gave this five stars Augustus Waters in the first few chapters comes off as a pretentious douche When Hazel first meets him at a cancer support group theyre talking afterwards and Augustus takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth Hazel who youll recall is dying because her lungs cannot function freaks out even though you HAD FREAKING CANCER you give money to a company in exchange for the chance to acquire YET MORE CANCER Augustus explains that he doesnt smoke the cigarettes he just puts them in his mouth no really because They dont kill you unless you light themAnd Ive never lit one Its a metaphor see you put the killing thing right between your teeth but you dont give it the power to do its killing Augustus I love you but youre full of shit right there Notice how he didnt address Hazels perfectly valid point that by buying cigarettes Augustus is giving money to the people who cause cancer Because heres the thing you can say to a cigarette company Im buying your cigarettes as a metaphor but I wont light them so Im taking away their power and theyll stop listening at Im buying your cigarettes because thats all they care about And its a shit metaphor in any case you can walk around a mall with a shotgun and explain to people that because its unloaded youve taken away its power but youre still going to get arrested So that was annoying as was Augustuss general air of overlycharming pretentious skeeziness in the beginning But I forgive him for it because lest we forget he is seventeen If his character was twentytwo hed be the most obnoxious jackass on the planet but because hes just a kid I was willing to forgive him Still hate the cigarette thing though   This is me after I finished the book and whenever I think about itpointless EDIT Woooah  likes Im surprised how many people are willing to read my little blurb of nothingness EDIT In a lot of peoples reviews I keep seeing they dont talk their age or They make these beautiful long speeches which is something that normal teenagers dont do and I have to point out that Augustus and Hazel ARENT normal teenagers Theyve had to go through so much more in their lifetime than a lot of teenagers will ever have to and its aged them And quite honestly this book wouldnt be as good if they were normal whatever that means sighs okay Im done proceed with reading If you want to Im just tiny words on a screen Do whatever you wantAs much of an amazing writer as I want to be Im really not So Ill just point out the things that made this book amazing I knew that I would cry so I really didnt bother swearing not to cry What I didnt expect is bawling my eyes out I really didnt John Green has done an amazing job of making these characters feel so real to me When they cried I cried bawled When they laughed I laughed When they melted I melted Their romance was so epic and I know I KNOW that this is a book I will read over and over again and cry every single time The characters were perfection Especially Augustus Waters Not only is his name Augustus which is epic in itself He had the guts to go up to Hazel and just straight up ask her to come hang out with him Nice guys finish last I think not You know this book was so awesmazing that I gave it its own tag Just look up there and youll see a little tag that says thefaultinourstars It was THAT amazing Seriously So amazing that Im pretty sure it was my first heartbreak from a book I really havent felt that much from a book much less a person in a very long time Im kind of a loner and a commitment phob not a good mix But my heart didnt just do this  it did this  BOOM didnt have a sign for thatI wish I could write more about this book but I just cant explain the amazingness of it with my simple unworthy words so I am going to tell you what you NEED to do READ IT    John GreenJohn GreenJohn GreenYoure not like Peter Van Houten are youWhat have you done to my brainand my heartIm not gonna review how exquisite John Green can write or how he can create characters as special as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters or how amazing he can tell a story Despite the huge number of ratings and the spectacular average rating this book is not perfect You might find it unrealistic because if there are many of us who see the life and its complexity like Hazel and Gus do this world will be such a happy place So like any other book this one also might be a miss or a hit If its a miss then you can say its not worth the hype But if its a hit it hits hard Everything in this book the characters the story the words they all have the power to be an inspiration If you havent read it I suggest to take the chance     starsEDIT Changed the rating because its gotten to the point where my sister and I have inside jokes on how stupid and shallow this book is I cant think about this book without getting angryI have a history with pretentious peopleMy biggest mess involved two boys in particular who were so incredibly full of themselves that for the first time in my life I openly expressed my dislike to them They know that I couldnt care less about their hotness or just how amazing they were So goddamn full of themselves spoiled rotten just overall horrible peopleIn short my personality clashes with theirs entirely and there really is no chance of a friendship Id dive into it but then this wouldnt be a book reviewAnd so I move onThe Fault in Our Stars is my first John Green bookYeah I know but I didnt really get into reading up until maybe four years ago And Im not too into contemporary but the opportunity presented itself and I took my first dive My sister is a fan of John Green She really loves Looking for Alaska and Will Grayson Will Grayson and finds Paper Towns to be LfAs quirky New Girl twin that doesnt own upI almost feel bad for disliking this book but thats strictly on the idea of cancer Cancer is horrible unpredictable and the worst part is that its your own cells mutating against you Thats why its so hard to defeat Thats what I wish this book was about dealing with the cancer that wants to kill you Instead I get a book about a fictional miracle drug that keeps Hazel alive so she can have a boy love her view spoilerthen die not even on sight either I came into this book with an open mind I assure you But I ended up really wanting to put the book down several times From the first few pages I felt something was actually wrong Like I didnt know what I was getting myself into Having finished this book which to me was such a chore to do I think Ive stumbled upon decent reasons as to why I really cant give this any more than two starsIf you didnt know by now The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel a girl whose thyroid cancer has ceased to grow thanks to a magical miracle drug But because her cancer life is just so boring a boy has to make it betterBecause that is the only way anything gets better in lifeBoyzCancer People Dear ReadersWRITINGThis was by far the largest problem I had Larger than Hazel saying I wanna tap that about Augustus on page  This prose was not the voice of a real teenager It tried but this did not sound like a teenager suffering from cancer This was the voice of a teenager who liked to say You know what sucks Cancer You know what else sucks Dying Why So the reader could laughAnd wouldnt you know it every line is like that There is no rest for any real emotion or interest Its all laced with some oneliner or trying to be hilariously philosophical when its just trying way too hard to keep a reader interested And this alone made me find great distaste in the character of Hazel She is not believable because I never learned anything about her She just hates Support Group and adores Augustus for reasons that were never clarified throughout the book Oh you like Guss smile his laugh The idea that he thinks of basketball really as a nod to a baby toy The idea that he spends money just so he can conduct a metaphor that doesnt do anything but make him look like a pretentious assholeOh who am I kidding This entire book was shallow and pretentious Everyone thought they were so hilarious because did you know that eggs are restricted to a breakfast food Those poor scrambled eggs No I dont give a flying fuck about scrambled eggs and their apparent oppression But think about it We only have eggs for breakfast Because you choose to point it out as suchOr get this how about the hurdles event in track You know what Augustus says about hurdles He says this after that beautiful basketball connection to a child shoving cylinders into circle holesAnd I wondered if the hurdlers ever thought you know This would go faster if they just got rid of the hurdlesTHIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST THINGS I HAVE EVER READ IN A BOOKAugustus Waters actual athlete says something like this about a sport Sports are a very healthy way to escape stress If anything Augustus and his philosophical ass should be wondering what the hurdles represent to the hurdlers HURDLES ARE A SPECIAL EVENT The hurdlers are probably doing a running event too They CHOSE to run the hurdles for the challengeBut this falls on the level of those scrambled eggs Hey If we talk about this and make it sound funny itll be deep Itll really scratch the heads of the readers This just shows how silly and thoughtful Augustus is Dont you guys just want to get with him and his awesome cigarette metaphor that HE SPENDS MONEY ON FOR NO FUCKING REASONGuh you fucking stupid ignorant son of a bitch This was the line by the way that got me in that level of dislike for Augustus that I got on with the asshole dudes that exist in my life And Hazel just sort of accepts this Like what the hell is everyone thinking in this book What universe are they in Because this is not a real universeI think now Im tracking into character territory so hereCHARACTERSHazel was the girl who referred to testicular cancer as cancer to the balls and then she sees Augustus Waters on page  of this book and goes Look let me just say it He was hot A nonhot boy stares at you relentlessly and it is at best awkward and at worst a form of assault But a hot boywellRemember if youre not drop dead gorgeous men your nice glances are only awkward Thats it You can never go farther and your delicious insight on life will never win the heart of a girl Because you are just not sexy enough or Augustinian for it Hazel likes to do this She likes to put down other guys for her Gus even though they still BARELY knew each otherI met Kaitlyn and her cute but frankly not Augustinian boyfriend for coffee one afternoonLOOK AT THAT What What is that This was a nice guy and Hazels like Well hes not a fucking Greek God so no thank you But what about Augustus Hazel You went to his house to watch a movie that you decided was just a silly boy movie that you knew you wouldnt like because you were a girl MOVIES DONT WORK LIKE THAT What are you even doingYou know what I just realized Hazel is a lot like Mary in The Forest of Hands and Teeth She hates one thing and loves only one material thing Hazel hates the cancer support group and loves An Imperial Affliction Mary hates the Unconsecrated but loves the ocean Thats all they have to their name Which is AMAZING to me that Augustus finds something to love about Hazel All it is is her John Green witIf you asked Gus what else was there to Hazel besides this one book thing and her wit I bet you a hundred dollars that he would respond as Derek in Swan Princess did with What else is thereBecause thats all their love is Theyre not bonding over the fact they have cancer They bonded over An Imperial Affliction then experienced an intensified Hey Arnold Episode about visiting the author who to no ones surprise I hope was a complete jackass then makes a  becausebecause Who needs reasonsHOWEVER the half star is devoted to Mr Peter Van Houten who was the only actual character in this book Everyone else was flat and pretentious assholes When Van Houten did it there was history behind it and a REASON He actually had an arc He did things Despite my lack of care for Augustus and Hazel the way Peter treated them was abhorring and the only way for me to fix that was to stab the man in the eye But he changed and revealed WHY he acted the way he did and there was sense made and he was a good characterSTRUCTUREStructure was fineStill flowed okay despite my need to be done with thisOVERALLI honestly thought everything was funny I laugh at a loooooot of stuff This whatever this is is not really that funny Its shallow and not really geared to people who want to know the world of cancer and stepping over the obstacle Its a cancerfilled girl loving view spoilerand losing  a cancerfilled boy Oh and they meet their favorite author whos actually an asshole Cancer is the backseat and I almost find it insultingI dont understand why people love this Tell me all you want that Augustus is a beautiful boy and Hazel just wanted something different in her life but dont you DARE tell me that this is deep This is not a deep book theres nothing that touches my heart except shallow wit and a poor man suffering from the cancerous death of his  yearold ray of sunshineI could go on but I think this is enough If it isnt well thats your opinion This is mine You are just gonna have to dealFinal RemarksThis book should have been about what happened to Peter Van HoutenItd be perfectly parallel to that Hey Arnold episode I mentioned but itd be better than what I readOR this book should have been about Hazel WITH THE TERMINAL CANCER Because her inner conflict with cancer would better clash with her ability to be with Augustus and it wouldve fleshed her out a hell of a lot more than giving her a magical miracle

{"title": "The Auschwitz Escape",
"isbn": "1414336241",
"author": "Joel C Rosenberg",
"text": "A terrible darkness has fallen upon Jacob Weiszs beloved Germany The Nazi regime under the leadership of Adolf Hitler has surged to power and now hold Germany by the throat All nonAryans  especially Jews like Jacob and his family  are treated like dogsWhen tragedy strikes during one terrible night of violence Jacob flees and joins rebel forces working to undermine the regime But after a raid goes horribly wrong Jacob finds himself in a living nightmare  trapped in a crowded stinking car on the train to the Auschwitz death campAs World War II rages and Hitler begins implementing his final solution to systematically and ruthlessly exterminate the Jewish people Jacob must rely on his wits and a God hes not sure he believes in to somehow escape from Auschwitz and alert the world to the Nazis atrocities before Fascism overtakes all of Europe The fate of millions hangs in the balance Only  are known to have escaped Auschwitz The most notable are Witold Pilecki a Pole who volunteered to go into Auschwitz and report to the world what he had seen and Rudolf Vrba a Slovakian Jew who escaped at age  The escape is told almost exactly how Rudolf Vrba and a friend escaped  by hiding in a pile of wood outside of the electrified fences and waiting three days searches went on for  hoursI cannot describe how much I loved this book The characters were realistic but amazing the plot was wellresearched and I really enjoyed the way Rosenberg handled Christianity Only one main character Luc was a Christian and he was just fabulous Hes not your average Christian and even Rosenberg knows it Many of the guards who beat kill and torture six days in the week  faithfully go to church every Sunday Jacob the protagonist does not become a Christian but he is deeply moved by Lucs passion for helping Jews Luc admits Martin Luther was the source of Hitlers propaganda and during an emotional scene apologized to Jacob for every wrong thing Christians have done to Jews throughout the years Protestant pastor Luc lets his Christian beliefs shine through his actions  he never tries to convert anybody I simply love that about him and wish more Christians would follow his example He refuses to ignore the horrors of the Holocaust and remain ignorant like the majority of Christians in Europe did Luc from a little village called Le Chambon in France represents the real Christians there that rescued around  Jews I love Le Chambon and really enjoyed how Rosenberg weaved that amazing story into the plot of his novel Jacobs arrest while not similar to Vrbas is based on the reallife Twentieth Train rescue  Jews escaped but only  actually survivedIt has been a whole month thats a long time for me since I last read a book I even enjoyed about a year since I read something that moved me this much and the first time Ive stayed up until  AM to finish a book The last time I read a book that moved me to tears was about a year ago The last time I read a book where I loved another character as much as I loved Luc was about  years ago  and that was the book that began my WWII journey That book was I Am DavidAlthough I am a bookworm I have never really read such an actionpacked thriller before that I seriously could not put down I have never read for over  solid consecutive hours The last  is nonstop action but not in a cheesy Hollywood wayI cannot speak highly enough of this book and will certainly be adding it to my Top  List I would certainly highly recommend to everyone You will not be disappointedThe real story httpflashtrafficblogwordpresscomPBS Docudrama on the real story full httpwwwpbsorgwnetsecretsepiso    As this story is based on horrific and unimaginable actual events it is scarier to me than a horror novel and will remain with meI was in tears at several points in this book as it has brutal details of life at Auschwitz I was captivated by the story and was  rooting for an escape that would lead to some quick action by the Allies to change the fate of these innocent people The notes describe the fictional vs the factual points of the book Fact  less than  people escaped from this hellhole Heartwarming was the story of Luc and others in his small French village who were Christians who rescued over  Jews and found them homes in several venues  this doesnt sound like many people saved but it was more than the population of this small town This is based on factAnytime I read a book that takes place over this period I cant understand the how and the why How is it possible that the world did not know and and waited so long to help Why would a nation get behind this lunatic and why didnt more people act with morality I did not fully like the religious Christian and Jewish undertones that the book took on at places a bit over the top I also thought that the plot had a few holes However this grabbed my heart and that is why I have rated it  starsI recommend this to fans of Historical Fiction and WWII especially Have a box of tissues handy   DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT EVER READ THIS BOOKAccording to Joel C Rosenberg its okay that  million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis because not ALL of the Jews died God got the Jews through it just like he saw them through Egyptian slavery Sure he only managed to save like  max of those who went into concentration camps but its all good Because he came through at the end You know after the Nazis had nearly finished what they set out to do effectively wiping out European Jewry as a whole because those who did survive immediately booked it for Palestine and the USAlso did you know Christians were not responsible Even though Ive never heard someone blame Christians for the Holocaust Joel C Rosenberg makes a hell of a lot of excuses for them and how even churchgoing Nazis werent real Christians No shit But Christians across Europe are culpable in the fact that a very very tiny percentage of nonJews in Europe actually did something to save the Jews Denmark and the French city of Le Chambon were anomalies in terms of actual communities of people who worked together to save Jews as were the individuals who made up various resistance groups but the MAJORITY of Christians in Europe were not only apathetic but were in fact COMPLICIT in the Holocaust especially in Poland where most threw morality and values out the window to turn in their Jewish neighbors to the police so they could be rewarded with loaves of bread I dont blame these people  they did what they had to in order to survive even if it meant culpability in systematic murder But this book basically asserts that all Christians in Europe were saints because they loved Jesus so much and Jesus was Jewish He spends less of the book on his weak plot and more on trying to get us to believe that Christians have literally zero responsibility for what happened He also seems to believe that Polish Christians were evangelical Protestants when in fact like  of Poles were Roman Catholic but I digressIts so alarmingly offensive I really dont even know where to begin Aside from Rosenberg making excuses on every other page and aside from him making every character try to force their belief in God in the main character Jacob Weisz who SHOCKER believes in God by the end of the book there are just so many problematic issuesI rolled my eyes at the less offensive nonsense but mostly gritted my teeth in rageOne of the best things ever was when Jacob fell in love with Abby who worked in the medical clinic and was part of the underground resistance along with him As hes getting ready to escape she gives him a gift and tells him to open it once they get outside So Jacob and Luc a French pastor escape naturally with a bunch of close calls But oh noes theyre really sick So Jacob decides to open the package Its from the medical clinic and theyre sick so youre thinking its gonna be medicine right WRONG ITS BIBLES Bibles If I just escaped a DEATH CAMP and had to run a couple hundred miles through a Polish forest crawling with people there to hunt me while running a fever the last thing Id want is a BIBLE But of course Jacob is like maybe God is watching out for me UGH UGH UGH UGHBasically the author is trying to say that Jews shouldnt have lost faith in God during the Holocaust because sometimes he looked out for his chosen people and even though it happened God ended it I mean come on God Too little too late amirite Of course many Jews did hold onto their faith because it got them through difficult times If that was how Rosenberg described things Id be totally onboard But those who did lose faith had a pretty valid reason They dont need some asshat who could barely do his research to come around  years later and explain why they should have all kept their faithTheres a lot to hate about this book but on top of everything the research done was abysmal Two sentences in a character quotes some madeup book Its  and the quote is evil unchecked is the prelude to genocide COOL except the word genocide didnt actually exist in a wide scale vernacular until  when it was coined and introduced by Raphael Lemkin That one little factual error irked me to my core but I clearly didnt know what was coming Id say like  of the anecdotes in and around the camps come straight from Laurence Rees Auschwitz There are smaller errors some intentional ie changing the dates Dr Mengele worked at the camp so it fit his narrative but most not Its just a mess of a book True god awful trash I picked it up because of the high ratings and then I remembered that most people are dumb and give this book a  because of Jesus and not because its actually good To be fair without Rosenbergs obnoxious proselytizing it moves quickly and tells a compelling story but it truly is evangelical propaganda thinly disguised as historical fiction If anything its religious fiction and Rosenberg should be ashamed of himself for taking a Jewish tragedy and turning it into a Christian missionary tale No Christians were not responsible for the Holocaust it was about racial makeup not religion I dont think anyone has ever blamed Christians for the atrocities committed But at the same time Christianity is not a solution to the suffering caused by the Nazis Doing this is SO problematic because youre essentially saying that its okay that Nazis killed millions of people because God eventually swooped in and saved a few WRONG GROSS AND WRONG    Where books are burned they will in the end burn people tooAfter a failed attempt by the freedom fighters to release the captured Jews from the disgusting cattle cars young Jacob Weisz finds himself locked inside and on his way to the dreaded hard labor camp of Auschwitz where within its evil barbed wire he thinks of nothing but escapeAs he witnesses the brutality sees the emaciated walking skeletons and learns the true secrets of the death factory it is he questions his faith in God as he struggles to survive from exhaustion and starvationAs the story continues Jacob eventually meets Pastor JeanLuc Leclerc a true believer in the Christian faith This novel wastes no time getting into the meat of it and kept my attention right through to the end Fast read   Another nailbiter by one of my favorite authors I loved this book I just simply couldnt put it down I read it in less than a week I kept thinking that it was a true story It was truly a work of history and suspense A hard book to write Im sure The author did a marvelous job taking true facts and weaving a fictitious character into them without sacrificing the true history I love World War Two and this book did not disappoint It was heart wrenching and accurate I am looking forward to more books by Joel C Rosenberg in the future Thank you Mr Rosenberg for all the hard work you put in to make this book enjoyable to a history buff like me I never once had to be frustrated with this work of historical fiction We can never forget what happened in the Holocaust as long as we have authors like this   "},

"text": "Sussex England A middleaged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral Although the house he lived in is long gone he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road where when he was seven he encountered a most remarkable girl Lettie Hempstock and her mother and grandmother He hasnt thought of Lettie in decades and yet as he sits by the pond a pond that shed claimed was an ocean behind the ramshackle old farmhouse the unremembered past comes flooding back And it is a past too strange too frightening too dangerous to have happened to anyone let alone a small boyForty years earlier a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road Like a fuse on a firework his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways The darkness was unleashed something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy And Lettiemagical comforting wise beyond her yearspromised to protect him no matter whatA groundbreaking work from a master The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out It is a stirring terrifying and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterflys wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark Sitting down to write a review of this book I dont quite know where to start I was going to quote a passage that I particularly loved But no good can come of that Once I opened that door where would I stop quoting So let me say this I genuinely loved this book I look forward to reading it again I will buy copies for my family as gifts I will listen to the audio and lament my own lack of narrative skill I will gush about it to strangers In short it is a Neil Gaiman novel There is truth here and beauty and joy and a sad sweet melancholy that moves through my chest like distant thunder I realize that what I am writing here is not really a review in any conventional sense It is a paen A panegyric It is the textual equivalent of a huge happy gormless grin And you know what Im fine with that Let the professionals write their reviews Let them get all jargony about it Let them try to pin this book to the page not realizing that a pinned butterfly holds no delight A pinned butterfly is nothing like a butterfly at all I make no claims to impartiality in regard to Gaimans work Sandman changed how I thought about stories Neverwhere was a talisman for me Stardust is a golden bell hung in my heart And American Gods taught me that there was a name for the sort of book I was struggling to write It was a picaresque So if youre looking for impartiality this is not the review for you Look elsewhere Me I will enjoy The Ocean at the End of the Lane without dissection It made me happy It made me feel less alone It made me love Neil Gaiman a little more than I already did and thats something I didnt think was possibleDo I hope to someday write a book like this No I never could Hes done something odd and strange and lovely here I couldnt hope to replicate it Instead this is what I hope In the future when Joss Whedon and I are best friends and hanging out together in my tree fort I hope Neil Gaiman comes over too Because then the three of us will all play Settlers of Catan together And I will win because Im really great at Settlers of Catan But I will also be very gracious about it and apologize for putting the bandit on Gaimans wheat twice in a row Then we will make smores and I will toast a marshmallow with such deftness and perfection that they will be amazed and realize I am kinda cool Then we will talk about Battlestar Galactica and which Doctor is our favorite and we will tell ghost stories late into the night God Im tired I should really go to sleep I have no idea what Im saying anymore I hope I dont regret this in the morning      This story is an amalgam of helplessness and innocent ignorance of childhood with universeold wisdom with mystery and wonder and unexplainable and unfathomable and things that lurk around the corners of reality and seep through the cracks in the world Theres friendship and love and cruelty and resentment And there are monsters  and in the true fashion of the tradition I love the real monsters come from the peoples wishes the peoples own selves the deep down dark that lives inside us  Maybe once upon a time you were seven and bookish and lonely and sometimes a stranger to your own parents Maybe your first experience with deaths brought into your world a strange family of three living just down the lane in a little farmhouse  the Maiden the Mother and the Crone of the fairytales Maybe your first ever friend elevenyearold or maybe infinitiesold who knows Lettie Hempstock the girl for whom in your sevenyearolds sense of own immortality you nevertheless are  will take you on an unexpectedly sinister journey culminating somewhere and somewhen under the haunting orange sky And maybe after that nothing will ever be the same  And maybe something from underneath that sinister sky will choose you as a way to break through reality into your little secure world of a child And maybe because of that you will come to a terrifying realization that the world is not safe that adults may not be there to protect you that world has teeth and is ready to bite you with them any time it wants to And you realize that nothing is as it seems  and that theres no reason why the pond cannot be Lettie Hempstocks ocean after all  There are certain authors that in my mind have become a genre of their own Neil Gaiman is one of them When I read his books I dont read fantasy or urban fantasy or any other such label What I read is    a unique blend of humor and dry wit and a strong narrative voice making the strangest leaps of imagination seem like nothing out of ordinary And every time when I put down the book of his Ive been reading into the wee hours of the night unable to stop I find myself with a haunting sense of longing and missing the world he created the world into which he so effortlessly immerses his readers the world of his storytelling that you never want to leave Its like Lettie Hempstocks ocean the waters of which you wish you never had to leave but where you cannot stay forever no matter how badly you would want to  Neil Gaiman again is at his best which for him is I guess just ordinary This book will join my personal favorites by him  especially The Graveyard Book to which its a soul cousin And I will revisit it in the future probably more than once just to hang out with Lettie and Old Mrs Hempstock and maybe to catch the hint of a wave on an ancient worldocean in the back yard stars       This book is childhoodAre all Neil Gaiman books like this So beautifully hauntingly nostalgic I confess this is my first but right now I am logging into amazon to make sure it isnt my last I have one criticism which is that this book isnt really an adult book The few adult scenes felt added as an afterthought to try and convince us little people that this is actually a very grownup kinda story But take out that dodgy sex scene and I would have been mesmerised and terrified by this book as a kid perhaps even more than I was reading it today It has everything that we could possibly ask for in childhood magic adventure overcoming fears those things that children know and adults no longer understand or remember and its all wrapped up in a tidy  pages Theres an almost dreamlike quality to the story and there are many reasons its hard to know whats real and what is not The book opens with a middleaged man revisiting the place where he used to live with his parents and sister when he was a young boy of seven He visits his old house before wandering down to the farm at the end of the lane a place that starts to bring back a strange sequence of memories as seen through the eyes of a young boy How real are the magic and monsters of our childhood When we look back and see ignorant youths believing in the impossible are we enlightened adults Or are we the ignorant ones blinded by years dedicated to being sensible and not believing Are the villains we remember monsters from another world Or is that just how children make sense of the people who brought upheaval into their livesI found it truly fascinatingThe creepy yet beautiful setting in the English countryside was fantastic A little lonely somewhat isolated like a world entirely of its own in which anything could be possible This book held all the charm and beauty of the world portrayed in Cider With Rosie but was ten times more compelling and addictive And there were the characters of course Lettie Hempstock an eleven year old who might just have been eleven for a very long time and her quirky mother and grandmother Also the narrator had my sympathy throughout his seven year old lack of understanding and fear of the adult world that he saw as separate from his own was easily believable for me I think we do create a world of our own when were kids one that adults arent a part of thats how were able to believe in things like magic and wizards and Santa To put it plainly I really enjoyed my first trip into the world of Gaiman The ending is perfect A little sad But mostly perfectBlog  Leafmarks  Facebook  Twitter  Instagram  Tumblr      hours ago when I read the last page for the first time I had this strange sad feeling Like I had come to the end of something beautiful without really comprehending the beauty of it until the last minuteWhich is why it took me a reread to realize how brilliant this book isShort Sweet Magical Scary RealThere is a reason this book is labelled as adult and it has nothing to do with sexual content or violence or gore To be an adult by age is meaningless because to truly appreciate this book you must be an adult by experience You must be adult enough to miss childhoodMe Im not there yet I dont miss being a child because I remember being a child I can still see it when I turn backSo right now no This is not my favorite Gaiman bookBut in odd years it probably will beBecause The Ocean at the End of the Lane is one of those booksIt can only grow in appeal the older you get     In the acknowledgments section of his latest novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane Neil Gaiman admits that the project was initially meant to be a short story which grew to be a novel  not a very long novel but a novel nonetheless For fans it was big news as it would be his first novel for adults since s Anansi BoysI was never really into Gaimans work  I wasnt crazy about American Gods or Neverwhere and Coraline all of which are routinely mentioned as fan favorites I loved Stardust though  his short fantasy which I thought was beautiful and had to read in one sitting The Ocean sounded like a a welcome return to the familiar field and I was compelled to give it a tryGaimans narrator is an unnamed English man in his forties who returns to his childhood home located in the English countryside of Sussex There he is drawn to familiar places which he has not seen for ages and which evoke memories long buried He ends up by the house of his childhood friend Lettie Hempstock and remembers when he was seven years old and how Lettie used to call the pond beside her house an oceanUltimately this is a lazy book  for several reasons The first one is an enormously flat and dull narrative voice The narrator is obviously remembering his youth from an adult perspective but the end effect is reduced to sentences in vein of I did this and that And then this happened Theres absolutely no childish joy or fear or even the adults surprise at a sudden recollection of a forgotten memory of youth The language is lackluster flavorless and as flat as the steppes of Kazakhstan to the point of becoming downright dull and distracting because of its dullness How are the readers supposed to give a damn if we can barely muster the strength to turn the pagePerhaps its my own recent personal experience of spending a week in an English village while visiting my friends but I thought that the setting of this book was another lost opportunity The countryside is beautiful but all the the reader will get from it in this book is the fact that people live on farms and sometimes have small ponds near their houses Theres no sense of place specific to Sussex or England in this book at all it could as well have taken place in the suburbs of ChicagoNot that long ago I read and reviewed  the debut novel of Jonathan Carroll a fan favorite considered to be classic of fantasy  which I found to b a bland play on fantasy tropes without much originality I have the same complaints about The Ocean  which really is nothing more than an overly stretched short story employing all the well known staples of the genre and made up to resemble a short novel The protagonist is an obvious standin for the author but besides waxing nostalgia and melancholy the novel doesnt seem to have any real goal or accomplish anything in particular It reads almost like Neil Gaimans rushed assignment for a creative writing class he took ages ago  full of pretension of powerful statements about human beings deep as the ocean but in reality being little else than the wellknown drizzle deep no more than an ordinary puddle which evaporates after a few days and leaves absolutely no mark    "},

"text": "Private investigator Cormoran Strike returns in a new mystery from Robert Galbraith author of the  international bestseller When novelist Owen Quine goes missing his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike At first Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few daysas he has done beforeand she wants Strike to find him and bring him homeBut as Strike investigates it becomes clear that there is more to Quines disappearance than his wife realizes The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous penportraits of almost everyone he knows If the novel were to be published it would ruin livesmeaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silencedWhen Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before     Yes  Pun intended   If you are respectably active on the reading community it will be no surprise that this Robert Galbraith is really the megafamous writer JK Rowling author of the ultramegafamous book series of Harry Potter Why bother on making up the pseudonym when it was revealed after like two weeks when the first novel of this different series got out thats a mystery to me Yes another pun intended P Evidently the genre topics and setting of the Cormoran Strike book series is totally different from what you find on Harry Potter but there are other authors writing different kind of genres and to different target audiences and still they keep their own established author namesAnyway the relevant point here is that Robert Galbraith doesnt exist but JK Rowling definitely exist and a lot in the literary world  While this still is a fictional detective mystery novel I think that easily can be one of the most personal books that JK Rowling ever written Due that in the first book of this series she chose the world of modeling and couture but in this second novel she is opting to use the world of publishing books as the ambiance for the mystery to solve  The story is set like eight months later of the previous book and if you hadnt read it yet but you just cant wait to read this one you can do it since while its a series you will get the very basic highlights that you need to know to get into the second book BUT without spoiling the culprit on the first novel So you can even read both books in reverse order and you still be able to enjoy and get surprised in both novelsNow Cormoran Strikes business is rising up thanks to his success in solving the Lula Landrys case The lovely Robin is still his assistant THANK YOU JK ROWLING I LOVE YOU FOR THAT and the good thing is that her role in this book series will be growing and growing While Robin was my anchor on the first novel and the main reason to keep reading and reading the first book I am truly glad to mention that I still love Robin BUT now I do like a lot the character of Cormoran Strike too and there is no doubt that he is the truly main character of the series The two of them now are making a wonderful team Beware villains Here comes Strike and Robin Yes this is a third pun intended Please indulge me  Strike has been quite busy getting a lot of clients meaning that his business of private detective is finally afloat However he is kinda dissapointed that many of these cases are basically discovering cheating spouses or crooked politicians so when he finds in front of him what it seems the chance of helping a helpless old woman to find her husband he accepts even while the chance of getting a payment out of this seems really unlikely    I am truly glad to mention that while the first book took like an  of writing to boost my interest in here it was right from the beginning In the first book it was like monotonous interviews basically asking the same questions and reliving the same crime scene on and on and onzzzhmmh Oh rightIn here while he still does interviews each of those are really interesting asking different stuff looking for different angles on the case Also another good thing was that while in the first book you get to know irrelevant moments of Strikes personal life in this second novel Rowling was able to exploit each personal moment to be totally involved in the case The story is focused on the case however there were some scenes mentioning other cases where Strike is working too Yes I understand that in real life detectives work in several cases at the same time but in literature one doesnt want to lose time reading about irrelevant cases that arent the main storyI commented on the first book that it could be better with less pages and I was glad to see that this second novel has less pages than the first book making the rhythm of the story more fluent However if Rowling can make the third novel since I do hope the making of a third book in the series with even less pages I really think that this book series can be a total blast having novels with  pages or less focusing in scenes only about the main case  I was delighted to know that I was wrong about who the culprit was on this case I think that any reader of detective novels invested time in the middle of the reading experience trying to deduce who did it And again JK Rowling surprised me with a great process by Strike joining the clues and exposing the case And when Strike is explaining it you say Wow Yes hes right All those clues were there  Well JK Rowling you did it again And even better  This second book is a real proof that lightnings can strike twice JK Rowling brought magic to the hearts of readers with Harry Potter and now she is thrilling them with Cormoran StrikeDefinitely this second novel is an enormous improvement from the overall reading experience of the first book now the book series is on tracks and I can hardly wait for the third novelHighly recommended    Its not an easy task but every day I do my best to read a bit of all those novels out there    Welcome I still see him as Hugh Jackman with some hair style to matchand Emma Watson as his adorable blonde smart secretary RobinAnd Welcome to The Case of the Manuscript of    Well dont look at me just like thatits      Mohammed ArabeyActual Read from st July To  Aug First Preview is hiddenview

    And just like that JK Rowling under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith takes on the familiar to her world of writing and publishing bringing to light the petty conflicts backstabbing attitudes hurtful gossips and inflated egos The bared claws and atyourthroat attitudes the dislikes and grudges held between successful writers and less successful ones the wannabe writers the ones who can and cannot write well the agents the publishers  it all looks like an ugly mess to say the least  This unpleasant world serves as a backdrop for a rather gruesome murder    that matches precisely the final scene in the victims book The victim Owen Quine is a nottoosuccessful writer and frankly a very unpleasant person whose latest book seems to focus on trashtalking everyone connected to him in the literary world and personal life and pisses off quite a number of people In fact it seems to have upset someone enough to brutally murder Quine in a way that combines intestines and hydrochloric acid and a feeling of nausea trying to imagine the resulting crime sceneIt of course falls to the private detective Cormoran Strike who recently solved the murder of Lula Landry earning himself some notoriety and a bit of cash to untangle this mess and find the killer Yet again hes aided by his secretary Robin Ellacott who having worked with Strike for a while now dreams of receiving some investigative training herself seeing that she has a knack for the job  while struggling to explain her love for the job and admiration for her gruffy boss to her way more conventional fianc MatthewRowling continues the pattern she set in the first Strike book The solution to the mystery unfolds slowly through the grunt of investigative work through long interviews with suspects through long treks on the streets of London with many false trails and red herrings guided by Strikes unerring sense and skill The mystery is slowmoving and lacks the easy gotcha moments hinged instead on character studies allowing the suspects to slowly reveal their inner selves full of shallow and sometimes quite dark unpleasantness propelled by almost casually shrewd observations of social inequalities and prejudices Every character short of almost idealized Strike and Robin  just for once can Cormoran Strike ever be wrong about anything gets the nottoopleasant but very apt treatment of Rowlings sharp characterization which makes them come alive even when youd rather them not The plotting is intricate the multiple plot strands so tightly woven together that its a pleasure to look back at the end of the story and see how they all were coming together And even the annoying turn in the last quarter of the book when Strike has solved the murder but the readers are kept waiting for the final reveal does not spoil the enjoyment of the storyAll in all I enjoyed this book quite a bit While not perfect it captures Rowlings talent as a storyteller and a master plotter quite well  stars Ill be quite happy to follow the adventures of Strike and Robin for quite some time    stars  SpoilersDisappointing it wasnt awful but it wasnt good either It was all rather predictable and generic I wouldnt have minded the cliches and obviousness of it all if the main characters Strike and Robin had stood out in some way Sadly they didnt I didnt care about either of them I actually kind of hated both I wasnt a fan of the writing there were a number of times where I came across sentences that didnt flow very well Some of the more difficult words seemed to be added in just to make the writing seem more impressive but it only ended up doing the oppositeThere was nothing actually impressive or genius about Strikes detective skills or intelligence the only reason he came across as half competent was because most of the people around him were completely thick I mean literally everybody on the police force were thickos Yea I could maybe buy a few of them being dim or lazy or something but not all of them Most police officers have years of experience and various trainingqualifications not to mention all of them have access to countless resources and other experts criminal psychologists and the like I very much doubt Strike could compete with that  so yea the only way to make his character come out on top and solve everything was by making everyone else dumb which was plain lazy writingI didnt like the heavy handed portrayal of Robin and Matthews relationship Its so obvious theyll end up splitting up because of Matthew not supporting Robins quest to be an investigator the amount of times he was shown as not understanding Robin or her work was ridiculous It kept cropping up over and over it was like Rowling was trying to make extra sure that her readers knew how unsuitable Robin and Matthew were for each other whilst simultaneously notsosubtly showing how us perfect Strike was for Robin and how he understood her Ugh it made for nauseating readingWhat was with Robin being all submissive and servantlike when it came to Strike Yea he was her boss but she went above and beyond her work duties She acted more like a downtrodden dutiful wife the way she fetched things for him and made him tea and coffee Of course Strike loved her meek submissive wifey behaviour and thought she was such a good little girl whenever she was quiet and did all his bidding Ugh it was all rather misogynistic and cringey It was laughable that so many beautiful and successful women like Nina kept throwing themselves at overweight hairy unsuccessful middle aged bland Strike Yea bloody right It was disgusting and off putting when Strike called Nina desperate and needy for wanting to sleep with him straight away Yet he didnt think any badly of himself for sleeping with her when he didnt even like her at least Nina slept with him because she for some reason fancied him Whereas he basically slept with her just because and as a thanks for the information she provided on his case though she didnt know that his behaviour was rather prostitutelike He had no right to be casting judgement on anyone else The prickThere were so many stereotypes of women they were either some variation of a Mary Sue or they were shallow desperate losers who threw themselves at Strike or were completely messed up None of the women came across as real peopleWhat was with all the female characters eatingdrinking things like soupssaladswater whist Strike was chugging down pints and having steak and chips It was irritating to read the females always eating such healthylittle food whilst Strike stuffed his face with all sorts Has Rowling never met any women who eats takeaways or desserts or somethingI actually think I would have enjoyed reading Bombyx Mori the much talked about manuscript in the book more than this  it sounded wonderfully bonkersI did really love some of the side characters they were infinitely more interesting than Strike and Robin I also enjoyed the setting and descriptions of London  it was captured really well All in all this was just a run of the mill mystery novel  the main characters were so blah and it was obvious who the bad guy was as soon as they were introduced Yea I expected more from Rowling   The Silkworm is the tenth JK Rowling novel Ive read I believe that after ten often gargantuan novels I can make fairly accurate generalizations about her writing And it saddens me to say that she keeps making the same mistakesMost glaring is her treatment of female characters In the Cormoran Strike mystery series we have another female character of much greater intrigue shunted to the side in favor of a male protagonist aka Hermione Granger Syndrome Robin is Strikes young personal assistant who could definitely contribute to mystery solving but mostly answers phones schedules appointments makes coffee and provokes male gazing The thing is Robin is much more fascinating to me than Strike Robin is desperate unsure diffident but ambitiousshe would have been a fabulous heroine for a detective series about a woman trying to break into a traditionally male profession Strike on the other hand does not interest me as a protagonist hes arrogant and infallible sorta reminds you of a character whose name rhymes with Barry Lotter non meaning that whenever Strike eliminates a suspect from contention I know him to be absolutely right simply because JK Rowling writes Strike in a way that he is always right For all of Rowlings characterization skills Strike is lacking He has a cool backstorymissing leg missing rockstar fatherbut none of it manifests itself in his psyche or quotidian actions They are just things we know about him like oh hey thats Cormoran Strike he lost his leg in Afghanistan and his dad is a famous guitarist In general I find JK Rowlings characterization maddeningly brilliant Shes super into the physicality of her characters In The Silkworm the first few chapters serve no other purpose than to introduce the storys players But we are told who these people are with special emphasis on their attractiveness and oneword descriptors hes the ambitious one and shes the daffy one Rowling is an expert at character portraits but you can only know the characters on her unique terms theres no room for personal interpretation Its as if she is this master dollmaker Each character is impeccably painted you can admire the surface details for hours but if you cracked the dolls open theyd be hollow Nothing murks beneath the detailed yet limited picture Rowling has painted us And yet shes a magnificent plotter a skill really wellsuited to the mystery genre which gives me hope for any subsequent installments though I will perpetually groan about Strikes usurpation of the protagonist role in lieu of Robin She carefully charts her reveals and includes tons of clever but useless information to throw you off Im not the biggest fan of how she writes climaxesthis isnt participatory mystery where you can solve alongside the detective you must wait for MindNumbingly Boring Detective Genius Cormoran Strike to figure it out and share his conclusions with youbut the underlying plot structure is solid Id just love to see her combine this knack for plot with deepened characters and themes Otherwise its forgettable    "},

"text": "Fate takes many forms    When Henry receives a letter from an elderly taxidermist it poses a puzzle that he cannot resist As he is pulled further into the world of this strange and calculating man Henry becomes increasingly involved with the lives of a donkey and a howler monkeynamed Beatrice and Virgiland the epic journey they undertake togetherWith all the spirit and originality that made Life of Pi so beloved this brilliant new novel takes the reader on a haunting odyssey On the way Martel asks profound questions about life and art truth and deception responsibility and complicity I literally just finished Yann Martels new book Beatrice and Virgil BV for brevitys sake about  minutes ago I am shaken with rage as the book is one of the most hateful and ghastly jumble of horrors I have ever finished At least it is mercifully short In fact it is so short it can hardly be called more than just a long short story The main story clocks in under  pages there is tons of white space and the last  pages are games that feel lifted from works about the Holocaust ranging from Roman Polanskis The Pianist to Sophies Choice I read Life of Pi when it first came out and then again last week It will always stand as one of the best books of my reading life Beatrice and Virgil is a jumble a writer whos book has just been rejected a play that is occasionally exquisitely written that vibrates with beauty and life a comingtoterms with the Holocaust the revealing of a Nazi war criminal who somehow escaped detection who is allowed to live a silent life of peace a hungry donkey and the scream of a Howler monkey But what does it mean I dont know I think Mr Martel had terrible writers block after Pi the dreaded curse of the sophomore book even though Pi is really his second novel and he wants to write about the Holocaust in a new way But he overreaches And the book references waaaay too many other works of literature Many are mentioned by other reviewers and even Mr Martel quotes a story by Flaubert in long sentences so it is hard to really even hear Martels own voice BV reminds me so much of Ian McEwans The Comfort of Strangers in that it is so short has a bloody graphic ending that comes out of nowhere and takes place in an anonymous European city When it does shine through it is lovely especially early in the book read the  page description of a pear during the play that comes to him in bits and pieces by a struggling writer also with writers block clothed as a taxidermist Both protagonists are named Henry but usually the elder taxidermist is simply called the taxidermist His wife is immediately repulsed by him the waiters down the street treat him like a leper and he gives everyone except Henry extreme cases of the willies Henry sees brilliance in the taxidermists play and wants to shepherd it But the terse oblique removed and socially awkward taxidermist is afraid that Henry will steal his material and as a reader the deeper we got into the play the less I wanted to see it In Pi we are caught up in moments of graphic animal violence but it makes sense within that story and is balanced out by deep insights into spirituality In BV the graphic animal violence does nothing to serve the story except to try to give a new voice to the Holocaust and it simply doesnt work I dont want or need Martel to write a Pi sequel But this book is so abstract and cluttered with images that it feels like Martel cut up a bunch of better books on the subject threw the pieces up in the air gathered them up in random order added a hungry donkey and a monkey who howls and barfed them out in novella form In the end BV was gigantic disappointment for me Maybe I should try to digest the book before immediately reviewing it but I need a shower because it made me feel dirty  starsUPDATE This review has generated a lot of comments and I have actually bonded with some members of GoodReads over this review you know who you are As you may tell from my statements I was horribly disappointed with this book But I finished it weeks ago and I saw Yann Martel speak on  I just want to put this entire episode out of my mind forever I had prepurchased  copies one for me to have signed by the author I so admired to keep forever and one to sell in a few years if hopefullyat the time it won a few awards I have made book investments like that before and they have paid off I had a leather bound reissue of Bluebeard by Vonnegut that was signed and  weeks after his death I got  for it I have some first edition Philip Roth signed books and a few others Because I despised BV SO much I actually took the books back even though I had read one of them It took me less than  days to read it and I took the dust jacket off and handled it with such care that it could have be resold as totally new I feel Karma nipping at my heels because I have NEVER in my life taken back a book that I actually read and requested my money back I dont like the way it feels and I have to live with that in my mind and now out on GoodReads forever And my investment is also goneI lately found out that I can give a book ZERO out of  stars so I changed my review to reflect that Art is so subjective some people will look at a John Crapper toilet at the Smithsonian and say ART and others will say GARBAGE and they are BOTH right What is the effing point of getting into an argument how someone feels about a book Is this not why sites like this exist They exist SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GIVE THEIR OPINIONS Not to fight So with the exception of Douglass who I sent a private message to contact me outside of this discussion Please contact me I have to divorce myself from this particular thread Im exhausted from being attacked sucked back in being asked questions I cannot answer and mostly having to think about this horrible mess of a book again and again and again NEW UPDATE I just found out that you cannot give zero starsGR counts it as unrated Even though I still despise this book Ill give it one star but only under protest   Its hard to review this book I loved the first part so much the simplicity and innocence of it It was so seemingly transparent and human and honest Then it turned it didnt become something else it revealed what it had been all alongIve read reviews with people saying they felt manipulated conned tricked They are expressing anger over the book and the way it approached the subject and who it was approached by Who is HE to be writing so offensively about the HolocaustThe symbolism in the book is too loud and too abundant to make any real sense of I first thought to describe it as walking around in a dry dusty overly warm shop with too many odd and confusing things on display for a mind to process but every time you turn to collect your thoughts to try to analyze one symbol you cant help but have another already in your face I disregarded that image because I found I was describing the taxidermy shop and didnt want to be using one symbol to describe the way his symbolism was to the sensesThen I thought of it as someone singing in an echo chamber They keep singing even though the song is just echoing all around so you cant hear the words or follow the melody since it keeps reverberating back at you again and again changing the song into something unbearable But that reminded me too much of the noise of the howler monkey Virgil In the end I decided to not try to decipher the symbolism to describe it at all I will just go ahead and describe how I felt after reading this book whether its what Martel intended or notI felt traumatized The book was a traumatizing experience I think thats why so many people reacted with such anger It was a hurtful manipulating offensive book But given the context and the forewarning I think thats what it was supposed to be It was as I see it anyway the flip book that Henry tried to get published The first part was the essay with the author setting his premise and the second part was the book of fiction going at the topic from a different way And again I dont know whether this was Martels intention but for me feeling overwhelmed and confused and overall traumatized is what someone should feel after reading about the Holocaust The book evoked the emotion of it created the residue of the aftermath one critic said she needed a shower after reading it because she felt dirty the trembling feeling of powerlessness It did an excellent job of making its reader feel victimized giving readers a hint of the idea of what its like so that it wont be forgotten The symbolism in the book is too hard to pick apart piece by piece Theres just too much of it and it overlaps and interwinds and is just another layer of being assaulted in itself But there were two things that really stood out for me as I was readingFirst off the fact that Henry the Taxidermist would never let Henry the author read the play himself but rather read it aloud to him The first time he did this I bristled I cannot stand for someone to ask my opinion of something and then read it to me I have to read the words with my own eyes This continued throughout the book with Henry the author finally commenting To read on ones own and to be read to are two very different experiences Not being in control of the words submitted to his attention unable to establish his own pace but rather dangling along like a prisoner in a chain gang he found that his level of attention and retention had variedThe issue of control here and mentioned again in the scene at the cafe when Henry the Taxidermist reads aloud to Henry the author again causing him to think Even here in public he was going to read aloud What a control freakIt lets us know that were not in control here The suffocating prickly feeling of things spinning away from us should have started up the survival senses alerting us that were in a trap here followed up immediately with my favorite observation of the whole book You dont like people do you Henry said which he meant lightlyThe taxidermist looked at the passerby for another moment then turned his gaze onto Henryand it was a pinpoint of concentration wholly focussed on him animallike in its intensity exactly that animallike As the taxidermist bore into him with his steady eyes a single thought occurred to Henry I am peopleIt wasnt a fun read It was traumatizing I wasnt offended by someone not personally touched by the Holocaust writing the book as some other people were I felt it appropriate in what he was sayingthat it affected all of us and will continue to touch us and hurt all of us forever you cant be removed from it by time and proximity its something that each of us carries with us because were human and share the history of being humanAt least thats what I got out of it   My first reaction was a howl a braying if you will into the vastness Martel does not allow us to look away He puts his everyman in charge of his own story and it is not a pretty sight Echoing great voices in literature through the centuries Martel chooses elements from many to create a symbolically dense but figuratively simple narrative in which a taxidermist lovingly recreates the beauty once inherent in animals now long dead Killednay massacred defaced defiled tortured and humiliatedbut killed make no mistake by everyman The simple language the brave humor the loving touch and gentle conversation between two doomed creatures who have seen much and suffered more elicits a moan of pain sadness and regret It takes a brave man to take on the big questions Martel clearly studied the greatsthose classic works of literature art and music handed down through the centuriesto see what links them to us now Dantes    shows us man much as he is this very dayno better no worse Becketts deceptively simple dialog in    Shakespeares complexities in    Prousts sensual descriptions in    are all reflected refracted through Martels lens He primes us with the bright fractured landscapes of Chagall and the heartstopping chords of Mozart and onward he leads us clueless Hamlets to view with him the world we lived in live in now a world we create anew each day Trivial is not a word I would use to describe this book Anguished is more the word I would choose That animals speak for us with us to us makes us search anew for meaning That the Horrors stands in for the Holocaust makes neither less potent That man is as he is is no less clear And you fair critic Dare you walk in the footsteps of the greats Dare you take on the challenge of making art not war Show us your colorsLater now I find myself still plumbing the depths of this horror In describing it to a friend I call it puzzling and disturbing and that it does not really succeed as a straightforward story One always has a brooding sense of doom and of something much darker meant by an otherwise ordinary reference Why does he choose a twofingered hand jesture for his sewing kit list Why does Virgil have a soliloquy of just one long sentence What is the meaning of his sic onelongword evilivingroomanerroneously Why Why Why   I think this book now holds the dubious honor of the worst book I have ever finished Its derivative dull  pretentious The story within the storya play featuring Beatrice and Virgil a monkey and donkey walking across a striped shirtis a cheap ripoff of Waiting for Godot There are other plot points involving the narrator Henrys pets that seem to come from nowhere and lead nowhere Finally the book ends with a series of philosophical questions that strive to be profound but remind me of nothing more than Homer Simpsons musing on whether Jesus could microwave a burrito so hot that he himself could not eat itI loved Life of Pi but I cant imagine ever reading Yann Martel again after this   You know those people who get put off by a book sheerly because of how popular it is and get it in their head that it sounds boring the blurb gave it a selfhelpfictionish tinge and I loathe selfhelp and is bound to be mainstream cause so many people are reading it Yeah Im one of those I saw people everywhere reading Life of Pi for a couple of years before I caved and read it  and I have to use a clich here I was blown away by how fantastic it was If you havent read it I hope you do Dont read any reviews or get any opinions first just read itSince the Life of Pi mania good on im too Canadian author and all weve all been eagerly anticipating his next book Martel felt it too He takes an ironic poke at our expectations and his possible failings as an author at the very beginning of Beatrice  Virgil which starts off with a writer Henry no doubt loosely based on Martel himself who after phenomenal success with his first novel takes five years to write a second about the Holocaust only to have his publishers knock it down flatWith his wife Susan a nurse they pack up and move to another city Henry doesnt try write a new book but picks up a job in a chocolate caf and joins an amateur theatre group But he still receives fan mail from all over the world and one letter changes everythingIts a letter from a man also called Henry  or rather its not a letter but a photocopy of an old Flaubert short story called The Legend of SaintJulian the Hospitaller and a scene from a play in which two characters called Beatrice and Virgil discuss the beauty and magnificence of a pear A handwritten note is included simply asking for Henrys helpHenry is perplexed unsure what the two manuscripts have in common or what kind of help hes being asked for though he assumes its the writerly kind Coincidentally the address is only a few streets away so Henry decides to walk his perfunctory reply over It turns out to be a taxidermy full of incredible stuffed animals and animal skulls The taxidermist is a highly unusual man and quite alienating inspired by a stuffed donkey and the stuffed howler monkey that sits on her back his characters are a donkey and a monkey The two animals live on a shirt  a striped shirt  and talk about what to do nextAs Beatrice and Virgils story reveals itself piecemeal Henry gets closer and closer to the truth about the taxidermist Its a truth that will quietly explode in his face and change him foreverThis is most likely not the story you would have expected or at least its tone and style is not When I started it I had no idea where it was going and so let myself drift on its words taken where it willed This usually pays off and it did here too This is a book you dont want to overthink but let quietly stew in your mind for a bit and just feel If you try to stop thinking as you read youll find the story can live and breathe in your head and take you to a deep dark place If nothing else Martel is a delightfully subtle and absorbing writerIts written in a style I dont know the word for heavily thirdperson very omniscient but sharing only what it wants to giving us only one perspective Henrys and a strangely limited one at that yet revealing much Its very narrative almost like theres a voiceover narrator as in movies like Stranger Than Fiction Like this One day he saw a sign posted in a window HELP WANTED On impulse he inquired Henry didnt need a job in fact he couldnt work legally but he liked the people at The Chocolate Road and he admired their principles He applied they were intrigued they agreed that he would be paid in shares and lo Henry became a small shareholder in a chocolate concern and a parttime waiter and general helper ppThis calm studied style is intercepted by excerpts  bits of the short story scenes from the taxidermists play and Games for Gustav at the end Its not just the style the voice that makes this novel truly unique I could never get it muddled in my head with any other story but the characters tooBeatrice the donkey and Virgil the howler monkey are two characters you wont be able to forget in a hurry I finished this book nearly a week ago and theyre still alive and fresh in my head Considering how lacklustre Henry is and how unpersonable the taxidermist is Beatrice and Virgil really are the main characters here Its interesting how they serve two purposes The taxidermist whose past I wont reveal for it would spoil the story is writing his play ostensibly to draw attention to needless animal cruelty to the destruction of their natural habitats their homelessness Their entire situation is an allegory for something else and yet even if it werent its still highly relevant That struck me quite a bit actually The parallels the way we treat animals  the way we treat humans like we treat animalsThere was much here that I admired that deeply impressed me not to mention the tragic story of Beatrice and Virgil and how towards the end it made me cry But I confess I didnt love it as much as I did his previous book Its not that its largely uneventful It might not be actionpacked or highly dramatic I dont care for that I think it comes down to the style its written in Even though it fits the story perfectly  I dont know that it could have been written any other way and still have the same impact  its not a style that sits comfortably with me Even while Im drawn into the story theres a part of me thats sitting outside of it cold and alone and pushed away I guess when it comes down to it writing being an art form theres some pain in good art Good art should make you at least a bit uncomfortable because if it is it will make you think Its also a very clever book without being at all pretentious or slick The apparent simplicity of the narrative voice gives it humility but its not an easy style to master If nothing else Martel has proven he can really writeThats not what I think of though I think of Beatrice and Vigril and their homelessness their list their love for each other their sacrifices And I bleed just a little bit for them for all of them I get the same tinge from books like Five People You Meet in Heaven and    Its probably unjustified but they seem to me to be books that are meant to be uplifting and all that Selfindulgent I say Ugh Youll never see me reading them Yes I know but I draw the line somewhere You can read it for free online here   "},

"author": "Anne Frank",
"text": "Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life Anne Franks remarkable diary has since become a world classica powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spiritIn  with Nazis occupying Holland a thirteenyearold Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding For the next two years until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo they and another family lived cloistered in the Secret Annexe of an old office building Cut off from the outside world they faced hunger boredom the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters and the everpresent threat of discovery and deathIn her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period By turns thoughtful moving and amusing her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling selfportrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short My intention of writing a review for this book is to tell all the negative reviewers to SHUT UP I am all for everyones right to express their opinion but I read a few of the  star reviews and I was shocked to read what a few people had to say about this book Before making an opinion I suggest people to keep a few things in mind This is someones DIARY not a book meant to entertain people If you think it was boring then answer me how many interesting things can you possibly do locked up in a place for  years For those who comment on the writingThis is a year olds diary She didnt write it with the intention of winning the pulitzerFor those who commented on her ideologies or how nazism is portrayed Hello She was  And maybejust maybe its justified to think the way she does considering she LIVED it unlike so many of us who get to sit back on our comfortable sofas and critically analyze every XYZ thing in the worldI believe no one has the right to review much less criticize a written document of a  year olds life who made it through the worst of circumstances and through difficulties we cannot even imagine to live throughIts a pity some people think the way they doEDIT th Sept I never imagined I would garner so many likes for this review This only means that a lot of people are emotional about this book and take negative reviews as a personal insult I wrote this review in a very emotionally charged mind frame A year later now that I am older wiser and more mature I realise I could have used fewer exclamation marks P   Why do we write reviewsYou have a lot of reasons I guessBut for this review there is only one I am writing this for my conscience Ever since I have rated this book I always end up asking myself that have I rated it with something it deserved or was it just out of sympathy some call it pity voteReading other reviews although most people just rate it and proceed posed me with many other questions and also gave me idea of what people generally think about her and her diarySo Im going to start withDO WE DESERVE to review or even rate this book diaryYes it is a diary not a book And arent diary meant to be something personal Yes they are but it was Annes wish to get her diary published and she even went on to fictionalize the diary by changing namesWhen I started this book I knew how it would end and who doesnt I had the least of the expectation knowing that she was  years old but she just surprised me by the outlook she carried of life She thought and wrote over few such things that didnt occur to my mind until I read it but have applied throughout my life She at times made me laugh at times made me feel sad If she felt something her writing definitely made me experience it and thus she overcame my expectation by large marginI have read in lot of review that her thoughts were way ahead of her age Of course they were difficult conditions make you mature and responsible but there were also other people living under the same roof and in same condition the suffering had even effect on them I remember the letter exchange between two sisters at that point after reading Margots letter for the first time I realised Anne was still child among themSome say she could visualize herself and her thoughts and actions from different perspective and thus realise her faultThe thing with diary is that it is a lopsided view of the events She would write her thoughts and what she wrote of others were her interpretation of themI have it in my mind but cant put it in words and why should I Does it matter what kind of girl was she NO from me Last thing that occur to me is that many people found it uninteresting and tiresomeI liked it it couldnt get any better I mean they were in hiding for their life in a same house for two years without even opening the window they were not solving murder mystery I remember that when I was halfway through the book I would every now and then turn to the last diary entry and count the days that remained I felt very sad and depressed and it would have been the last thing to occur to me that it was uninteresting I was just taken by her wish to see the outside world again feel the fresh wind and to go to school but This is not a book to enjoy much we read it to gain the insight of hardships that people had to go through during this holocaust Through this book she give us best view of the worst of the world No one has ever benefitted from war all it gives is pain and miseryAll this being said there is nothing to review the book but accept it as written account of the vices of the warThe worst question that seemed to have been slapped across my face was Would this book have meant the same if Anne had survived the holocaust and lived to become old Would it have been famous as it is nowWell she didnt survived and with her ended answer to this question and no one can bring her back   I confess to feeling slightly voyeuristic while reading this It was constantly in the back of my mind that this was no ordinary novel or even a truetolife account This was someones diary Every page written in confidence each word revealing the thoughts closest to the heart of this young girl As a journalkeeper myself I sometimes find myself wondering What if someone else were to read this which causes me to wonder how much to filter my words But then isnt the purpose of a diary or journal just the opposite To record ones honest and unfiltered thoughts While reading Anne Frank  The Diary of a Young Girl I do not get the sense that there is any such filtering going on From the ages of  Anne lived an extraordinary life and quickly grew far beyond her years in her understanding and handling of a horrendous situationThere are surprises in this book No matter how broad or limited your understanding of the world events that threw Anne and her family into a life in hiding I had  before reading this  held the general assumption that Well it was wartime They were in hiding for their lives They must have been miserable all the time Who could possibly find anything good or redeeming in the confines of such a life In hindsight of course I have had to reconsider I found bits of beauty kindness and even humour popping up in the most unexpected places And why shouldnt I Arent our lives much the same Oh  were not dodging bombs and trying to sleep to the sound of gunfire at least not in Canada But we each of us are often faced with some sort of tragedy or travesty Sometimes we may have an entire bad year or longer And yet doesnt the buoyancy of the human spirit always shine through It is really tough work to be miserable  hours a day No matter how difficult or challenged our daytoday life we all have those little pockets of joy that arise and sometimes it is those tiny occurrences that make the rest of it bearableOn a personal level I found myself comparing Annes childhood to that of my parents After all she was only a year younger than my Mom and Dad I think back to stories theyve told from their teen years and it boggles the mind to think that at the exact moment my Dad and his brothers were tipping a cow Anne was in hiding on the other side of the world At a time when my mother was discovering makeup Anne was realizing that life would never again be so youthful so joyous and carefree as before the war A generation was losing its innocence but in very different waysI would recommend Anne Frank  The Diary of a Young Girl to absolutely everyone for I believe that it holds some truth or enlightenment for everyone I do not own this copy  it was borrowed from my daughters school library She will be reading it next She is  And you can bet that before long I will purchase my own copy for I will be reading it again someday soon   Honestly I just cant do it I cant bring myself to finish the book Ive tried three times already and each time I have been forced to put it aside Books and film about the Holocaust are fascinating but not this one Unfortunately I was not engaged and found I couldnt care less Ill have to try it again in a few years On the up side I firmly believe that Anne Frank had she survived the war would have grown up to be a marvelous best selling writer At the age of  her words are better than that of many modern day famous authors     For her th birthday Anne Frank received a diary she dubbed Kitty Shortly after her birthday with the fear that her older sister Margo may be taken by the Nazis the Franks disappear into the night and go into hiding It is through Kitty that Anne records her thoughts and daily life living behind a bookcase in the secret annexWhen I was younger I went through a holocaust phase before moving on to Harriet Tubman and slavery The funny thing is that Anne Franks Diary was not the first Holocaust book I read I think that was The Devils Advocate AnywayI soon became fascinated by the Secret Annex and the secluded life she lived for two years Unfortunately she and the other occupants of the Annex were betrayed and sent to concentration camps with only her father Otto Frank surviving The tragic thing not to minimize the inhumanity of it all is that Anne died mere weeks before liberation Annes dream was to have her diary published after the war and after liberation her father saw that happen making Kitty a time capsule to an unfathomable past View all my reviews on my blog She is too fond of books   "},
{"title": "Surely Youre Joking Mr Feynman Adventures of a Curious Character",
"isbn": "0393316041",
"author": "Richard Feynman",
"text": "Richard Feynman  winner of the Nobel Prize in physics thrived on outrageous adventures Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek cracking the uncrackable safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets painting a naked female toreador  and much else of an eyebrowraising natureIn short here is Feynmans life in all its eccentric glory  a combustible mixture of high intelligence unlimited curiosity and raging chutzpah This book of anecdotes is written in a very casual fun way that makes it easy to read The problem is that the author NobelPrizewinning physicist Dick Feynman is annoying All the anecdotes involve him discovering a hidden talent using it delighting others or himself if thats his real goal and then being applauded for it sometimes only by himself For example he discovers that hes a great artist musician safecracker and critic Everything revolves around him showing off and being somewhat of a jerk There were many times when I thought yeah buddy you think its funny but no one else does A few stories like this and its quirky but piled on top of each other its annoyingI cant really recommend this book Maybe mischevious selfaggrandizing guys would enjoy it but otherwise I suggest a pass   This book was a pure delight The subtitle Adventures of a Curious Character is spoton Feynman gave an amazingly human and honest view into his philosophy and take on life thought a series of storiesOne thing that struck me most deeply was his passion for learning new things You would think a worldfamous Physicist would just be passionate for Physics  but Feynman was curious about everything he saw He dabbled in art and was successful enough to have a show he joined a Brazilian Bongo group and competed with them he hung out in Vegas until he grokked gambling he spent time in strip bars in Arizona until he figured out how to pick up women he cracked safes in Los Alamos for fun  the list goes on My take you should have your passions  but you should also have your hobbies I think I need a new hobby I really enjoyed his lessons learned from observing the Brazilian educational system He noted that many of the students were simply memorizing words and formulas and had no understanding of the concepts they applied to I think this is not a unique problem in educationAnother lesson learned from Feynmans studies of science is to never take any data for granted Always always question the sources Whenever Feynman did an experiment he would regenerate many of the numbers on his own  even if they had been published in other places For many things we are and not just in science standing on the shoulders of giants The easiest way to be led astray is if those results were never right to begin with I think Feynman was in his heart a true educator and scientist with real integrity And I think it drove him nuts how many important decisions are made using unscientific principles This book was a lighthearted attempt to point that out  not to mention a very entertaining read     The title of this collection comes from a tale that took place early in Feynmans career where he was invited for an afternoon tea with the dean of his university The deans wife is serving and asks him the above question Richard never drinks tea and never moves in the same society that does little own the society that has lemon OR cream with it A big theme of these stories and indeed a running theme in Feynmans life is that he had no time for formalisms rituals or societal views He does attribute a lot of this to his upbringing His father was a uniform maker and often dealt with clients of all types of notoriety and he knew that underneath all those uniforms were just another naked ape He passed on his views to his children and Richard went so far as to nearly not accept his Nobel Prize To him it was another form of bullshit and that his reward had already been awarded with other scientists using his findingsIts no argument that Feynman was a brilliant physicist but he also had many interests And a great proportion of these stories are about these interests or how his interests intersected with his physics work There is only one story in this collection that is technical in any way The collection reads as if you had somehow run into Feynman in a seedy bar in s Vegas theres a story about this time waiting for a showgirl to finish work He is a great orator and the origins of these stories are that they were recorded and transcribed by Ralph Leighton a drumming pal of Richards Yes Feynman played the bongos So while you have this brilliant man in some ways ahead of his time in the ways that he thought and how he acted there ares some hints that he is a man of his time Reading these stories you come to realise that Feynman was quite the womaniser He appreciated the female form in a socially acceptable way for the time that he lived in And so when someone from the twentyfirst century reads this book he can come across as a bit sleazy I am not going to defend his attitudes nor am I going to condone them Personally I found nothing overtly offensive about his actions or his attitudes But I can imagine my partner reading this and sighing at several statements made by him The book covers times in his childhood right up until late in life There is a nice large chapter on his time at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project There are also stories about his time in Brazil and Japan and his love for immersing himself in a different way of life There are also a couple of great chapters on education one about the standard of students he sees while in Brazil and the other concerning a time when he was asked to be on a panel to decide high school texts for his school region Id recommend this read to most people It is extremely accessible with little jargon or technical physics It talks more on his philosophy of living learning and how to deal with the world around you He is definitely a great orator and that is why his legacy lives on This book remains a popular seller in the general sciences and recordings of his lectures and interviews are popular on youtube Its great to know that we still have so much of him aroundAnd for those who want more there are plenty more collections of his wisdom There is also Feynman a biographic graphic novel   Feynman is a physicist who taught at Cornell and Princeton worked on the Manhattan Project and won the Nobel Prize Hes also a complete hoot The book is a series of autobiographical stories  pranks pulled as a student at MIT and at Los Alamos teaching himself to paint scientific discoveries he made his three marriages how he was rejected by the draft board for being mentally suspect they asked him if he ever heard voices and he said yes he did and then went on to describe what he found interesting about that He said that sometimes when falling in and out of sleep hed imagine conversations with his foreignborn colleagues and the voices in his head spoke accurately with their accents  but that if he tried to imitate such accents he could not do so at all So how was it that one part of his brain had captured accents correctly but another hadnt This was entirely typical of Feynmans wide ranging curiosity and intelligence but the end result in this case was that the psychologists decided he was nuts His colleagues at Cornell were vastly amused by thisWhat I love about Feynman  first of all his great interest in everything and his willingness to experiment The great joy he found in working things through he said that the reason hed never tried drugs though he was tempted was that he enjoyed thinking too much and didnt want to risk that Also hes clearly so very intelligent and reading his book his thoughts seem so easy to follow  it makes the world of science seem accessible   You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be Its their mistake not my failing  Richard Feynman Surely Youre Joking Mr FeynmanIve been circling this book The Feynman Lectures on Physics and Glecks Genius The Life and Science of Richard Feynman for awhile This one seemed the most fun and easiest place to start I was driving from TaosSanta Fe back to Phoenix last week and as I drove past Los Alamos it was just the particle collision in my brain I needed to start on FeynmanOften memoirs are hard to read because you know a bunch of it is faade A person is showing you a part of them for a purpose They want to be viewed as smart important funny etc They carefully guide you through a Potemkin village of their life Richard Feynmans memoir is different Not that I dont think Feynman had an ego He might have even had an agenda with the book But for the most part he seemed much more interested in the stories he wanted to tell rather than on how they would make him look He wasnt all that worried about how he looked so much His entire life was built around doing what he wanted exploring what he found interesting violating taboos beating his own drums and cutting his own path He was a Nobelprize winning polymath physicist whose other talents included playing drums teaching drawing naked girls picking locks making atomic bombs practical jokes and telling stories He wasnt interested in the usual trappings of success Many of those things annoyed him He was curious He was a risktaker He was a

"text": "Everyone has demons to overcome but Martin Fallon has more than most A ruthless hitman and executioner for the IRA Fallon is haunted by a mistake that led to the explosion of a school bus full of children  When hes threatened by the sadistic Meehan brothers Fallon must agree to one last hit But this time theres a witness a priest named Father De Costa And when everyone else wants the Father dead Fallon is determined to protect him to earn redemption from his life of crime and forgiveness for the blood on his hands In the s when Higgins still taught adult education in Leeds and was clearly styling himself on Ted Lewis he wrote some brilliant books This was one of them It got me reading as a kid back in the days when I hated school and ran away to join the army at  Sadly when Higgins moved to Gurnsey and started supporting Margaret Thatcher he lost something One of the great things about a Prayer for the Dying apart from its interesting allusions to the writing style of Graham Greene and the fact its a BRILLIANT story is that it isnt populated by real figures in preposterous scenarios trotting out expositional dialogue  a sad trait of Higgins more recent novels    Over the course of five decades he has used many names Martin Fallon is just one of them He carries a huge load of guilt for the tragic errors of his past As a soldier for many years in the Irish Republican Army  the military force known as the Provos  he was responsible for an uncounted number of deaths Now Fallon is a mercenary of sorts a gun for hireA tale of violence and redemptionA Prayer for the Dying opens in the city of Hull in the north of England early in the s In hopes of securing a passport and the necessary funds to flee the country Fallon agrees to kill the chief rival of a local crime boss and he carries out the assignment with cold efficiency Theres just one hitch standing just feet away in the cemetery where the murder takes place a Catholic priest witnesses the act Thus begins an intriguing tale of violence guilt contrition and redemptionA crime boss a killer for hire and a confessionSix principal characters figure in this wellcrafted and suspenseful thriller all of them fully fleshedout and interesting in their own right Apart from Fallon they include the ruthless crime boss Dandy Jack Meehan and his sexcrazed younger brother Billy the priest Father Michael da Costa a former soldier in Britains Special Air Service a British special forces unit the priests blind niece Anna da Costa and DetectiveSuperintendent Miller the veteran cop who heads the Hull CID The fourway relationship among these characters revolves around the inviolability of the confession in the eyes of the ChurchAbout the authorJack Higgins is the favorite pseudonym of the bestselling English author Harry Patterson Though Patterson has written  novels in a career spanning six decades he is probably best known for two The Eagle Has Landed  and A Prayer for the Dying  Both were made into major motion pictures although nine other Patterson novels were tooA longer than usual author biography of Patterson appears at the end of the novel and includes a number of photos of the author at various stages of his life At this writing he is  years old Hes a fascinating man the equal of any of his characters   Probably my least favourite of Jack Higgins efforts and I have read just about all of them over the years I first read it as a teen and have read it again a couple of times since While the characters are exceedingly interesting I found them underdeveloped in places and overly simplified in others Such great opportunity for more depth went begging Higgins has a great formula and for a quick pageturning Sunday afternoon time waster it does the trick However it is a long way down my list of his work that I would recommend Always surprised me why this one is one of the few they have dramatised particularly when they did such a woeful job of it    This book was short but it was mighty ExIRA soldier using the name Martin Fallon is pushed into performing a contract hit on a very bad mobster by another very bad mobster in exchange for a new passport new identity and a trip on a ship out of England for a new life His soul carries wounds from an IRA bombing gone bad A priest witnesses his contract killing but Fallon cant bring himself to kill the priest even though he has seen his face What follows is a painful journey for Fallon and the characters affected by his actionsHiggins created characters that resonate and though the book was written many years ago those characters are true to life and the story has a timeless quality The writing is nearly flawless and though short this book carries the weight in your heart that a longer work would carry I finished it last night and havent been able to get the story out of my mind  now that is the mark a truly great work    stars Read this thriller by Jack Higgins years ago and its stood the test of time in my eyes Martin Fallon is an interesting character An executioner for the IRA he is haunted by a mistake that he will carry for the rest of his days Hes contracted by the thoroughly evil Jack Meehan to murder a rival in England for the price of a safe passage When the hit is witnessed by the local Catholic priest Michael da Costa their lives become intertwinedIts a fast flowing story violent in parts filled with strong characters but it was the softly spoken tortured Martin Fallon that made this a keeper for me Its somewhat dated now but still an excellent read   "},

"text": "The worlds two deadliest spies in the ultimate showdown At a smalltown carnival two men each mysteriously summoned by telegram witness a bizarre killing The telegrams are signed Jason Bourne Only they know Bournes true identity and understand the telegram is really a message from Bournes mortal enemy Carlos known also as the Jackal the worlds deadliest and most elusive terrorist And furthermore they know that the Jackal wants a final confrontation with Bourne Now David Webb professor of Oriental studies husband and father must do what he hoped he would never have to do again  assume the terrible identity of Jason Bourne His plan is simple to infiltrate the politically and economically Medusan group and use himself as bait to lure the cunning Jackal into a deadly trap  a trap from which only one of them will escapeFrom the Paperback edition After three grueling months I finally finished reading this book You may ask yourself If it was so grueling why did he finish it at all Good question After reading the first two books in the Bourne trilogy I felt compelled to finally see the final confrontation between Jason Bourne and Carlos the Jackal Now I will admit that The Bourne Ultimatum was not nearly as boring and convoluted as its predecessor The Bourne Supremacy However Im fairly certain that Robert Ludlum took a class on writing ridiculously bad exposition dialogue before completing the series The characters never say anything the least bit natural or believable in the entire book and every conversation seems to include one character saying to another Im not following you after which the speaker tediously explains their prior explanation about unexplained government conspiracies in an inexplicable fashion Hey Robertif your characters need the dialogue reexplained so that your reader will have the slightest clue what the hells going onmaybe its time to write better Of course Ludlums dead so we know he cant read this Just like I could barely read his book If the book had been about  pages shorter it would have at least been fastpaced and fun but at over  pages it was incredibly overblown and repetitive Its a real shame because I loved The Bourne Identity Without the mystery of who Jason Bourne is and why he knows how to be such an amazing superspy theres nothing to draw you into the story Stay away unless you are a hardcore Ludlum or spythriller fan   What can I say It was intense  a little too intense for me By about the middle of the book I wanted to shoot Carlos myself just so that the insanity would end The plot in this book seems even more complex than in the other two and is impossible to comprehend Nevertheless I cared about Jason Bourne enough as a character to stick out the whole grueling story with him but I felt almost as beat up and emotionally raw as he did by the time it was over Overall not a pleasant reading experience but if youre a diehard Bourne fan you cant really pass this one up    As the Ludlum portion of the Bourne series comes to an end with this book I must say that this is surely a very thick in all its senses book filled with great nuances Completing the original trilogy at a time when spy games were all about actual deception and sleight of hand rather than technology and the information highway makes these books stand out for me That said Ludlum is as he is accused of being overly verbose in some areas and really could have watered down the description and yet still come out with a great book While Bourne comes up against his greatest nemesis yet the famed Carlos the Jackal the book has the reader traipsing all over the place to ensure the Bourne family is safe and then hunting the Jackal until he can be found The excitement near the end made up for sections of very slow reading and kept me from putting it down While I admire Ludlum for his creativity it was at times a little too muchLudlums classics do portray Jason BourneDavid Webb in a certain way that will surely be hard to replicate in an era when technology is the key to the game Eric Lustbader the author who has taken over the series will surely be placed in some large shoes and it is now up to the reader to determine how well they are filled That said if we are to be realistic here Bourne was around  years old when this book took place set in  so he is surely aging over that time I suppose we shall see if the reader must suspend reality and allow Bourne not to age over the  year hiatus or whether Lustbader will pick up in the early s surely harder to do with technology being what it is in the espionage game these daysOne small thing I must mention in this book being a proud Canadian I picked up on Ludlums continual use of Mrs Webb Marie in all three books as being part of the Canadian Government She is in Book  from Ontario and lived on a farm In Book  she magically was growing up in the farming communities of Saskatchewan yet was still a Francophone Those who know their Canadian even Prairies geography will see the issue Then in this book we are back to tossing hay in Ontario Keep those things clear as there is surely a group of us who can tell and do pay attentionI must admit the use of numerous languages does bring the book alive The French is accurate and I can only assume that the German and Russian is also up to par Makes the reader feel as though we are actually IN these places that are being discussed There my asides are completeKudos Mr Ludlum and thank you for setting the foundation for a great series I do wonder if Lustbader will Hollywoodise your work from now on That said I am eager to dive in to see how the postLudlum BourneWebb holds up   To be honest I was disappointed with this one I felt like finishing it  and the original trilogy  was an obligation after only a few pagesThe dialogue is ridiculous  nobody and while Im not familiar with American government institutions and their employees Im pretty sure this covers them too speaks in such a manner Every conversation is overly convoluted and then  as if for the sake of an uneducated audience  explained again as part of the same dialogue Not only that but the way in which the characters speak to eachother with regard to their feelings toward the other I used the word ridiculous already but it appliesThe plot isnt too bad Its actually something that could make a really good novel  revenge mixed in with international conspiracy and psychological trauma was indeed the stuff that made the first two novels bloody good reads However when you mix in the poor dialogue and easy fixes seriously everything that could be a problem from CIA equipment millions of dollars in funds incognito international travel is so easily sorted out and available it just lacks anything resembling substance The Bourne character  really the only reason I stuck with it to see its original conclusion  has sadly become a poor imitation of itself in this book Predictable trite and frankly a bit of a let down A shame a real shame    My rating is perhaps a little unusual for meas its not really based on literary merit Indeed I found myself upon this reread a little shocked at how often Bourne makes mistakes and is mentioned to be getting old Still its one of the first adult novels I really read and got into and for that it has a special place in my heart William Dufriss narration of this work so enthralled me at the time that I played the tapes several times over  no small thing considering they ran for over twentyfive hours and even reading it myself now I find I hear his voice and his charactersI especially liked the way Ultimatum made homage to Identity the section back in France was very nicely done if a little rushed And again I can only further iterate that the way Bournes age is brought up time and again makes the subsequent novels even more pointless than many have intimated The final sentence of the novel ends the trilogy perfectly and as far as Im concerned thats how the series should have remained   "},

"text": "It is the spring of  and the Nazis are eliminating all the witnesses to their horrible crimes including Jews and foreigners remaining in the prison camps Kommandant Repp who is known as a master sniper decides to hone his sniping abilities by taking a little target practice at the remaining laborers in his own prison camp But one man escapes and becomes the key to solving the mystery of the cold calculating Kommandmant Repp and his plans for ending the warRepp was the master sniper whose deadly talent had come to the notice of British Intelligence as the linchpin of a desperate Nazi plot to reverse the fortunes of the Third Reich at the eleventh hour But what was the nature of the weapon that Repp was to aimand who was to be his last target Allied Intelligence officers Leets from the US and Outhwaite from England are dispatched to identify and abort his lethal mission And when they finally learn the truth the Second World Wars deadliest race against time is on A good read that could have been better The plot was excellent with enough wrinkles and surprises to maintain the tension There was also more than a dash of technology which I always like in any novel What I found lacking was a more rounded understanding of the characters particularly the sniper Why did he think as he did How did he become such a blinded nonthinking Nazi These are questions I hope to explore in the novel I am currently writing and I was disappointed not to get Hunters view   I liked this better than the last book of his I read Havana but not as well as the first Bob Lee Swagger book This has nothing to do with the Swagger characters that I could see Just a straight WWII yarn The narrative is d person  from basically  separate POVs a German snipers  an American Intelligence man who is tracking him I found the snipers thought processes pretty well done  scarily so His dedication hatred  motivations seemed very real Surprisingly I didnt feel that way about the good guys I dont think they were as well portrayed Hemingway makes another caricature appearance Hunter doesnt seem to like him much There was a lot of good action some of it surprising some sickening all of it fairly realistic It portrays the last days of the war pretty well I think Im no expert but it seemed right to me All in all it was an OK read but I dont think Ill bother again Id give it  stars   Stephen Hunters first novel from  His capability as a writer to portray events and people in a very firstperson you are there fashion is well above average His sentence grammar is also well above the norm for action or war and suspense novelsThis book had a very dark overtone With its focus on so many details of individual fighting action and on the topics of death camps at the end of WW it was not a pleasant leisurely read It was also very different from the shootemup video game type of action sequence novels so often seen today The writing has a very realistic earthy feelTheres a great deal of shooting detail which is accompanied by the blood and stench of dead bodies This book does not have an objective of attempting to glamorize snipers or localized firefightsOn the downside I felt that the German shooter operated too efficiently with far fewer setbacks than what might realistically be expected The only shortcoming came on the last  pages with the lead filled rifling in his rifle barrel I think that even a good shooter much less a top class sniper would have known of this possibility and seen the result in testing For example in a  shot sequence there should have been some misses as the fouling accumulated Yet the only person who seemed to be aware of this was the gun engineerdesigner who was killed before being able to report the condition Because of the barrel rifling and soft ammo the problem would have been consistent across tests of which there were several and everyone familiar with firearms should have been aware and checking for the problem In the case of the book overlooking the issue allowed the hero and sidekick goodguys to unexpectedly live to close their chase in the last few paragraphs after the reader was led to believe that they had been eliminated and failed   Let me put it bluntly  author had a great idea when he came up with the story for this book and then he completely failed in the execution of that idea You have all the components for a great story here  the mystique of snipers one last mission at the end of WWII and human hunt for a very clever and dangerous individual In a way the premise of the book strongly reminds of the classic Day of the Jackal only in different settingHowever Stephen Hunter doesnt come even close to the classic of Frederic Forsythe His characters are dull and never awoke my interest Secondary plots that are intended to bring them to life are pretty pointless some of them can even be described as pure filler text because they have nothing to do with main plot The worst thing however is that even the main event isnt very interesting and I doubt that anybody would notice it if it had happened for realSo basically its a quite disappointing book Luckily Stephen Hunter gets much better in his later efforts  I would for example strongly recommend Point of Impact to any reader that likes technothrillers and snipers as a plot device But if youll give Master Sniper a pass then you wont be missing on much   Although Ive been reading Hunters film reviews in my local paper for years Ive never picked up any of his books However I have a soft spot for WWIIbased thrillers so when I stumbled across this first book of Hunters originally published in  I figured Id give it a whirl Set in the waning weeks of the war in Europe the story concerns a topsecret Nazi plan to use their top sniper and a special weapon to eliminate a mysterious target Meanwhile an OSS smallarms analyst in London is given a scrap of information to check out a tiny thread that he cant stop pulling on which slowly but surely puts him on the trail of the German plot The book then follows a fairly conventional thriller trope as the Allied team races against the clock to stop the Nazis before its too lateThe resulting narrative has the unevenness you might expect from a first novel Some sequences are quite good and some are really flat some characters are decent developed others are stiff For example the description of the battle in Russia that turned the German sniper into a hero is outstanding But there is an extended section in the middle about an exhibition tennis match one of the supporting characters in involved in which has nothing to do with anything Parts of it are wildly over sentimentlized while others are distinctly coldblooded The plot also relies entirely upon a ridiculous coincidence which brings the American analyst into contact with the one person who can provide him with several crucial pieces of information Another big disappointment is the revelation of the target for this elaborate plot which left me entirely underwhelmed On the whole I suppose its a serviceable WWIIthriller but nothing worth seeking out unless youre a fan of the genre It does have enough bright parts to make me interested in checking out one of Hunters later books to see if hes ironed out the wrinkles in his writingNote The secret weapon at the heart of the story is basically an infrared nightvision device heavily based on the real Zielgeraet system developed for the Sturmgewehr  assault rifle and really deployed sometime in late  early    "},

matter of minutes six innocent bystanders  and Cavanaugh  are dead But when his body vanishes and his weapon mysteriously appears in Hartmans luggage Hartman is plunged into an unfathomable nightmare and suddenly finds himself on the run Meanwhile in Washington DC Anna Navarro field agent for the Department of justice has been asked to investigate the sudden  seemingly unrelated  deaths of eleven men throughout the world The only thing that connects them is a secret file over a halfcentury old linked to the CIA and marked with the same puzzling codename SigmaBut as Anna follows the connecting thread she finds herself in the shadows of a relentless killer who is one step ahead of her victim by victim Together she and Hartman must uncover the diabolical secrets long held behind the codename Sigma It will threaten everything they think they know about themselves and confirm their very worst fears This is my nth Robert Ludlum book but unlike those that Ive so far read this surprised me the most Why Its backdrop is the Holocaust And for those who know me or those who regularly read my reviews Holocaust novels have never fail to touch choose one grip wretch warm my heartWhat will you do if the Jewish father that you loved all your life and who people respected and pitied because he claimed to be a Holocaust survivor was in fact a Nazi torturer And you found out this ugly incomprehensible truth only now that he is already deadThis is the basic premise of the book Something that could have win him a Nobel like Wiesel Kertesz Agnon etcHowever this is a Robert Ludlum book This is said to be the last one what he wrote himself and completed before he died So there must be the Robert Ludlum ingredients One there has to be a secret powerful worldwide organization and yes you guessed it right it is called Sigma see the title and it is an organization founded during the last year of Nazis existence The group however is still operating nowadays and it is composed of the rich and famous people around the globe It controls the world economy and can influence presidential elections in many big countriesThen there has to be two agents a man and a woman who you think will fall in love because they are cute together This time they are Ben Hartman the surviving son of the dead father and US DoJ agent Anna Navarro They are both haunted by the Sigma tentacles so they run together in their quest to find out the truth about the organizationThe last quarter of the book is totally unexpected They went to the Austria Alps and found something sinister there that will totally make you wonder and regret why Robert Ludlum did not pass on his wallless imagination to the current herd of mysterythriller writers He was just one of a kind in terms of concocting books belonging to this genreI hope the Robert Ludlum estate continue to write and write books that are reflective of Ludlums intricate plots like this one   Well though theres a woman Anna Vavarro who works for US Intelligence its not really a spy novel though theres a wealthy businessman Ben Hartman its not a legalmoney laundering novel though theres a background of international intrigue its not simply about world domination as those whore following global governmental revelations would expect Its a simple murder mystery that uses the main themes as a backdrop nothing elseBut with a catch Motive There is none Until and its like the world we know is shrouded by the world we can never be allowed to know The Sigma Protocol is a pageturning dream of a read Ludlums books are so good because he just wrote crumbling ropebridge fiction and REALLY enjoyed what he was doing I blogd about my second reading of this novel this morning with specific reference to the eponymous Sigma SG of the title  httpmikephilbinblogspotcom   Yeah Ludlum is a famous author And I loved The Eiger Sanction when I read it as a teenager I know its genre fiction but I love a good escape so I thought Id give Robert Ludlum another tryI suppose its what its supposed to be fastpaced easy reading But I was expecting more Its not a total waste it must have been a lot of work to put together that many pages But come on its just not fair for a guy to get that rich for such basically mediocre writing and plotting Let me kvetch about three thingsMistakes If youre making that much money and getting that big an advance you owe it to your readers to get the basics right The publisher should be embarrassed at their own copyediting but given that many publishers dont do squat it falls to the author And if your characters are jetsetting all over Europe and the Americas  a lot of readers will have been there and  checking it out is taxdeductible So theres no excuse For example a sign in a French police station reads DFENCE DE FUMER Honestly Such things erode our confidence and make us suspect all sorts of geographical temporal and linguistic lazinessBranddropping Many of the characters are obscenely rich There is a fascination with these things and great wealth gives characters a plausible excuse to have access to specialized knowledge and cool stuff like private jets But please we dont need to be told at every turn that character xyz has a beautifullytailored gray pinstripe bespoke Savile Row suit or an Herms scarf or Volant Ti Super skisnone of which have any bearing on the plot except to tell us that the owner is tasteful and rich enough to afford it In Legally Blonde knowledge of clothes and accessories is part of the plot when you do not reach the standard of that screenplay youre in troublePlot Grandiosity I have complained about this before elsewhere Its a bee in my bonnet And of course all of these things are matters of taste But one of the things that makes say John LeCarrs works so terrific is that what the spies spy about never really amounts to much Its important to them but the Earth never quite moves Here well no spoilers but the stakes are very high indeed Ridiculously high To give Ludlum credit he does bring interesting moral dilemmas into play but they get buried rather than resolved    I first read a Robert Ludlum novel after watching The Bourne Identity movie I started with the Bourne series of books and was hooked If youre into thrillers I would encourage you to read those booksTHE SIGMA PROTOCOL is a stand alone story and has a captivating beginning as all thrillers should placing the hero in an untenable position right from the start From there things only get worse for the hero Trying to determine who the good guys and bad guys are is part of the fun for the readerLudlum does an excellent job of making you want to stay up a few minutes more at night to read the next chapter just to see how the latest wrinkle will unfold in the storyIf you like thrillers I think youll like this book   I didnt care for this Ludlum book as much as other ones I originally got hooked on Ludlum by reading his CovertOne novels The Sigma Protocol started out good grabbing my attention and pulling me in but I dont think the characters were realistic or compelling I also found the whole thing to be a bit of a stretch The biggest conspiracy in the history of the world is just a bit too much for me to swallowI will keep reading Ludlum my next book is the Bourne Identity I love the movies I will enjoy reading about a character who can handle himself in any situation   "},

contient que de vieux vtements tachs de sang  The Hanged Man of SaintPholien also published as Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets  begins with Detective Chief Inspector Jules Maigret following a French suspect in Germany one who commits suicide within the first few pages Maigret immediately realizes that without meaning to he has caused a certain Louis Genet to shoot himself in the mouth This terrible turn of event leads Maigret to try to discover more about this Louis Genet  who turns out to be traveling under an assumed name As Maigret tries to find out this mans real identity he stumbles onto a bigger  and older  crime To say more would be to ruin the mystery but let me say that of the four Georges Simenon novels Ive read this is the most unusual and the best The novel really shows Maigret as the unique officer of the law that he is Highly recommended    On a train journey Inspector Maigret espies a shifty nervous young man guarding a battered old suitcase with odd intensity Maigret judges the man suspicious and so follows him then at an opportune moment lets a strange curiosity gets the better of him and switches the mans suitcase for a lookalike Later though he witnesses the man open the new case and be so horrified by what he finds  or what he doesnt find  that he immediately blows his brains out But when Maigret opens the real case he finds that it contains nothing valuable at all just a stained old suitMaigret begins to investigate But this isnt a case where the Inspector is called in to meet a strange new crime but one loaded with guilt as Maigret tries to find out just how responsible he is for this deathThis isnt so much a whodunit then as a what the hell is going on crime novel The Inspector swiftly comes across a group of men who are connected to the deceased and are obviously covering up But what are they covering up And why is it so important that Maigret now finds his life in dangerObviously this is the kind of mystery which only exists in crime fiction No police force on either side of The Channel is going to hold their hands up to ever having a case like this But the lack of realism or the fact that its all building up to a stagey revelation scene doesnt impact how hard this novel hits Yes theres a huge amount of artifice but it feels like theres a real humanity at stake here So by the end were not just looking at the denouement as we sometimes do with Ms Sayers or Ms Christie for how cleverly the author has deployed the red herrings but actually feeling real human emotions and a surfeit of compassion Its crime fiction but its not crime fiction just about death  its about regrets and escaping your past and making sure that your kids are raised properly Its about people and its all the more powerful for it   Georges Simenon is the antidote to all those fussy little mysteries where everything is so clearcut and all the detective has to do is waltz between a few suspects until he or she finds the guilty party in a final dash of brilliance No there is a kind of Gallic fog about Simenons Inspector Maigret Maigret is French to a fault We start out Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets with a few very discordant facts and very little idea of whether a crime was committed or if so the nature of that crimeA poor unemployed workingman travels to Bremen with a cheap suitcaseOn a hunch Maigret follows him and at the station out of a sense of playfulness trades suitcases he has an identical oneWhen he finds out that the suitcases have been exchanged the workingman commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with a revolverWhat was in the traded suitcase Nothing but an old suit with bloodstains on itThere are four or five men who seem to come together at odd times when Maigret is around and they are obviously very put out with Maigrets involvement What does this French cop know Is he on to usAnd so it goes until Maigret discovers the facts of the case by a process known in French as dbrouiller or cutting through the fog This case like so many of Maigrets is clearly wrapped in some obscuring mists It is Maigrets stolidity and persistence which sees him through the smoke despite two murder attempts on him and outlasting his adversaries when he doesnt even know why they are his adversariesI love reading Simenons mysteries and this is one of his good early ones    When I lived in Neuchatel Switzerland for a couple of years while in high school I fell in love with Inspector Maigret and read most of the series in French My French being worse than dormant in my dotage I have been pleased to see the release of the Maigret stories for my Kindle and have added several Hanged Man was the fourth of the series Unlike most of the subsequent books its less a police procedural as technically he doesnt even has a case and more of a psychological novel resembling his nonMaigret stories Here Maigret has been traveling and watching a man senses something peculiar in his behavior He follows the man who then commits suicide This leads Maigret to pursue assorted leads in order to understand the motivation behind the mans suicide I wont give away more except to say the book is an interesting examination of guiltMaigret is such an interesting character He can adopt a multitude of persona from the bumbling ignoramus to the brilliant and insightful detective while being compassionate or cruel as the situation demands   An early Maigret that doesnt disappoint Simenon himself was a bit of an enigma and the way he writes Maigret in these early books probably tells you a lot more about how Simenon saw himself than it does about the man who would go on to star in over  detective novels And no more so than this highly enjoyable readThis is probably as much of a psychological study as Simenon could make his Maigret novels unlike his other work his roman durs Jules Maigret inhabits the lighter side of Simenons literature and whilst theres always somebody meeting a grizzly end and people behaving in a seemingly reprehensible manner these books are more often found to be almost lighthearted and populated by oddball characters the least of which is the charming often aloof always drinking and eating something delicious Chief Inspector MaigretAll the usual ingredients are to be found in this book but its the  page denouement that elevates this above the also rans and the swiftly written lesser Maigets in my opinion The confession of The Companions of the Apocalypse mirrors the reported events of the death of one of Georges Simenons boyhood acquaintances and armed with this knowledge it feels almost like a confession from the great writer And as close a one as youre likely to get from a man who consistently lied about himself even in his own memoirs I think the catharsis he enjoyed from writing this story is a major factor in the quality of the psychological insight to be found especially so early in the serieshis

"text": "The last live broadcast on Polish Radio on September   was Chopins Nocturne in C Minor played by a young pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman until his playing was interrupted by German shelling It was the same piece and the same pianist when broadcasting resumed six years later The Pianist is Szpilmans account of the years inbetween of the death and cruelty inflicted on the Jews of Warsaw and on Warsaw itself related with a dispassionate restraint borne of shock Szpilman now  has not looked at his description since he wrote it in  the same time as Primo Levis If This Is A Man it is too personally painful The rest of us have no such excuse  Szpilmans family were deported to Treblinka where they were exterminated he survived only because a musicloving policeman recognised him This was only the first in a series of fatefully lucky escapes that littered his life as he hid among the rubble and corpses of the Warsaw Ghetto growing thinner and hungrier yet condemned to live Ironically it was a German officer Wilm Hosenfeld who saved Szpilmans life by bringing food and an eiderdown to the derelict ruin where he discovered him Hosenfeld died seven years later in a Stalingrad labour camp but portions of his diary reprinted here tell of his outraged incomprehension of the madness and evil he witnessed thereby establishing an effective counterpoint to ground the nightmarish vision of the pianist in a desperate reality Szpilman originally published his account in Poland in  but it was almost immediately withdrawn by Stalins Polish minions as it unashamedly described collaborations by Lithuanians Ukrainians Poles and Jews with the Nazis In  it was published in Germany after Szpilmans son found it on his fathers bookcase This admirably robust translation by Anthea Bell is the first in the English language There were  Jews in Poland before the Nazi occupation after it there were  Wladyslaw Szpilmans extraordinary account of his own miraculous survival offers a voice across the years for the faceless millions who lost their lives  This is the first time I am reviewing a book that I have tried and failed to rateHow do I decide on a rating anyway Should I judge the prose the content the authors style of presentation his narrative voice the quality of the translationDo I even have the right to Awarding a star rating to this mans unbelievably harrowing and miraculous tale of surviving a war which claimed the lives of  million of his fellow brethren for no reason at all seems a more sacrilegious act than calling Infinite Jest a bad book on Goodreads So I choose not toWladyslaw Szpilman a pianist working for the Polish radio station takes us through the years of Nazi occupation of Poland and Warsaw in particular and the insensate violence that had the Jewish inhabitants of the city the ones who were fortunate enough to be spared the concentration camps living the most brutal and unforgiving of nightmares for a period of almost  yearsWladyslaw SzpilmanSzpilman writes with a kind of unnerving indifference as if this were someone elses tale of horrors he is narrating and not his own It is obvious that since he had written this in  immediately after the war his senses may still have been numbed under the influence of the barbarous acts he had witnessed through the  years of the Occupation His voice doesnt sound sarcastic debilitated or even a little bit acerbic Instead he gives us a neat uncluttered unemotional chronologically ordered account of events which saw him narrowly escaping certain death many many timesBut this is not just his story A surprise awaits the unsuspecting reader at the very end in the form of Wilm Hosenfeld a Nazi officer who saved Szpilmans life in the last few months of  An astonishingly mildmannered generous soul who not only kept the knowledge of Szpilmans existence a secret from the other SS officers but saved him from certain death out of starvation and the unbearable coldBut true to the nature of war which justifies countering violence with more violence Hosenfeld was taken as a prisoner of war when the Soviets finally recaptured Poland He was tortured to death years later  in some unnamed labor camp in the icy swathes of Stalingrad His tormentors were especially cruel with him angered by his claims of having saved the lives of many Jews and Poles during the Warsaw occupation Which of course was nothing but the truthWilhelm Adalbert HosenfeldIt goes without saying while reading this book I had no sense of time or any movement around me I had no idea whether it was still daytime or whether night had fallen Turning over the last page when I finally took note of my surroundings I discovered my pillow was halfwet with tears and that I had a dreadful headacheSome of the most poignant haunting and reflective passages of the narrative are in Wilms journal which was recovered years later and incorporated into Szpilmans memoir    A mere German officer seems to have had the moral strength to admit    And yet the great Der Fhrer in front of whom a vast Empire bowed down at one point of time could only choose the cowards way out by committing suicide in the end A million stars to the courage of Wladyslaw Szpilman who aided the Jewish resistance in the Warsaw ghetto disregarding the constant threat to his own life A million stars to his unflinchingly honest attempt at looking back at a terrible past A million stars for enabling the citizens of the world to read know and derive lessons from the story of his life A million stars to Wilm Hosenfeld for holding on to his conscience at a time when morality and compassion were in short supply And a million stars to the triumph of the human spirit So you see the correct rating of this book should be  million stars which is beyond the scope of Goodreads Wilm Hosenfeld was posthumously recognized as a Righteous among the Nations in  by IsraelPS This review maybe updated after I watch the movie   As always these books are so incredibly hard to read not just to read but to understand how these cruelties could have ever happened This book was different in that it was not only written by someone in Poland who survived the Holocaust but someone who probably only survived because of the help of a German officer Excerpts from this officers diary are included in the back of the book as are explanatory notes tying everything together The tome of the book is rather matter of fact since it is written right after the war it was explained that it was written this way because the author could still not quite come to terms with the massive amounts of cruelty and lives lostI never knew that although more Polish Jews were exterminated than elsewhere some three to four hundred thousand Poles risked their lives to save Jews After the war the author continued to play piano in Poland This was for a long time a banned book I am glad that now everyone has the opportunity to reads this story   I loved The Pianist for a number of reasons but the supreme reason goes to Wadysaw Szpilmans storytelling Szpilman writes down the struggles he had endured to survive when Warsaw was under occupation by the Nazis Wadysaw voice never grows bitter plus his emotions never twist to abhorrence and its why I find myself respecting him so admirably His story was in no means out of hatred or disgust His intention was not to spit political statements about WWII As mentioned on the title it was solely based on his extraordinary true story to survive when the whole of Europe went into chaos Not to forget it was about his determination to live long enough in the hopes to achieve his dreamWladyslaw Szpilman was a polish Jew born in Warsaw He had three siblings and two loving parents He was a talented musician growing up he studied in Chopin Academy of Music in Warsaw Poland and then attended the prestigious Academy of Arts in Berlin before Hitler was in power He then worked at a polish radio performing Jazz and classical music But at  the Nazis invaded Poland and developed a new general government which established a ghetto in Warsaw specifically for Jews Life for Wadysaw turned into a daily torture Hunger and illness sweeped every corner of the streets in the ghetto Senseless hate by the Nazis and unjustified death leads Szpilman to escape rather than await his death However survival behind the walls of the Warsaw ghetto proves to be as difficult as a rapid death   Szpilman out of all odds survived the six year war Considering all he underwent it did not leave him with a taste of vengeance and animosity I thought at first if I read more inbetween the lines then I would catch some slight repugnance towards the Germans but Wadysaw displayed none whatsoever I was not the only one curious about this so when the book reached the epilogue written by a German poet Wolf Biermann I finally had my answer which simply strengthens my respect for Szpilman  I will lastly talk about Captain Wilm Hosenfeld who I cant help but include in my review Captain Wilm at first really appeared as if something out of a fairytale  the bad guy aiding the enemy Hosenfeld helped Szpilman survive when he was closest to his death Captain Wilm Hosenfeld is very much a hero with his capability to clearly draw the line between wrong and right when countless other Nazis were utterly nave The book gives an extract from the diary of Hosenfeld His opinions are very matter of fact on how villainous the Nazi Germans were  Overall you mightor might not pick up The Pianist but if youre still interested in the story then the film version of The Pianist is also a great insight of Wadysaw Szpilmans survival     Ive read a lot about World War II but Id never fully grasped the complete destruction the utter devastation of the city of Warsaw Hitler was like a bratty child with a toy hed rather destroy than share with anyone else When he knew he was going to lose the war he ordered that Warsaw be reduced to rubble Among the ruins there was a Jewish musician named Wladyslaw Szpilman who had managed to survive for six years and a German named Wilm Hosenfeld who saved Szpilmans life one last time I read this entire book in  hours Szpilman wrote his account immediately after the war ended so you can sometimes feel that sense of urgency that need to pour everything out onto the page and purge himself so he could begin to recover and build a new life He had a long career as a performer and composer and died in The book also includes some excerpts from the diary of Wilm Hosenfeld He didnt personally kill or brutalize anyone during the war but he never flinched from the collective responsibility of the German people for what they allowed Hitler to do to the world It was later discovered that Hosenfeld had also helped other Jews during the war I hope he did finally get his tree on the Avenue of the Just in Yad Vashem    Hitler atamancou os ressentimentos da Alemanha derivados da capitulao

"text": "Georges Simenon writing autobiographically once confessed his desire to drop out of society to sever family ties and disassociate himself from his friends His empathy with misfits is reflected in Simenons police superintendent Jules MaigretWhen Maigret learns that a bums murder is in reality an assassination he becomes deeply involved in what without him would have been left as an unremarkable event Maigret must discover the identity of the man who had been living under the Seine bridge then find out why anyone would want him dead Who hit a homeless man over the head while he was asleep and chucked him in the Seine in midwinter and why What could anyone possibly stand to gain Is his socialclimber wife trying to get rid of him or does he know too much about something And just exactly what is the Belgian bargees problemThis installment is more of a psychological study of Inspector Maigret himself showing how he goes about investigating getting a handle on a case and the people involved He breaks precedent by discussing the case with Madame Maigret who offers a helping hand as well as a listening ear Not my favourite Maigret as I found it unsatisfying but then so did the Inspector Just goes to show that real police work is not always open and shut there isnt always a confession or even decent clues All right to pass an hour or two but not up to Simenons usual standard And Im not sure I would agree with the idea that no homeless people who sleep under bridges would ever ever steal from each other or ever be violent That premise certainly wouldnt stand up to scrutiny in my city and I wonder if it did in s Paris One of the few cases in which the film is much better than the book though the script is faithful to the novel the performances carry what is otherwise a bland and uninteresting tale   Maigret and the Dosser was first published as Maigret et le Clochard in  and translated into English by Jean Stewart This is a lesser Maigret which depends on an incredible coincidence for its plot structure The dosser of the title is the chief character a witness to a crime of which he wont speak and now the victim of an attempted murder Simenon is mainly interested in this character but is unable to develop his story except in a perfunctory way Yet it still takes the focus of the book away from Maigrets investigation and leaves the book without a centre The crime is extremely unlikely even for a routine detective story which this book is Maigret is unsuccessful in proving his case because it is all his own supposition without a shred of evidence and very fanciful indeed No wonder the man accursed sneers at him And Simenon seems unsuccessful in doing what he set out to do with the book which might have developed into a novel more successfully than remaining the basis for a detective story   MAIGRET AND THE BUMMAIGRET AND THE WINE MERCHANT by Georges Simenon are very much two of a kind Reading either of these classic Maigret titles takes us back to  and  Paris and what seems a much simpler time I read these just before and after the attacks of Friday the th and have considered what to write for almost two monthsThese books are a snapshot look into a past that never really existed In both Maigret and the Paris police seem part of a sleepy little village where the homeless are never attacked and where wives turn away from the affairs of their husbands In the first book a bum is left for dead in the Seine River but manages to survive the attack When questioned by Maigret he refuses to talk and the investigation slowly picks out the details of a life abandoned and the problem is solvedThe wine merchant is a nasty bit of work with an entire cast of characters who might have wished him dead but here again the slow deliberations of the inspector reveal the truth of the matterBoth now seem like a dream of a better time but neither is There has always been unthinkable violence lurking behind the scenes always an injustice waiting to be corrected and these stories are mere lullabies to help us sleep at night We still need these stories They are a part of the heritage of the world and a place to look when we seek heroes to help us through our days Inspector Maigret my be just a work of fiction but he along with a pantheon of those who seek justice have inspired tens of thousands to root out the evil of the world and set things rightAs in the story of the bum there are times when you must acknowledge you cant fix everything but it is the work the striving which sets the ideal   Una incursione di un occhio borghese nel mondo dei clochard di cosa sono diventati oggi di coserano dei perch alcuni di loro lo sono diventati e delle loro regole degenerazioni speranze vizi virt

is split and there is treachery at court Worse the vengeancemad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities He claims the Iron Throne There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre Ironically they often write the most predictable books of all as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini Though Im not sure why they protest so muchpredictability is rarely a death sentence in genre fantasyThe archetypal story of the hero the villain the great love and a world to be saved never seems to get oldand theres nothing wrong with this story when its told well At the best its exciting exotic and builds to a fulfilling climax At the worst its just a bloodless rehash and the worst are more common by farPerhaps it was this wealth of predictable cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different Unfortunately being different isnt something you can choose to do any more than you can choose to be creative Sure Moorcock wrote Elric to be the antiConan but at some point he had to stretch out and find a core for his series that was more than just thatand he didIn similar gesture Martin rejects moralistic romance tearing the guts out of epic fantasy the wonder the ideals the heroism and with them the moral purpose Fine so he took out the rollicking fun and the social messagewhat did he replace them withLike the postMoore comics of the nineties fantasy has borne witness to a backlash against the moral hero and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him Hell if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes he didnt have to reject the staples of fantasy he could have gone to its roots Howard Leiber and AndersonLike many authors aiming at realism he forgets that truth is stranger than fiction The real world is full unbelievable events coincidences and odd characters When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real they make their fiction duller than reality after all unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitudeWhen Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance they replaced it with odd and exciting charactersthings strange enough to feel true In comparison Martins world is dull and gray Instead of innovating new radical elements he merely removes familiar staplesand any world defined by lack is going to end up feeling thinDespite trying inject the book with history and realism he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist with pet albino wolf Apparently to him grim realism is Draco in Leather Pants This produces a conflicted tonea soap opera cast for an existentialist filmTheres also lots of sex and misogyny and walltowall rapenot that books should shy away from sexor from any uncomfortable unpleasant reality of life The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it and it seems to plague every mainstream fantasy authorTheir pen gets away from them their own hangups start leaking into the scene Its not about the characters anymore its the author cybering about his favorite fetishand if I cyber with a fat bearded stranger I expect to be paid for itI know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do like night elf hunters humping away in WOW but reading Goodkind Jordan and Martinits like seeing a Playboy at your uncles where all the pages are wrinkled Thats not to say there isnt serviceable pop fantasy sex out thereits just written by womenThough I didnt save any choice examples I did come across this quote from a later book  Imagine the process Martin sits hands hovering over the keys trying to get inside his characters headOkay Im a woman How do I see and feel the world differently My cultural role is defined by childbirth I can be bought and sold in marriage by my ownOh hey Ive got tits Man look at those things go whooshing mammary sound effects Okay time to writeWhere are the descriptions of variouslysized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdlydetailed clothing There are a set of manboobswhich perhaps Martin has some personal experience withbut not until book five Even then its not the dude being hyperaware of his owntheyre just there to gross out a dwarf Not really a balanced depictionIf youre familiar with the showand its parodies on South Park and SNLthis lack of dongs may surprise you But as Martin himself explained when asked why theres no gay sex in his books though there are gay characters theyre not the viewpoint charactersas if somehow the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control Apparently he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author sorry none of my characters chose to be gay nothing I can do about itAnd balance is really the problem hereif only depict the dark gritty stuff that youre into thats not realism its just trying to hide a fetish If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape but the same thing never happens to a male character despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women then your gritty realism card definitely gets revokedThe books are also notorious for sudden pointless deaths which some suggest is another sign of realismbut of course nothing is pointless in fiction because everything that shows up on the page is there because the author put it there Sure in real life people suddenly die before finishing their lifes work fantasy authors do it all the time but theres a reason we dont tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things they are boring and pointless They build up for a while then eventually lead nowhereNovelists often write in isolation so its easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere your story is always a fiction Any time you treat it as if it were real you are working against yourself The writing feels the most natural is never effortless it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that wayA staple of Creative Writing  is to listen to how people really talk which is terrible advice A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition halfthoughts and nonspecific words stuff thing as to be incomprehensibleespecially without the cues of tone and body language Written communication has its own rules so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play Its the same with sudden character deaths treat them like a history and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable Like in an action film they are a plot convenience kill off a villain and you dont have to wrap up his arc You dont have to defeat him psychologicallythe finality of his death is the great equalizer You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right because hes the only option leftLikewise in Martins book death ties up loose threadsnamely plot threads Often this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs which makes them rather predictable any time a character is about to get enough influence to make things better or more stable he will die Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the plot will first be built up and then killed offI found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths  Hes not talking about the internal motivations of the characters or the ideas the characters representhe isnt laying out a wellstructured plothes just building up a character then killing them to defy expectation But the only reason we think these characters are important and expect them to succeed is because of how Martin sets them upHe treats them as central heroes spending time and energy on them but it all ends up being a red herring so he can get rid of them for a cheap twist Its like the mystery novels of the s when all the good plots had already been done so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapterits only surprising because the author has torn up the structure of their own book and with it the relationship between author and readerAll authors begin by writing plot arcs that grow and change building tension and purpose Normally when such arcs end the author must use all the force of his skill to deal with themes and answer questions providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers have watched growOr you could just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him That way you never have to worry about closure you can just hook your readers by crafting a new arc from the chaos caused by the dissolution of the previous one Start to make the reader believe that things might get better to believe in a character then wave your arms in distraction yell and point look at that terrible thing over there and hope your audience becomes so caught up in worrying about this new problem that they forget that the old one never actually resolvedBy chaining false endings together you can create a perpetual tension that never requires solutionlike in most soap operasplus the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started If an author is lucky they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up Its easy to idolize Kurt Cobain because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee RothUnlucky authors live to write the Final Book breaking the spell of continual tension and expectation that kept their readers enthralled Since the plot has not been resolving into a tight intertwined conclusion in fact its probably been spiraling out of control the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly leaving fans confused and upset Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguelyspiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tackedon climax actually hell probably do it anyways with dragonsThe drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end the story fundamentally leads nowhereit winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs But then doesnt that sound more like real life Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy and in doing so rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions Perhaps we shouldnt compare him to other writers of romance but to HistoriesHe asks us to believe in his intrigue his grimness and his amoral world of war power and deathnot the false Europe of Arthur Robin Hood and Orlando but the real Europe of plagues power struggles religious wars witch hunts and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countrysideUnfortunately he doesnt compare very well to them either His intrigue is not as interesting as Ciceros Machiavellis Enguerrand de Coucysor even Sallusts who was practically writing fiction anyways Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history but those are the same histories that lent Howard Leiber and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield even Tolkien had his EddasMore than anything this book felt like a serial melodrama the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with being drawn in by emotional appeals the hope that things will get better in this dark place tragic deaths even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism and in the end there is no grander story to unify the whole This grittiness is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of glory with one of hardship and despite flipping this switch its still just an emotional appeal Heroes always win is just as boring and predictable as heroes always loseIts been suggested that I didnt read enough of Martin to judge him but if the first four hundred pages arent good I dont expect the next thousand will be different If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories you get  pages including introductions end notes and variant scripts If you take Martins first two books in this series you get  pages Already less than halfway through the series hes written more than Howards entire Conan output and all I can do is ask myself why does he need that extra lengthA few authors use it to their advantage but for most its just sprawling undifferentiated bloat Melodrama can be a great way to mint money as evidenced by the endless variations on a theme of Soap Operas Pro Wrestling Lost and mainstream superhero comics Plenty of people enjoy it but its neither revolutionary nor realisticSome have tried to defend this book by saying at least Martin isnt as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy but saying hes better than dreck is really not very high praise Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all pointing to my lowstar reviews of Martin Wolfe Jordan and Goodkind but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authorsA lover of fine wines winces the more when he is given a corked bottle of vinegar a ballet enthusiasts love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition and likewise having learned to appreciate Epics Histories the Matter of Europe Fairy Tales and their modern offspring the fantasy genre I find Martin woefully lackingTheres plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there from its roots in epic poetry to the Thousand and One Nights to the early fantasies of Eddison Dunsany Morris Macdonald Haggard and Kipling Then there are more modern authors Poul Anderson Moorcock MJohn Harrison Vance Susanna Clarke Neil Gaiman Mervyn Peake China Mieville Phillip Pullman Howard Lovecraft and LeiberThere seems to be a sense that Martins work is somehow revolutionary that it represents a new direction for fantasy but all I see is a reversion Sure hes different than Jordan Goodkind and their ilk who simply took the pseudomedieval highmagic world from Tolkien and the bloodandguts heroism from Howard Martin on the other hand has more closely followed Tolkiens lead than any other modern high fantasy authorand I dont just mean in terms of racismTolkien wanted to make his story realnot realistic using the dramatic techniques of literaturebut actually real by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story Over the span of the first twenty years he released The Hobbit the Lord of the Rings and other works while in the twenty years after that he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories he filled his shed with a bunch of notes which his son has been trying unsuccessfully to make a complete book from ever sinceIts the same thing Martins trying to do cover a bland story with a litany of details that dont contribute meaningfully to his characters plot or tone So if Martin is good because he is different then it stands to reason that hes not very good because hes not that different He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style but thats just one small corner of a very expansive genre Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the father of fantasy doesnt know enough about the genre to judge what originality meansSo if Martin neither an homage nor an original Im not sure whats left In his attempt to set himself apart he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy but failed replace it with anything worthwhile There is no revolutionary voice here and there is nothing in Martins book that has not been done better by other authorsHowever there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do kill the longrunning High Fantasy series According to some friends of mine in publishing and some amusingly onthenose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview Martins inability to deliver a book on time combined with his awful relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy serieseven from recognized authors Apparently Martin is so bad at structuring that he actually preemptively ruined books by other authors Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings   Though I declined to finish this book Ill leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue onIf you need some kind of closure avoid this series No arcs will ever be completed nothing will ever really change The tagline is Winter is Comingits not As the series goes on there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other even as it increasingly becomes just

LogicI HATE this bookI HATE it so much I had to get a new hardback copy to read so I could underline all the parts I HATE about it so much and post them on GoodreadsI HATE it with such a passion I also bought copies for all my friends and family also in new hardback editions so they could HATE it along with meWhen the TV series came on I was so fuming with rage I watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the DVD because I could not believe how much I could HATE somethingI had spent so much time discussing how much I HATE this with all my friends who HATE it too and who all bought copies I decided to get a George RR Martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my HATRED for his work is There was such a collectivity at the timelike everyone uniting in HATING this togetherthat some of us formed relationships in HATE I met my wife at a George RR Martin convention and we got married as one of the characters reciting parts of the book for our vows and paid GRRM all our life savings to come read from his HORRIBLE book We HATE this beyond belief Maybe one day well read a book we like and the author can get rich on LOVE   I really feel the necessity of a bit of personal backstory here before I start the review Back in  when this book first came out and I was about  or  years old I saw the hardcover on a sale table for about  and couldnt resist a bargain still cant though Im more cautious these days So I started reading this book with the vague idea that it was a flop and that may not have helped but I got through  pages of it before feeling so crapped off with it that I shoved it in my cupboard and tried not to think about it Page  to be exact More on why laterIf youve heard of this book or read it youre probably aware that far from being the flop I assumed it was at the time and I didnt know anyone who was reading it the series has gone on to be one of the big Cash Cows of the fantasy genre Computer games roleplaying games  theres even a board game that looks like Risk Sooner or later therell be a movie or something no doubt Im moderately surprised one isnt in the works already People love this book and this series So Im well aware Ill probably be lynched for this review because even the people on Goodreads who didnt like it still had great things to say about itBut reviews are subjective and heres mineIn the vein of Tolkein Jordan Elliott Goodkind Hobb Eddings Feist et al A Game of Thrones is set in the classicly boringandoverdone medievalEnglandesque setting and is essentially about a bunch of nobles fighting over a throne Great Very original Praised for its focus on political intrigue its lack of magic and similar fantasy tropes and its cast of believable and interesting characters I found the book tedious The first epic fantasy series I read after Narnia was Jordans The Wheel of Time series and its true that I struggled with the first book Eye of the World But there were elements to it that I liked characters who I felt attached to enough to read the second book and become hooked and so on I love page long fat fantasy books I love huge casts of characters and have no problem keeping up with them Ive read Jennifer Fallons Wolfblade trilogy and Second Sons Trilogy both of which are heavy on political intrigue and very low on magic and theyre supurb A Game of Thrones is not It offers nothing new to the genre and does nothing original with what it hasNarrated in turns by Eddard Ned Stark Lord of Winterfell his wife Lady Catelyn his bastard son Jon Snow his very young daughters Sansa and Arya his middle son Bran Tyrion Lannister a dwarf and brother to the Queen and young Daenerys Targaryen last of the line of dragon kings and exiled to the land beyond the narrow sea the book is divided into neat chapters headed by the name of one or the other so you know exactly whose pointofview youre going to get and where you are in the plot Thanks for holding my hand Martin but I dont like this technique The chapter headings Im referring to It encourages me to start wondering about the character before Ive even started reading CATELYN the chapter title reads is she young or old a peasant a farmer a daughter a mother nice mean I start imagining things and then have to correct it all as the character is revealed during the chapter Theres power in names and withholding them or putting elements of a characters personality first is often more compelling and better writing It also made it harder to get through the book because at the end of one chapter Id see the name of the next think oh great himher again their storys boring and put the book downLet me be perfectly straight I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting though Jaime Lannister had something about him you hardly ever saw him They all pretty much felt like the same character just in different situations The differences between them for example the goodgirl Sansa and her tomboy sister Arya felt forced superficial and clichd Ned is all about honour and duty but especially honour with love a more minor consideration but honestly could the man be more stupid Eddards a moron and dull and his only saving grace is that hes nice to his daughters Lets be clear about something else right here this world and its people are so sexist and misogynist its ludicrous There are many derogatory references to womens tits metaphors about screwing whores descriptions of Daenerys getting her nipples pinched by her horrible brother Viserys  not to mention her marriage at twelve to a horselord whose men rape women like theres no tomorrow incest and so on The first time I tried to read this book I was offended and disgusted it didnt help that Id read Pillars of the Earth not long before though I did not grow up sexually repressed or prudish or anything like that I have never found reading descriptions of rape to be all that easy especially when theyre treated so dismissively  yet oddly my impressions of the characters were much more favourable I read it now and I just felt contemptNo one character stands out though Arya has potential Catelyn is as boring as her husband and her sister Lysa is lets face it mad as a hatter and a sure sign of why women are unfit to rule a clear message in this medievalesque patriarchal world Queen Cercei too Tyrion the dwarf seems on the verge of having charisma but fails and Daenerys I want to like someone but Martin doesnt give his characters any depth Sure theyre all flawed and a flawed character is a great literary device  the antihero etc But Martins characters are walking clichs even the dwarf The plot is also pretty weak I dont need elves and magic and dragons  in fact I tend to avoid them especially elves yawn  but youve gotta give me something else A bildungsroman does wonders  yes let me see the characters on a journey of life rather than a quest quests are tired Theres no quest in A Game of Thrones and thats fine with me But what is there Jon goes to the Wall that separates the wilderness from the Seven Kingdoms why is it called the Seven Kingdoms when theres only one kingdom and is attacked by an Other a kind of zombie creature Ned goes to the capital to take up the role of Kings Hand because the King Robert likes to spend his time boozing whoring and hunting Catelyn follows to tell him someone tried to kill Bran Ned tries to discover why the previous Hand died And swords with names seriously whats with that Im so sick of such blatant phallic symbols and their representations and the whole creed of honour and duty and gallant knightsWhat frustrates me most is that this could have been a really interesting story if only the author had better talent at writing characters  or letting them write themselves The plot is not the problem though its largely uneventful with no climactic moments because even those are written at the same pace as the rest with no drammatic flourishes come on we all like those lets be honest But the characters sigh their motivations are simplistic their actions extremely predictable and while they dont blur one into another neither do any of them stand out Also the type of setting seems mostly convenient with the focus on the nobles and their squabbling you dont learn much about the lower classes or what kind of food is grown here or what kind of industry supports the economy or anything about the cultures  using the clichd medieval England setting allows Martin to ignore one of the more fascinating aspects of society and leaves his world shallow like surface water without support using this old and worn Fantasy setting allows an author to get lazy about worldbuilding The history of the land is also riddled with clichs and sort of thrown in here and there as if to remind the reader it is a real place look heres what the First Men did As for the writing its easy to read and calm though very slow and rather lacking in tone or any interesting stylistic quirks flat and bland in other words Theres no atmosphere in this book Therere a few bad lines like A storm of rose petals blew across a bloodstreaked sky as blue as the eyes of death p  his one concession to drama it seems though if you read it again youll notice it doesnt actually make sense and a few awkward sentences that leave you scrambling such as Catelyn watched her son Robb Stark mount up Olyvar Frey held his horse for him Lord Walders son two years older than Robb and ten years younger and more anxious p I noticed a similar sentence later and I guess I know what he means but really its terrible writingOn the plus side there were a few things I liked The direwolves  large ferocious animals as constant companions and protectors always a winner with me the intriguing climate where summer and winter lasts years decades even before changing how does that work Seriously what do they eat Daenerys dragon eggs and the Dothraki the horse lords  though they were pretty superficial and confined to a rigid list of adjectives  I would have liked to understand their culture better In many fantasy books my problem is the whole good vs evil clich which generally involves the plot Here my problem is that the characters are so blackandwhite They are described good thats settled now what Theres no grey No character development They never once surprised meI honestly dont know if Ill read the next book The Wheel of Time taught me at the same age as I first tried reading this book  that the first book in a series can be the weakest because of the amount of extrapolation and background etc that goes on I didnt find that problem here it was very grounded in the now which makes me think the next book will be more of the same I keep coming back to the reasons why I struggled to finish this book boredom clichd and empty characters not enough balance as in theres no love in this book and if the characters are so realistic why dont they love and predictable events You know what it reminds me of Marion Zimmer Bradleys equally famous The Mists of Avalon  another book I couldnt finish If you like Arthurian fantasy and that kind of style then this would be a good book for you the excessively patriarchal culture the battles the hint of magic and something glorious lurking around the edges but never coming to the fore its all here neatly packaged Obviously it works for a lot of people But to all those people who say that Martin has opened up the genre in new ways that he is the best writer of the epic fantasy crowd and so on I have to wonder have they read anything else And then I wonder whether its a matter of which author you read first and grow attached to and so compare all the others I dont think I fell into that trap as such because Jordans lost the plot literally Goodkinds personal politics and propaganda have taken over his story and the one epic fantasy series that I love above all others  to date  is Kate Elliotts Crown of Stars series which I didnt start reading till I was in uni But I really wonder how this story grabbed other people If it grabbed you Id love to hear how and why because sometimes I feel like Im too jaded or something too snobby maybe    EDIT  Dec  I no longer get notifications for the comments Feel free to duke it out with each other just dont expect me to respondWARNING If you enjoyed this book even a little bit you may not want to read this review It will probably make you angry Heaven knows that the book made me furious and I intend to turn every bit of that wrath back on itInstead I suggest you read karens review Brigids review Joyzis review or any other of the gushing four and fivestar reviews here If video reviews are more your style I suggest Melina Pendulums vlog about this bookRealistically I know a lot of you are not going to listen which is why the edit is here At least it will slow you down a littleEDIT adding one more thing because despite the warning and the redirect links I kindly provided I have indeed gotten the kind of sexist bullshit comments I anticipated Before you launch into the usual defense therefore I give you thisAlternatively some fans may find it tempting to argue Well this media is a realistic portrayal of societies like X Y Z But when you say that sexism and racism and heterosexism and cissexism have to be in the narrative or the story wont be realistic what you are saying is that we humans literally cannot recognise ourselves without systemic prejudice nor can we connect to characters who are not unrepentant bigots Um yikes YIKES you guysSourceHeres the scoop on this review For a book that I hate I usually write a lot After suffering for several hundred pages I have pleeeenty of things to say Ive never hated a book that was quite as long as this one quite as much as I do so Ive had to alter my review so that I can say everything I want to without going over the character limitThe first part is an unorganized rant I marked pages with particularly annoying quotes on them for these rants I broke the book into segments of  pages and wrote up quotes and responses for each segment into separate blog posts These are all linked belowThe second part will be a more organized rant masquerading as a review MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A HATER REVIEW IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO CAUSE ME TO SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO BREATHE FIRE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS BOOKPart Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Part There are books I dont likeThere are books I And thentheres this book which did its level best to drive me to drinkingand I dont even like alcoholI wanted to like this I wanted it to be as excellent as so many people insist it is There are some books that I went into expecting them to be horrible but this isnt one of them Oh my hopes were high here  it was recommended by a plethora of great authors including the guys of Writing Excuses who I absolutely love Reviewers who I greatly respect rated it four and five stars and wrote at length about how awesome it was Other people praised the book as the greatest achievement of the fantasy genre so far and Martin as the greatest fantasy writer of all timeIts those last two that are most important I think because I love the fantasy genre  always have and hopefully always will Fantasy is what got me into reading well Harry Potter specifically and its been one of my mainstays for as long as I can remember I bought this book in large part because it was so often touted as if not always the greatest achievement of the genre one of the major works of fantasy published in our time Having recently read several works by Brandon Sanderson all of which were innovative highly readable and deeply philosophical I was excited to see what Martin by all reports an even better writer than Sanderson could do I expected my mind to be blown repeatedly and to be faced with the challenge of writing a review for a book so staggeringly brilliant that I could hardly think straight after finishing itThat is far far far from what I gotFirst of all this book is definitely not what I think of when I hear the word fantasy Its certainly far from my definition of high fantasy Now I realize that my definition of high fantasy which includes pervasive magic unusual creatures and a setting that is vividly far from the real world is not the definition youll find if you look the term up online I also dont care Seeing as the critical definition appears to characterize high fantasy solely by the fact that it doesnt take place on our Earth and as this definition is written as if high fantasy and swordandsorcery are mutually exclusive Im inclined to conclude that whoever wrote said definition is pretty damn stupid and carry on with my own outlines of what makes fantasy high low urban epic or any other subcategory or combination thereofThat said  this book High fantasy Not as far as Im concerned It is to say the least distinctly lacking in the requisite elements of the fantasticIs it possible that Martin is going for a the magic comes back subplot over the course of the series Definitely Do I give two shits about the rest of the series NOPEThis book comes off as a pathetic attempt at fantasy by someone who doesnt really care about the genre or doesnt know much about it It mostly struck me more as an alternate universe War of the Roses fanfiction with some hints of magic thrown in in a halfassed attempt to give it a place on the genre fiction shelves of bookstores You can explain to me over and over how Martin intended to make his world gritty and realistic and I will tell you over and over that that shouldnt matter that it is possible to have a fantasy which is gritty realistic and also utterly fantastical Its even possible to do it without losing the particular areas where Martin seemed to be trying for gritty realism since he chose to make all of his characters of the nobility anyhow he wouldnt have had to worry about overglorifying the lives of the peasantry as one might with a more economically diverse castNow Im willing to give Martin the benefit of the doubt a little bit on the possibility of the magic comes back thing because there did seem to be elements here that could become fantastical if fully explained later The problem of course is that theyre tossed out without background let alone proper explanation and so feel jarring and out of place  not a coherent part of the world but bits tossed in to be linked together later Right now all they managed to do was trip me up throw me assoverteakettle out of the story and leave me blinking at the page in confusion and not a little bit of frustrationAnd yeah maybe part of why Im so sore about this is that like I said I started this book not long after reading some Sanderson and Sanderson is basically the king of seamless fantastical elegant worldbuilding so pretty much anyone looks bad in comparison but stillIf I had to assign this book to a genre Id call it low fantasy because as far as Im concerned it was running too low on the qualities that make fantasy what it is Its about as much fantasy as fanfiction that translates characters to the modern day is  namely basically mundane with a miniscule twistThe characters of this book also stand out and not in a good wayThere are a lot of them  eight POVs and plenty more on the side  and not a single one of them is likeable They all had the potential to be which makes it worse Bran the Stark boy who learns too much and is crippled as a result could have an interesting arc if it werent so slow and drawnout The hints of genuine pathosinducing story are definitely there Theyre also present in the chapters focused on Catelyn who is the closest Martin gets to a truly nuanced character Ned Stark Catelyns husband is supposed to be the noble one  too bad his nobility comes off as stupidity instead Jon Snow Neds bastard child is a truly stereotypical fantasy character the super special outcast who is nonetheless generally loved except by those the narration makes a point to show as bigoted and cruel who never really has to work either for physical skills or personal growth and who gets gifted by the narrative with an absurd number of SUPER UNIQUE TRAPPINGS including an albino wolf really Martin REALLY Are you secretly a fourteen yearold girl writing horrendous anime fanfic or something Answer no and the comparison is insulting to fourteen yearold girls and a bastard sword that was a family heirloom of a noble house not his own Arya is by far the most entertaining of the Starks but only because she fulfills all sorts of rebelliousnoblegirllearnstofight tropes that Im quite fond of Sansas chapters made me set the book down for days on end she is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most insipid annoying airheaded character I have ever read and she has not a single whisper of a redeeming quality Tyrion Lannister is what Jon Snow could have become without the heapings of Gary Stu in his youth a bitter middleaged man with father issues who turns to sex and crudity as his only defense somewhat akin to Catelyn he had the potential to be interesting and nuanced if his behavior hadnt been played dead straightAnd theres one more Daenerys Targaryen Oh Dany Dany Dany I could write a dissertation on Dany and everything that went wrong with her story  but I dont have that kind of timeFor those of you not familiar with this most epic of George RR Martins characterization and plot failures here is a summaryoh and spoilers but I honestly cant be bothered to tag itWhen we first meet her Dany is thirteen years ond and about to be sold effectively into marriage with Khal Drogo a warlord of the Dothraki people by her abusive and notalittlebitcrazy brother Viserys Viserys has convinced himself that Drogo will help him take back his kingdom  this being the Seven Kingdoms where the rest of the book takes place  hence the whole selling his sister to be raped by married to someone he obviously sees as a barbarian thing The marriage occurs and then the wedding night in truly squicky halfdetail There then follows a long journey across the plains to a Dothraki city during which Dany is raped and no I will not call it anything else by Drogo By her fourteenth birthday she is pregnant When they arrive in the Dothraki city Viserys makes such an ass of himself that Drogo kills him by pouring molten gold over his head in the middle of a feasting hall Robert the current king of the Seven Kingdoms who the Targaryens see as a usurper sends assassins to kill Dany  naturally they fail  and Drogo gets so angry at this that he decides to commit all his people to attacking the Seven Kingdoms in retribution They leave the Dothraki city at this point Dany is heavily pregnant and go out to wreak havoc across the countryside on their way to conquest In one such battle Drogo is wounded because he refuses to care for the wound properly it gets infected When it is clear that he is going to die Dany appeals to an old woman to perform forbidden magic to save him the rest of Drogos people do not approve and try to cast Dany out End result Dany loses her child to create a Drogozombie which she then smothers When his body is placed on the traditional pyre she adds in three supposedly dead dragon eggs given to her as wedding gifts and which any fool could see hundreds of pages off were bound to hatch and surprise surprise they hatchTo which my primary objections are The blinding obviousness of the ending The fact that this single plotline  this single POV among eight  is so far distant from and so barely related to the others  The first two are selfexplanatory the third of course is the big thorny problem Now I can sort of understand the perspective which argues that Dany is taking control of her sexuality  she comes to enjoy sex and even to initiate and control it at times However SHE IS AT NO POINT OLDER THAN FOURTEEN Theres a reason that such a concept as an age of consent exists  there is an age at which teenagers are genuinely immature and probably shouldnt be making lifechanging decisions like say things that could get them pregnant Now I understand that in the medieval times like those that this book is based on girls were getting married and having children a lot earlier and that people in general were more mature at an early age However Dany shows none of that maturity until after shes been with Drogo for weeks  if not months When shes married to him she is if anything unusually innocent for her age Its a little hard for me to accept the idea that shes taking control of her sexuality when shes so young and clueless that her first sexual experience is a choice only inasmuch as she chooses not to fight back Not fighting back by the way doesnt mean its not rape particularly in the situation that Dany is in vastly younger than Drogo vastly weaker browbeaten by her abusive brother and told over and over that her obligation is to do whatever her husband wants Nor are her later sexual experiences ones of choice in fact it is explicitly stated that even when she had horrible saddle sores and could barely walk she was expected to be available for sex and treated as such If anything her eventual enjoyment of it seems more like a psychological block put up as a survival tactic than genuine pleasure in the act or love for DrogoYet despite the fact that this situation is obviously beyond a shadow of a doubt rape its never addressed intext If anything its portrayed as a positive experience for Dany one that makes her stronger and enables her to stand up for herself Stupid me I thought that the cancerous expansion of rapeaslove was limited to abusive jackass love interests in YA paranormal romances clearly I was wrong Its everywhere people We are all completely fucking doomedWhich brings me to one of the other major frustrations I had with this book the sex Ummm what to say I thought reading some of the Vlane bits of Darkfever while sitting next to my mother on the plane was uncomfortable to my utter shock that was nothing compared to reading the sex scenes of this book alone No worry about someone looking over my shoulder and reading about MacKayla Lane getting hot and bothered  and yet even more awkward Why Well as one reviewer put it and I wish I could remember who to give them credit theyre written kind of as if theyre these tremendous mythic events I cringe at the very thought of quoting them but to give you a little idea of what theyre like worst romance sex scenes youve ever read  bizarre flowerly euphemisms  gratuitous use of the word manhoodgeneral strange reverence for penises above and beyond the norm  incidences of incest  Game of Thrones sex sceneIn general AWKWARDJust to be sure you feel my painThis book felt maleoriented in a way that is so painfully forced that it made me distinctly uncomfortable I dont mean that women cant enjoy it  obviously as all the reviews I linked back at the top demonstrate they can and they do I mean that the book itself felt as if it were written for the most stereotypical male audience imaginable As Tatiana described it it reads like a soap opera for men Because MEN want lots of violence sex swearing by female genitalia and paperthin motivations right Which is exactly what Martin dishes upand so is the book hes producedI thought at around the halfway point that Id finish the book and be able to watch the HBO show to get the rest of the series without suffering through more awkwardly described sex scenes not to mention the rest of it By the time I finished though I had developed such a virulent hatred for this book its author and everything related to either of the above that I start grinding my teeth just reading praise for it Watching the show would be vastly to my detriment  mostly because neither my hand nor my bank account would do well after I put my fist through the screen of my laptopIn conclusionsummaryOh and to the diehard defenders of this series like those who were plaguing Keelys review who like to tell people who disagree with them that GRRM is the greatest writer of ALL TIME and that the female characters presented herein are feminist or to use an exact quote that GRRM has written some of the most independent selfreliant heroines ever to grace the fantasy genre Its more than half the reason hes so beloved His female characters disdain male attention are always smarter faster deadlier and braver than any of their male counterparts Kinda like feminists with swords which is complete and utter bullshit I have only one thing to sayTHANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT   yupnerds now i am among youthis is going to be a review where i just prattle on and on about meee meee meee because lets face it  there are a million reviews of this puppy out there so i dont have to worry about doing a disservice to the book youll either read the book or you wont but you should its got direwolvesi wasnt going to read this after years of watching hordes of desperate sadeyed nerds coming up to me asking any news on the george rr martin release like the bn computer knows more somehow than the internet it doesnt and i would have to tell them not without some schadenfreudeglee nope  it has just been moved back another year it gave me a solid sense of there but for the grace like when you see a very young junkie and you congratulate yourself for dodging that particular bulletdespite what i kept hearing about how awesome the books were i just filed it away in the mental RA folder of stuff nerds like and figured one day i would read them you know  for research but not before they were all out  i wasnt going to get sucked into the trap of so many before me  the waiting game of disappointment and having to reread the older books again and again to keep track of who was even alive at this point when you play the game of thrones you play to become frustrated and impatienti have seen it a hundred timesso when the teevee show came out and people were drooling over how good it was i paid them no mind i pushed it two feet past the someday pile in my brain because i am not one of those people who watch a movie before reading the book am ibut connor wore me down he really wanted me to see it and he wanted to talk to me about it and his bearded little face was all lit from within with enthusiasm and i just couldnt say no to himso i did it i watched the teeveee on demand  several episodes in a row pissed off if i started to get too sleepy to make it through another episodeso so goodso now i had to read it right i owe it to the gods of fine literature and allso i did and god this book is funi am glad they changed a few things for the filmed version  im not sure i would have been too comfortable watching a thirteenyearold actress play daenerys in the same line of thought  natalie  i know you have not watched the show yet but your crush on jon snow perfectly understandable to someone watching the show  he has that dark brooding thing i can see a girl going for but if you have only read the books girl your crush is on a fourteenyearold boy i have notified the authorities you pervin the end i am glad i watched the show first if only so that i know how to pronounce the characters names oh you crazy high fantasy novels and your namesalfonso wont read this series because of the incest and because they never tell you where the soldiers pooped i am not kidding several people complain that the seasonal imbalance complicates the growing cycle and where is all their food coming from this point i can understand  fantasy novels are supposed to care about developing a fullyrealized world and all and that is kind of a major detail but it doesnt bother me at all i am no connoisseur of fantasy i am a dilettante at best so i dont care where people are getting their food  i dont care if the social hierarchy is a realistic one given the particulars of this realm i certainly dont care where the soldiers are pooping nor do i care in any novel where and when the characters poop i just like this books quiet intrigues and betrayals the diplomacy the lack of hesitation when it is time for a character to be killed off i love how there arent any good guys or bad guys only effective and ineffective characters every one of them does at least one thing thatll make a reader go oh bad move so he dropped a few details when it comes to agriculture  he spent all his energies into creating characters that i love reading aboutthere are facets to this thing  sides of the argument rarely seen in a straightahead rollicking plotdriven novel and im not really sure where the misogyny accusations come from is it because women cant really ascend to power except through marriage because i dont think that was invented for this book  i am pretty sure that has happened historically in other places and if its the looting and raping well  that happens in war too wait is it sansa yeah shes kind of a wash but the girl wants what the girl wants shes at least more complicated than bella right there are plenty of good characters here that arent weak or powermad or just regularmad okay  there are a couple but sheeeeit  all the characters here are pretty bad on the moral spectrum right littlefinger is my very favorite but i wouldnt want to know him in my real life i appreciate his devotion thoughso i am super excited about clash of kings both the book i will read and the show i will watch swords and boobies and direwolves i dont even know how i am going to make it until thenoh because i was talking about boobies and HBO just there connor was telling me this story about louis ck and i loved it and i found this quote it is relevant hbo is nuditycrazy but he took care of their lust for fleshHBO was asking us why there was no nudity on the show and what they really meant was Why wasnt Pamela Adlon who played my wife nude When I hired Pam I didnt tell her she was going to be doing anything like that It wasnt supposed to be that kind of show So I said You know what Ill do it And I did that episode and they were like OK we have plenty of nudity thank youhbo thwartedlook dana i read one of your books and i have just discovered betterbooktitlescom   "},

Two great leadersLord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheonwho held sway over an age of enforced peace are deadvictims of royal treachery Now from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell chaos reigns as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest turmoil and war As a prophecy of doom cuts across the skya comet the color of blood and flamesix factions struggle for control of a divided land Eddards son Robb has declared himself King in the North In the south Joffrey the heir apparent rules in name only victim

Mother of Dragons risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent forgotten land of revelry and revenge wizardry and wartime It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide alchemy and murder the price of glory may be measured in blood And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steeland the coldest hearts For when rulers clash all of the land feels the tremors Audacious inventive brilliantly imagined A Clash of Kings is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantmenta tale of pure excitement you will never forget This isnt going to be a cutesy review I am well into the third book I fear that if I dont blurt out my thoughts about this one soon then all the books in the series are going to meld together in my memory Here are my three main impressions Bleak dreary and dismalDont expect any happiness in this book Martin is merciless with his characters And if you do see a bright light dont trust it One character learned she wont have to marry an abusive horrible guy She and I were elated Then someone pointed out that her exfianc could still rape her as he desires and few would be able to stop him Darn Eeny meeny miny moeIt occurred to me halfway through a big battle that I didnt know who I was rooting for The defender is a cruel king and has a tenuous claim to the throne but I like a few of the characters in his castle and feared what would happen to them if they lose The attacker would probably be a fair king yet he is cold and distant He has a better claim than most to the throne However I doubt he could hold it for long Precisely who did I want to win It was not a problem of apathy Martin drew the characters and politics so craftily that I just could not decide Honestly instead of picking I sat back and enjoyed the twists and turns Better keep upThe scope of the plot is everexpanding I give Martin kudos for having such a grand vision and keeping it all straight I dont feel that any of the storylines are unnecessary except I hate to say it maybe Aryas And I have complete faith that they will culminate in the most amazing way by the end of series Yet it is inevitable that you will prefer some perspectives over others I counted the pages in between Daenerys chapters  an average of  pages And this is a middle book There are no cliffhangers but very little is resolved If it is resolved that means someone died Unless they are only pretending to be dead of courseI lied One more point Awesomeness   WINTERFELLLLLLLobey your nerds is what i am learningsrsly  i was never going to read this series but once i started it is like a drug and  yes  i watched season two before i read this book but i am not going to wait for seasons  to read the next one no way because i am hooked and I MUST KNOW and if any one of you people spoils the third book for me i am going to make one of those torture devices with the bucket the rat and the torch and it is byebye stomach for youi see now why it takes him so long to write these things this is the densest and more fullyrealized world i have ever read martin just plants these little seeds and they sometimes take hundreds of pages to sprout but when they do  oh my word and there are so many little details so much backstory so many overlaps and connections and history and so much depth to this world it feels so genuine it is like my beloved donald harington  where he created an entire town full of people and then just set them loose and let them live their lives and his touch is so light that it feels like he is just writing down his observances of them rather than creating them because the mind simply reels at the idea that all of these details and tight storylines came from one persons mind but with martin the scope is so much bigger and it kills me there is just so much going oni loved the second season and i love how reading the book after the season really enhanced my enjoyment most of the show is faithful to the book but not as much as the first seasonbook but one is not better than the other i am sad that some of the bookthings didnt make it into the show and sad that some of the showthings were not in the bookbut together  ahhhh  my brainheart is pleasedthe characters whose stories changed the most from the book to the screen are view spoiler it is almost entirely changed for the showand view spoileri mean really  what could be better than every single one of these scenesview spoilerso i was sad it was not in the book at alland obviously all his stuffview spoilercuz he isnt even in the book robbed view spoileroh my god a pun hmmm more thoughtsat first i hated view spoilerbecause of his affectationladen dialogue but oh man did i ever come around and now i want one for my very ownand who is a worse human beingview spoileror view spoileri am still deciding but i am rubbing my hands in glee in anticipation of just desserts although martins sense of justice is very specific and unpredictable but a girl can dreamthe book is by no means perfect every time it got to one of view spoilers pov chapters i was all zzzzzzzzzzzzz because obviously the only perspective that matters is view spoilerwho is great in the books but somehow even better onscreen and everything withview spoileris wayyy better onscreen and since she is one of my favorite actresses i am glad she has a lot more to do than was written for her originallyand george rr martinso that is hardly a book review but there are a lot of reviews for this book and i am pretty much ordering you to go out and read these right now so just do it and stop your backtalk i leave you with this thoughtand this one because oh my god  what a perfect comparison that i somehow overlookedtwins my belovedsnow go readoh but ps  CHAINSgod i loved this bookbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   It was right about at the beginning of George R R Martins A Clash of Kings the second book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series that I admitted to myself that I wanted to quit my job and everything else in my life so I could stay home and read all day I resisted the urge Im still not quite sure if I made the right decisionYou think you know someone and then you read the second book about her Or him Though for the most part the changes of the hers were more exciting for me in this book Minus the most clever and entertaining character to waddle through the pages of a fantasy book who will go unnamed so I dont spoil the fact that he lived through the first book Okay I may have given it away a little Its not that the characters went through any unrealistic shifts its just that Martin let us get to know them even better and we got to watch how they responded to new situations Or at least I did You may not have even read A Clash of Kings yet Your loss I think enjoyed the first book more because the slow corruption of an innocent and stable world interested me But everything else that utterly enthralled me from the first bookthe complex and endearing characters the mystery and intrigue the moments when honor family love and pride all seem at odds with one anotherwas there in the second and was amplified because with each chapter I grew more and more invested Dont start this series unless youre ready to devote yourself to reading every published book of it I dont know what Im going to do when Ive finished the fourth book and have to sit around waiting for Martin to write and publish the rest That will be a sad sad dayQuotes Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath themHe who hurries through life hurries to his grave A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helplessWhen we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for himPeople often claim to hunger for truth but seldom like the taste when its served upTheres no shame in fear what matters is how we face itA man agrees with god as a raindrop with the stormWhen you tear out a mans tongue you are not proving him a liar youre only telling the world that you fear what he might sayThe best lies contain within them nuggets of truth enough to give a listener pauseOh to be sure there is much we do not understand The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands and what does any man see of life but a few summers a few winters We look at mountains and call them eternal and so they seem but in the course of time mountains rise and fall rivers change their courses stars fall from the sky and great cities sink beneath the sea Everything changesThe unseen enemy is always the most fearsome   If long Fantasy stories have fundamental rules they probably go like this  create a rich world  put interesting characters in it and  mix up some sequence of interesting things happening around them happening to them and being done by them Martins first novel in this series A Game of Thrones fulfilled all three swimmingly He forged one of the deepest Fantasy realms since Tolkien with a mythology culture and history He spun characters of a few key families and then scattering them throughout that world and by the midpoint getting nearly all of them into some form of political romantic or military intrigue Active scenes illustrated the world and put it into motion largely through political intrigue and the build to warThis second book takes a mallet to what the first set up dulling and dumbing down the world and putting the majority of the characters into boring or redundant situations where they do not escape the inertia of wasted prose until the final third of the book Where the slow build to great promise was acceptable in the first the sharp drop into bleak and sluggish chapters here is deeply dishearteningMartins prose drops off noticeably Fewer scenes generate atmosphere and often it seems downright immature with subJK Rowling lines like The shame of that hurt worse than the pain and the pain hurt a lot There is no language in this volume that rivals the blacksmiths metallurgy or the dragon eggs in the first leaving the thousandpage trek much less worthwhilePlotting and pacing have suffered similar fates The first book took a few hundred pages to get off the ground but then flew into character development and action divvied up between a dozen or so lives giving us a sense of a full and cohesive world The narrative is divvied up again here but with different results A couple of characters are in intense situations one girl poses as a boy heading to an army garrison with a questionable guide and the possibility of being attacked by the enemy at any time on her attempt to get home and a young soldier has gone to the other side of the wall and is risking facing creatures and perils never written about in the span of his homelands culture They should have this volume to themselves but instead we spend the first half waiting to hear more about them while we watch other characters sneaking into whorehouses and chatting about freshmanlevel theology Its especially annoying to leave someone hiding from enemy troops so you can read about some guy we havent thought about for hundreds of pages is getting a blowjob Martins approach to sex is perhaps more adolescent than in the first book and definitely has less appealing placement While the last third expands the number of useful and interesting roles the book has far too many chapters that serve as dull blockades to worthwhile narrative These lowaction chapters are not artistic or particularly expressive of original opinions The Song of Ice and Fire seems like a prime franchise to expand into semiliterary fiction but rather fumbles over clichs of sadness lust and nonsense that are all strikingly less immediate than the situations we leave to read about them We do not need another conversation about how some form of magic or divinity cant possibly be real Five or six of them will sufficeIt ties into a troubling sluggishness about this book The first book ended on the verge of war with one major battle having ended The second book ends on the very beginning of war with a whole bunch of people arriving It ends essentially on the same promise of future progress that the first did and has so much unnecessary material that I couldnt help looking at my copy of A Storm of Swords the page third book and wonder if it wasnt bloated by the same problems UPDATE Storms of Swords conquered all expectations and was the best starttofinish entry in the series so far To read about what changed you can click hereIt stings worse because the first book ended with so many promises  NEW READERS MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH We ended on the revelation that dragons are real and three fell into the hands of one of the most tragic characters In this volume they spend  pages doing little more than eat as were informed that theyre weak and helpless and serve only as an excuse for their owner to go to a couple of fancy places The revelation of the undead in the first book is even more underdeveloped here Even the other side of the wall turns out to not by a realm of nightmares or perils but more barbarians and sad people  a nice literary point but severely underwhelming in delivery There were so many things to look forward to but they dont manifestIn short Clash of Kings doesnt have much clashing and the kings do little of value It would have been more aptly titled The Sadness of the People Who Arent Kings but that wouldnt have sold as well   Everyone seems to agree that George RR Martin and A Song of Ice and Fire are titans in the genre of Epic Fantasy True true Everyone also seems to agree that the best characters are Tyrion Arya and Jon Snow They are indeed wondrous characters They are heroes They fail many times but in a way they are infallible they are so incredibly sympathetic they are always trying to do the right thing they have kindness  empathy  bravery  loyalty In fact nearly every voice in the first two novels is of this type the HERO Sansa is one exception  however she is a victim and I found her perspective to be very uncomfortable But I found the tale of the novels other nonhero barely even an antihero to be particularly compelling Theon Greyjoy Youre the bomb TheonThe kid is an asshole a smug and irritating asshole He thinks hes smarter than everyone else He makes plans upon plans that seemed based entirely around the idea that because he is thinking these thoughts they will no doubt occur He is arrogant beyond belief He has an annoying selfpleased smirk whenever another character describes him He is a rough sexloving womanizer and he strings girls along In the first novel he kicks around a decapitated head like a soccer ballFavorite Theon part getting a blowjob while thinking about how awesome his future successes will be And then he climaxes as he considers how his great deeds will even overshadow those of his dear old dad What a selfabsorbed asshole I couldnt help but laugh out loudAnd yet he has positive qualities too hes no cardboard cutout He has guilty feelings of loyalty He is brave and quickthinking and is no kissass His rapid response time saves a childs life Unlike his men he doesnt enjoy cruelty or barbarism and actively stops their occurrence He is thwarted repeatedly and never lets that stop him He sees no point in the grim vendettas of the old He is not as they say all bad In Theon perhaps the nurture of the Starks has had some slight impact on the nature of the GreyjoysI really appreciate that Martin included Theons voice because honestly reading walltowall heroic perspectives is enough to make me want to cut some throats Theon is an asshole but hes the kind of guy Id love to get a beer with shoot the shit and enjoy his various meanspirited bitching and selfabsorbed plans of conquest He is seriously imperfect quite unlike most of the other voices in the tale   "},

It made me root for the death of a child and then despise myself love a hated character cry angry tears and bite my nails because of all the suspensePictograhically all of the above was happening to meI did not throw the book across the room Instead I put it aside and stared at the wall for a few minutes in grief and disbelief If you read this you know which part I am talking about SOBBING Then I picked it up again because at that point I was so hooked that nothing could have stopped me I also MAY HAVE cut my neurobiology class to finish it I know Im bad very very badAh you guys Look at you all innocent before this book rips into youA Storm of Swords is in my opinion an undisputed high point of the series so far It expanded the story in delightful wonderful ways It gave it a truly epic

loved this book because of the amount of promise it brought to the series It brought our characters to the brink of greatness put them in the positions that were surely going to change the course of this entire story   Ah our favorite despicable Lannisters Look at you BEFORE all the hell broke loose for you Does it make you feel any sympathy for the Starks now No I thought soThe character complexity parallels the story complexity  both are done masterfully The characters feel alive and real They are interesting and fascinating and fluctuate between likable and despicable in a not too predictable fashion  The previously unseen connections between characters and events are mindblowing And seeing the select few skillfully manipulating so many others is unsettling  Let me use Jaime and Tyrion as my examples here Dont get me wrong I gush about it but this book is far from perfect Just like its sequels and predecessors it suffers from overload of descriptions and repetitions gratuitous bodily functions and banquets Some storylines already begin to drag Arya for instance But most of the faults were easily overshadowed by the great characterization masterful story and wonderfully built suspense This is what I felt was unfortunately missing from the books that followed and what I hope they return to eventually  brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   its time

who knows what it means to really really want to get some payback and now on to the next one   First Book A Game of Thrones Second Book A Clash of Kings I finally finished After months of reading despite that this was amazeballsSee I have this thing called bibliolangphobia which is a word I just made up that means I have a fear of long books Books that are well over  pages Yes I shiver I get paranoid I make sure Im in a well lit room and that my reading glasses are glued to my face Its a serious condition I rarely overcome my fears but with the A Song of Ice and Fire seriesits worth itThat should really tell you everything   this is the characters POV used in this book in one sentence or lessCatelyn Wind Wine WhineSansa But I dont want to marry an ugly frog I want to marry a

the only good one in Castle BlackTyrion Why am I always getting fucked overJaime Can I get a high fivePrereviewAnd so it beginsEvery year since I started GR I read one book from the ASOIAF series Hopefully at this rate I can actually read book  by the time its outI do not read further because I like being surprised while I watch the show Yes I do not like being spoiled and since I havent read on and since I dont have an FB I have not been spoiled nor plan to be spoiledCall me one of those lame people that read the books after the show makes it big or whatever the fuck you want The fact is I liked this show right when the first episode aired I didnt even know it was a fucking book Because I was  years old when the first one was published And even at  I wasnt that epically awesome to be reading it at that ageAND SOOOOOOOOO I will still ENJOY and OBSESS about it even if Im years too late so stick that up your pipe and smoke it   First an update on the Direwolf situation  I still do not have onesadfaceThis series  What can I say I am loving it I dont know if I was just sick of everything else or just needed the escape but I am soooooo enjoying The great thing is that I am on the third book and its not like I cant say which book I like better which was weaker they are one long story that come in threeso far for me packagesIts not like Indiana Jones Where we say man I love Indiana Jones but that second one WTH  You know with Kate Capshaw and her never ending shriek and there were monkey brainsDo you remember the monkey brains I remember the monkey brainsRefresher  I will make no mention of Indiana Jones and the skull of shit or whatever it was called because I have decided that Harrison Ford needed a new boat and it should not be included in the seriesAnyways A Song of Fire and Ice seems to different from the other series I have read cough Sookie Stackhouse cough I find them very refreshing and I never have any idea where its going or how he is going to get us therealso do not get attached to anyone cause George R R Martin be killing bitches left right and center No one is safeConfession time I seem to have a crush on The Hound  WHAT Shut up I dont want to talk about it  Whatever I am not even sure he is alivethe last time we saw him he was feeling a bit stabbed under a tree and I am not puting a spoiler tag on that cause if I dont know then I am not spoiling anything Maybe its cause he is so grumpy This series brings out some weird attractions my friend said she thought Littlefinger was sexy he is a quirky mother fker Ill give ya that also she did not judge my hound problem so were good   HAPPY SEASON  FINALE EVE NERDIES view spoilerwhat an awkward fathers day present for tywin success i have managed to read this book without getting spoiled ahead of time so  ha to you nerds talking loudly in my scifi section about the plot i ran to the history wall and hummed loudly until they left ha to that jerk at BEA telling his colleagues every single thing that happened in the third book while he stood behind me in that justin cronin line i made greg come back from his boothbrowsing and hold our place he has read all of these already and i scooted over to the chronicle booth and peered around the corner while greg stood in line wideeyed and kept making no it is not safe yet gestures and all i heard was the phrase view spoilerred wedding  ha to all you irresponsible but adorably enthusiastic teenage reviewers of these books with your spoilery status updates in my feed i have scrolled through quickly quickly and managed to remain completely untaintedand man there would have been a lot to get spoiled hereand now it is my turnHERE IS A LIST OF EVERYONE WHO DIES IN view spoilerokay so that was a tease and i would never be that much of a jerk but now i understand i feel powerful stuffed to the gills with knowledge and i am so freaking amped for season three to begin because i cannot wait to see some of these scenes played outbut apart from thati mean this is the third book in a series so what can i possibly say in a review it is difficult to talk about a middle book without spoilers and the casual goodreader isnt going to read this review probably because there has been so much content so much context that it would make no sense to someone who has never picked up a book in this series before i was rereading some of my thirdbook reviews for books that arent just a trilogy and you can see the strugglehttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhttpwwwgoodreadscomreviewshowhow do you talk about something that is continuing for people who have no idea what you are talking about so i assume only fans of martin are reading this and you people know how good this book is so what can i possibly say so im just going to whitter on about some things i likefeel like whittering aboutoh dana i am so sorry about that thing that happens to your beloved characteroblique spoilerview spoilerand in searching for that image i rediscovered this site that has way more content than it used to and i got sucked in for about an hourhttparrestedwesteroscomwhich led me to this which is a bookone spoiler so careful uninitiated friendsview spoilerit is worth a visit to scroll through their archives i had me some guffawsokay but there were a couple of things that i didnt like in this bookview spoilerbut those were just minor flaws in what is otherwise a great book george martin is good at a number of different things for epic fantasy which is usually defined by action sequences and the largescale his books are so skillful at the quiet moments dont get me wrong there are plenty of HUGE scenes in this book but there are also so many small conversations that are seemingly inconsequential to the overall storyline but they go so far towards character development which is something lost in a lot of genrefiction these characters are vivid and their decisions mostly  see gripe number  make sense in terms of their positions and ambitions and survival instinctsand they will affect youi started reading this while i was rewatching the first season of the wire which is an exercise i strongly recommend there are so many parallels in the way that characters operate within the parameters of the game and their individual codes of honor and behavior and in the rises and falls of characters that are predicated upon such seemingly inconsequential events the long drawnout causeandeffect situations they are masterful and span seasonsbooks which is such a delight to a fanwhich search led me to thisand oh god i love the internethttpasongoficeandwiretumblrcomis there anything you do not have internetthis book is everyones favorite but for me i think i like the second book better yet i understand the feeling people have for this the great love and the great heartbreak and  oh  the way he takes things we thought we already understood from as far back as the first book about jon arryn and about tysha and hes all nahhhh this is what happened for real so very cool just when you thought you had closureit is an easy series to get addicted to there are some problems for sure some of the writing occasionally can be cliched and there is some repetition that is a little tedious but overall this is a characterdriven series that has great scenes of action is genuinely

of A Song of Ice and Fire  silly readers im not sure ive ever read such a collection of resentful reviews for one book one reviewer just decided to repeat the same phrase over and over and over again sorry Joel had to say it another decided to note that kids are inherently boring Kids arent clever er wtf sigh i suppose i can understand the backlash Martin took a longassed time to put this out into the world and then  WHAT THE HELL  reader favorites Tyrion  Jon Snow  Daenerys have dropped off of this books radar but i am also perplexed  despite the loss of these wonderful creations this is an excellent and challenging novel come on readers grow a pair personally i savored this book from beginning to end the intricate plot the propulsive narrative the intelligent worldbuilding and most importantly the depth of characterization that were all hallmarks of prior volumes are still in place and undiminished in this installment one of the things that is often overlooked about Martin is that he is a brilliant writer of quality prose his descriptions are not just lavish they are often quite beautiful he has an expert grasp of language the man knows how to create imagery that is by turns stark subtly threatening strangely enchanting morbid nostalgic and ambiguous the only reason the novel does not earn a top rating from me but really who cares anyway is because of an unfortunately heavy reliance on repetition  mainly of key phrases and dream imagery still this novel should stand tall as an excellent continuation of this amazing seriesfirst and foremost A Feast for Crows is A Story of the Women of Westeros because this is set in a medieval land that has very little wish fulfillment in terms of rectifying gender imbalance it is fated by its own nature to be an unsettling and unfufilling narrativeCONSTANT SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Queen Regent Cersei Lannister is this series chief villain and so it was with much anticipation that i approached her POV chapters they did not disappoint quite unlike the POV chapters from her formerly villainous twin Jaime there is not much redemption coming Cerseis way shes such a fuckin bitch as the saying goes she remains cold grasping machiavellian murderous and extremely petty she is also incredibly entertaining a villain in the Grand Old Style full of swallowed rage and sweetlyuttered putdowns and viciously cruel schemes she takes to drink and she lets a fellow viper into her bed which also allows Martin to indulge in an enjoyably laugh outloud lesbionic interlude she makes a classic mistake in allowing fanatics to arm themselves in the end she literally outsmarts herself and is the victim of her own foul trap best of all she is going crazy her dreams haunt her dreams of her death and the deaths of her children much of her villainous nature is explained by these dreamswhat mother wouldnt stop at anything to protect her children and so Cersei doesnt stop at anythingbut what i mainly took away from her chapters were two important lessons that i learned oh years ago probably in my various college Gender Studies classes first a woman in power within a patriarchal structure is a woman in constant battle with her peers she will not receive the automatic respect granted to men she will have to earn it whatever that even means she will be constantly reminded that her job is actually to marry and to bear children and that her position of authority is somehow unnatural against the natural order of things i despised Cersei but i also despised those around her who did not give her the automatic respect a man would have in her position i appreciate that Martin made this inequity crystal clear he is against Cersei of course he is  shes the villain but he also gives the challenges she faces in her new position a rather timeless quality gender inequity is timelessand the second lesson a woman who gains power within a patriarchal system by mirroring the gender essentialism that supports that system has sadly sublimated that structure as natural and right  and will therefore enact that chauvinism Womens Studies  folks Cersei does not challenge gender imbalance  she supports it her interior monologues are full of the same bullshit as any sexist dumbass she despises weakness in men she condemns slutty behavior while indulging in it herself she uses classic chauvinistic tactics to bring down a rival and evenmoreclassic male brutality to destroy men and women alike as i mentionedshes a fuckin bitch but her character is a fascinating one to contemplateThe Sand Snakes and The Dorne Princess i suppose the chapters set in Dorne could contribute to many readers disengagement with this novel oh whatever i love Dorne Dorne is the ugly stepchild of Westeros matrilineal and distantly threatening with a great big chip on its shoulder but what a place it is aggressive and volatile sure but also a land where women are automatically given the same respect as men where a princess is the natural heir to the throne where bastards are not automatically disrespected the brief glimpses of the Sand Snakes despite their inability to start the war they craved were compelling in how differentiated they were in their various proposals to begin battle and i also appreciated how fallible Arianne Martell turned out to be a girl unused to schemes but still scheming away a seductress who fell in love a woman loyal to her friends and disinterested in cruelty an heiress and misguided leadertobe one whose time in the limelight approachesSansaAlayne and AryaCat sometimes a girl has to literally convince herself that she is someone else simply to survive sometimes a girl has to forget the parts of her that make her herself in order to achieve her goals of course in one case this is a girl who has lived her life as a pathosridden pawn in the other case we have a girl who is slowly losing her humanity as she becomes a kind of living weapon eh so what they both have my full support go Sansa  Arya go survive this series you can do itCatelynStoneheart and sometimes a woman fails to accomplish her goals to protect her loved ones to save her children i imagine that some women can get past this and can go on to define themselves anew and other women cannot or do not they swallow their bitterness but do not forget it becomes their fuel their purpose for being it can turn a heart to stone and um it probably doesnt help having your throat slashed at your brothers wedding and then being revived as a monstrous quasizombie and so Catelyn becomes a dread avenger and not a pretty one she is a killer without regard to reason or even justice and she turns Dondarrions Merry Men into a grim and bloodthirsty cabal i never thought id see Thoros be so sad so lost i never thought Lemoncloak could be such an uncaring asshole i never thought Catelyn would hang an innocent woman or a mere lad well i suppose thats what can happen so i know that Brienne survives thats obvious but if Podric Payne dies im coming after you George MartinThe Maid of Tarth i saved one of my favorite characters of the series for last i dont think Brienne is a lot of readers favorite i assume they find her constant integrity and her equally constant naivete repetitiousness and lack of imagination to be tedious but thats not how i feel i loved her from beginning to probably not her end there is such genuine realism to her loyal awkward lovelorn character she is a warrior woman but this means nothing in maledominated Westeros except constant and automatic disrespect she is i suppose physically unattractive and is constantly reminded of that by nearly every person she meets she is always Doing The Right Thing that integrity causes her to be disrespected even more and it often means nothing to the people around her well it means a lot to me her quest may have been aimless but it was also useful in illustrating the true and awful tragedy of war the lives lost the tormented survivors the bleak landscapes the sense of a world turned dark and bloody and soulless  a world without meaning seeing such a brave person travel through this blighted landscape and continuously stubbornly mulishly trying to do good was hard to read  but it was also what i really needed in order to truly connect with this novel a hero tried and true her two fight scenes vanquishing members of the appalling Brave Companions were awesome what a brave lady and what a unique addition to the fantasy genres Hero Archetype i love her as i loved this booknow on to the next one   The context here is everything A Song of Ice and Fire began with the publication of A Game of Thrones in  Thrones introduced us to the land of Westeros a continent the size of South America but suspiciously similar to medieval England We followed a handful of characters representing various factions of the Seven Kingdoms squabbling for the right to sit upon the Iron Throne Its grittiness tactility fullyrealized characters and high stakes a major character loses a head gave it a cult following Two years after Thrones A Clash of Kings was published It told the story of the War of the Five Kings Though it started slowly it built to a fine ending which included the shocking loss of Winterfell home to many of our main characters and the epic Battle of the Blackwater A phenomenon had started Like clockwork the third novel in the cycle A Storm of Swords came two years after Kings It was the biggest book so far and easily the best It featured all the hallmarks wed come to expect from author George RR Martin  swordfights detailed descriptions of food casual misogyny laughably crude sex scenes shocking twists major character deaths and a humdinger of a cliffhanger  but those elements were heightened There are set pieces in Swords that are simply classic see eg the Red Wedding At the end of Swords the fate of several major characters  beloved characters  dangled in the wind Readers thirsted for the next installment They began their wait And then crickets Nothing for five years After five years we were given the present installment A Feast for Crows By this time it was nearly impossible for any book to live up to the expectations of Swords On this level at least Crows did not disappoint It certainly met the expectation that it could not meet expectations As the old saying goes the only thing worse than a bad meal is a small bad meal Not only did Crows fail to meet the challenge of Swords it was over too quickly When readers got to the last page they were left to wonder this is it Martin you see had allowed the manuscript for Crows to get so long he decided to cut the thing in half As he explained in a nowinfamous postscript Martin decided to split the book geographically rather than chronologically That meant that many of the best characters did not appear none of the cliffhangers from Swords were resolved and we were left to follow the dubious quests of various secondary personages To make matters worse Martin tentatively promised the next volume A Dance With Dragons would be published the next year That postscript was written in  Six years later A Dance With Dragons was finally released Thus it is a fortuitous time to review Crows It is a muchmaligned book buffeted by two competing elements the long wait before the book was published and the longer wait after In other words the book has suffered critically because it took so long to come out and did not satisfy the pentup demand It also suffered because it did nothing to alleviate the long wait for Dragons Almost all agree that Crows is the weakest volume in A Song of Ice and Fire Beyond that opinions are split Some people hate it with the light of a thousand suns Some people love it like a pug dressed in a tuxedo Others acknowledge its weakness while admitting that a subpar steak is still a steak The length of time it takes Martin to churn out his opuses creates some high passion amongst his fans That passion combined with the internet and thousands of basements belonging to thousands of moms has created a great deal of hyperbolic ire directed towards Martin While this criticism is a minority report it is loud and has colored the merits of Crows I am immune to this misplaced anger I am a latecomer to Martins work accordingly when I started reading Thrones four books had already been published with a confirmed release date for the fifth Ive never suffered the long withdrawals between books that the early adopters have had to overcome Due to this tardiness I feel like I can judge Crows based on its literary qualities rather than its late arrival onto the Ice and Fire firmament Unfortunately the literary qualities of Crows are in short supply Most of Crows problems stem from Martins decision to divide the story by geography and focus mainly on the action in Westeros that takes place south of the Wall That means that the dwarf Tyrion Lannister Martins greatest creation is missing So are Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen Not only are you losing fantastic multidimensional characters with whom weve traveled for hundreds and thousands of pages you lose the heart of the story As far as I can tell and Im sure Ill be wrong Martins endgame seems to point towards two events the struggle at the Wall against the onslaught of the walking dead the song of Ice and Daenerys struggle to reclaim the Iron Throne with the help of her dragons the song of Fire Neither of those crucial points get any play in Crows Instead its  pages of BsideThe viewpoint characters in Crows Martins story is told in the thirdperson limited with chapters that alternate pointsofview among various characters are mostly new to the spotlight Jaime Lannister Samwell Tarly Arya Stark and Sansa Stark are the only returning viewpoint characters The other viewpoints go to Queen Cersei Aeron Asha and Victarion Greyjoy Areo Hotah Brienne of Tarth Aerys Oakheart and Arianne Martell Some of these characters are brand new Some have been barely mentioned Most of them are confusingly named it gets a bit tough keeping Arya Areo Aeron Aerys and Arianne apart at least for me unfortunately Im not able to devote my entire life to these books With some exceptions their stories do not rise to the level of interest or intensity as the plotlines of Martins earlier books The bulk of this book nearly a quarter of the pages belongs to Cersei Given space to develop her character Martin is his usual strong self Earlier in the series Cersei was a terrifying enigmatic peripheral character In Thrones she showed her smarts and her cruelty by getting the drop on Eddard Stark admittedly not the sharpest tool in the shed After the death of her son King Joffrey in Swords Cerseis transformation began She became more guarded paranoid and megalomaniacal Her descent into madness is marked by her growing certainty that all her decisions are correct The most interesting aspect of Crows is Cerseis long fall contrasted with the rise of a fanatical religious movement called the Faith Cersei is also beneficiary of one of Martins weird peripheralcharacters the the fallen maester Lord Qyburn Like Dr Frankenstein Qyburn toils away in the dungeons doing odd experiments on living subjects the result of which it is obvious to see will be halfhuman halfmonster Unfortuntately Cerseis chapters are disadvantaged by a subplot concerning Westeros outstanding loans to the Bank of Braavos All the talk of high finance and trade federations harkened uncomfortably to another famous fantasyscifi epic that lost its way Cerseis brotherlover Jaime has the second most pagetime His evolution from villain to hero takes a big leap forward as we see him go from murderous sisterhumper to a canny leader pushing back against the excesses of Kings Landing With Jaimes chapters Martin is able to tie up a few loose ends still dangling after the War of the Five Kings for example the dragging siege at Riverrun is finally concluded The balance of Crows is told in scattershot style through the ten remaining viewpoint characters We barely hear from Sansa which is fine with me Still it is nice to see that she is developing at least a semblance of wit I have a major problem with her character mainly because Martin portrays Sansa as a real child that is as someone who is uninteresting and dumb The problem with kids as characters is that kids are inherently boring Kids arent clever no matter what I see posted on Facebook Only in a book or movie is a kid who cant tie his shoes crafty enough to turn his house into a living version of Mousetrap to foil a pair of robbers So far Sansa is realistic in the sense that she is dull frightened mistakeprone and hollow This also means she is a weak protagonist In Crows despite a limited appearance she finally starts to learn some of the finer points of deception Arya Stark is a more traditional fictional child Despite her tender years she performs great heroic feats Her evergrowing darkness however makes her a joy to follow I wouldnt be surprised if at the end of A Song of Ice and Fire we counted her among the bad guys In Crows Arya is exiled to Braavos She doesnt do much of anything and her chapters seem meant only to explore the islands of Braavos This wouldve been fine if Braavos was interesting Instead its just Venice right down to the swaggering arrogant handtalking menfolk Three characters Areo Arienne and Aerys serve to give us entre into Dorne The set up here  the machinations of Dorne against Kings Landing  is obviously important However these chapters are rushed and the Aerys chapters are so short and abrupt I have a hard time understanding their inclusion The same goes for the chapters with the three Ironborn characters Aeron Asha and Victarion In perfunctory style they are moved like chess pieces put in place for further development down the road The chapters following Brienne are like walking on a treadmill Shes given a lot of space to do things but she never gets anywhere Martin has her crisscrossing the ruins of a wartorn Westeros searching for Sansa Stark Of course we know exactly where Sansa is therefore we know that Brienne is never going to find her Also for all her abilities she is portrayed as a slowthinker a female Forrest Gump whos handy with a sword Even if we didnt know where Sansa was hiding wed have a pretty good idea that Briennes plan to find her would fail it literally consists of her wandering around asking where Sansa has gone These are structural problems And forgivable as long as the books quality had been consistent Its not This is a poorly written book by Martins standards His descriptions seem tired His writers tics are more pronounced The dialogue which had been whipsmart and eminently quotable is execrable It is flat repetitive Jaimes I love you too sweet sister is repeated on a loop and filled with odd obtrusive neverbeforeused idioms For some reason the characters start referring to their uncles as nuncles even though uncle had served just fine before In one chapter the insult stoatish is used two or three times as far as I can tell it means weasellike and then dropped like a bag of flaming pooDespite taking five years to write Crows feels like a first draft There are brief glimmers displaying Martins mastery of both his world and his writing For instance even though Briennes deadend quest is inert as a narrative Martins evocation of a warweary Westeros is captivating with its fresh graves burntout homes and outlawinfested roads Subpar writing can be saved by a propulsive plot or a great set piece As I noted before the plot grinds forward Moreover nothing exciting happens Swordplay is kept to a minimum There isnt a battle to be found in a way Martins exhausted effort mirrors the tiredness of warblasted Westeros With the exception of Moby Dick I try not to use the word boring in my reviews Here though things get awfully close to the bword To be sure there are a few saving graces The first is the sex scenes They are just awful and bound to put a smile on your face The highlowlight is a lesbian sex scene between Cersei and Lady Taena that involves an unfortunate comparison of a womens nether regions to a swamp It had me laughing my ass off Martin is also able to add a few twists at the end including a cliffhanger that leaves one character dangling by the neck Here unlike in Kings a strong ending isnt enough to save the rest of the book To the contrary Martin should take lessons from M Night Shyamalan you cant rely so much on th hour shocks or uncertain character fates At some point A Song of Ice and Fire will be finished Either Martin will complete the saga or it will linger forever as a partiallycompleted neargreat thing When that time comes it is very likely that the esteem for Crows will rise Its faults will be less glaring its virtues will seem more virtuous Right now though I just want to move on to A Dance With Dragons and pretend Crows wasnt half as bad as I know it was    Im not quite sure what happened hereAs others have mentioned Martin slows the pace of the story down considerably in this fourth installment of A Song of Ice and Fire ostensibly writing this as the first half of a twobook volume with a  year production time on each As such the book is by necessity filled with unresolved storylines AWOL main characters and lengthy travelogues where nothing of importance happens Of course this draws the inevitable comparisons to another famous fantasy series that started strong and became a sluggish irritating morass something to do with wheels and time as I recall The pace isnt really the problem here though as the story still stands on its own two legs The problem is the writingThough the first three books were extraordinarily wellwritten as a whole one could never classify Martins prose as elegant In this book he takes three steps backward for some reason and sounds almost amateurish in some chapters The book is filled with phrases and sentences that are awkward clichd and sometimes downright hackneyed Martins prose may typically be spare and to the point but I never audibly groaned while reading the first three booksOne of the biggest problems with this is Martins sudden inclusion of colloquialisms that so far as I can tell never existed in the books before this one Cozs nuncles and valonqars abound even though weve never read any character use these turns of phrase before and be prepared to hear groats referenced multiple times in a single chapter This doesnt only present a continuity problem for those of us wondering why these dialect oddities are so suddenly commonplace Martin seems to have run out of patience for phrasing things differently so the exact same idiom often gets used ad nauseum I was weary of these invented clichs before I even truly understood what they meantBy now fans of the series thus far are used to the disturbing ubiquity of rape in Martins world but even that loses what little subtlety it had in this book with at least two characters being described as needing a hard raping another example of redundancy in Martins writing did that expression really need to be used twice in one book The consensual sexuality devolves in this book as well Martin uses strange fixations and bluntforce descriptions the comparison of female private parts to a swamp was the high point for me as it were which make them seem almost bizarre and therefore a lot more gratuitous than they were in the first three booksI gave it two stars instead of one because the standout elements of this series are still evident in A Feast For Crows despite Martins apparent attempt to sabotage them with clumsy writing The characters are multidimensional unpredictable and welldeveloped and the overarching story is fascinating enough to keep me turning pages However I am genuinely concerned about the direction of this series which has heretofore been my favorite fantasy series and often recommended to friends I dont know whats going on with Martins writing but I truly hope the next book returns to the caliber of the first three I would hate to have to do with this series what I do with Jordans recommend that people stop at Book  and pretend its an openended trilogy Id much rather dismiss this one as the mediocre volume and go back to enjoying the series Heres hoping   Dear GeorgeHow do you do this lovely May morning Im terribly sorry to bother you but I really did think that I must in good conscience warn you of this problem I have You see I know many people who read these books and absolutely adore them Legions of fans Im sure you know that Really the books are quite high quality and quite enjoyable and whatever you need to do to get them to stay at that quality please do it within reason It has come to our the masses attention that perhaps waiting three to four years between books is a bit excessive Dont you think soNow more importantly than the principle of the thing Ive noticed some very unhealthy side effects from these gaps in between the books Namely some severe mental complexes that are resulting in a personal hostility towards you I thought I had an obligation to warn you that I have heard of several imaginative plots that many of my fellow readers have dreamed up to get you to finish these books All of them involve house arrest most of them involve chaining you to your computer a few involve terribly cruel things with assorted war instruments like those you brutally describe in your novels Ive heard a few terribly distressing things along the lines of shoving a broadsword up his ass Im sure you can imagine the restNow while I dont think that people would employ such plans now I do notice that these mental complexes seem to get worse over time So who knows in the futureJust thought you should knowSo toodle pip hope that put you in the mood for writing These people apparently think that such things willA sincere fan   "},

"text": " years ago the greatest crime against humanity was committed Today its only a heartbeat away from happening againIn the pulsepounding tradition of Robert Ludlum John Le Carre and Frederick Forsyth Glenn Meade the acclaimed bestselling author of the blockbuster thriller Snow Wolf delivers unrivaled suspense unforgettable characters and a brilliantly absorbing story with a mindblowing surprise endingIn Paraguay a young reporter is found brutally murdered In Berlin a political activist is gunned down in the street In Strasbourg an international policeman is given the name of a beautiful young German woman and the first key to an extraordinary plot Joseph Volkmann knows that a string of killings around the world are linked by a single purpose And he knows that Erica Kranz whose journalist cousin had stumbled on the story is linked to the plot Haunted by the ghosts of the past driven by the specter of the future Volkmann and Kranz are about to plunge through a realm of terrorism fanaticism and deception as they stare at the true face of evil Brandenburg was first published in and it shows There is a  edition also for sale on Amazon and the reviews are extremely mixed with the same number of star reviews as star Its now been republished by Howard Books an imprint of Simon  Schuster that publishes Christian crossover fiction The cool  cover disguises the fact that the book is set in  and hasnt been updated either in content or in writing style In a way thats goodthe story just wouldnt add up if it was set in but in some ways its bad It would have been easier to get into the plot if it was made clear the book was set in  rather than leaving the reader to work it out through clues like references to CDs tape recorders phones with cords and the Times Atlas no Google Earth or Wikipedia in this universe And how do I know the book was definitely set in  It opens on Wednesday November  and it only took a couple of minutes on my phones calendar app to work out that November  was a Wednesday in   or  And  and  are too late for the technology described in the bookAnd whats Brandenburg about The blurb describes it as a British agent and a German woman find themselves unraveling a plot to bring about the Fourth Reich Maybe so but Joseph Volkmann and Erika Kranz dont discover what the plot is until past the halfway pointuntil then they are merely trying to discover who killed Ericas cousin a South American journalist who was chasing a story that had German connections My main problem with the plot is that it just wasnt thrilling I finished reading at the  mark when I realised I really didnt care enough about any of the characters to want to find out what happened at the end at a guess given that this was set in  and Berlin is still standing the good guys won A reviewer on Amazon said Meade doesnt give anything away until the last quarter of the book and this is what makes it intriguing Each to their own but I kept waiting for something to happen and I kept being disappointed On the plus side my housework got doneMeades writing is compared to Dan Brown which should have warned me off I dont like Dan Browns writing and I dont like Meades It goes against all the guidelines of modern fiction possibly because it was written before the guidelines were Its full of uninteresting narrative and long dumps of information that dont really seem in character the first conversation between Volkmann and Kranz was a case in point There is a lot of violence some of which is gore for the sake of it as it serves little or no purpose in forwarding the plot The thirdperson point of view flips between characters so much as to be confusing And not making the time period clear didnt help It has no Christian content at all despite being published by Simon  Schusters Christian imprintOn a more positive note Brandenburg is tightlyplotted although the profusion of cardboard characters that only manages to avoid complete confusion by focusing mostly on Volkmann If youre looking for a good modern Christian thriller Id sooner recommend Noel Hynd Don Brown who writes US Navy legal thrillers and shouldnt be confused with Dan Brown or Richard L MabryThanks to Howard Books and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review    This is my second Glenn Meade book and I enjoyed it very much I really enjoyed The Romanov Conspiracy This one takes place in present day but draws from the events of German WWII The evidence is sparse in the beginning and early leads seem to dry out The protagonist is not a Jason Bourne type but a son of immigrants who lived through the Holocaust He learned little from his father who was a young Jewish teen at the beginning of the war What he did learn was mistrust of Germans but particularly children of former SS officers Which is where Erica entersErica is a beautiful German woman whose first cousin was recently murdered in Paraguay He had hinted before her departure that he was working on a big story What she nor Joseph Volkman know is that eventually Erica would have become part of the mystery whether she had contacted the international police or not The players in the mystery are children of those who had made a pact years before There is a shocker in the story that the reader might see coming I did What I did not know until the end was if Erica was part of the plan or not It is a carefully laid out spy thriller Enjoyable read   I thought the plot was clever and story line quite entertaining I liked the character who turned out to be the protagonist although it took a while to establish his role in the story However the book could have been so much moreThe book was too long There were to many inconsequential characters which made keeping people straight difficult The author employed considerable violence and gun play in the story Unfortunately he knows nothing about either subject which causes his violence scenes to fall flat   and that is being kind The firearm related passages are so unrealistic that they border on the juvenile His dialog is reminiscent of Joe Friday speaking to people in the original Dragnet series It becomes so stilted in places that its humorous Still the story was entertaining and worth the read if you can get passed the shortcomings    I cant say I really enjoyed this book to be honest First off the writing style and use of language drove me insane One thing I kept encountering were sentences like Tell me what you intend doing Thats ones from page  of the edition I read While this may be correct in British English it sounds so jarringly wrong to my ear that I kept getting annoyed by itThe next issue was with the dialogue It was so stilted and characters kept addressing each other by name In general people dont actually use each others names a lot when they speak which is why beginner writers are usually cautioned against this Apparently whoever edited this book hasnt heard of that rule before  Now for the plotrelated issues The plot started off really interesting I liked the first bit that took place in Paraguay But then it just got boring mainly because I didnt really like or care about the main character Joseph Volkmann I get the idea he was supposed to be this somewhat troubled intelligence agent but the author didnt fully pull that offview spoilerAnd dont get me started on the utterly STUPID plot point involving Hitlers son First of all theres no real proof that Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal were actually romantically involved Dont get me wrong I really hate Hitler and think he was evil but Ive never seen definitive proof of this Eminent historian Ian Kershaw says theres no proof one way or the other and I agree with him on this But I digressSeriously this book is a bit long Save your time and read something else Trust me youll be glad you did I was so disappointed in this one that I dont know if Im going to read the other Glenn Meade book I got from the library The Romanov Conspiracy And anyone who knows me will know Im a sucker for anything Russia and Romanovrelated Something has to be pretty bad to make me contemplate passing up a book involving Russia and the Romanovsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   Glenn Meade in his new book Brandenburg published by Howard Books gives us a global conspiracy thrillerFrom the back cover A secret that must never be revealed

and Clint Eastwood also helped and it still packs twice the punch of most contemporary bestselling thrillers Whats more the cast of spooks turncoats and commandos who drive this story are more

de Al Doilea Rzboi Mondial Ma inut n suspans o noapte ntreagCartea aceast are  stelue din dou motive  pentru c la vremea respectiv mia plcut enorm i   stelue pentru c mia deschis pofta de literaturE ciudat cum am trecut apoi brusc de la MacLean la literatur de expresieAndrei Tama ianuarie    Im about to review a modern technothriller and while researching the author something jogged my  year old selfs memory of Alistair McLeanI gobbled his books in high school  I remember when The Eagle Has Landed was all the big rage and I read it sure like everyone else but Alistair had me hooked and I ploughed through his entire oeuvre or at least as much as our high school library budget allowed during one yearThen I forgot all about him until two days ago I suppose that will be another author that my adult self will have to ignore if I want to keep my five star memories intact   Had I reviewed this in my thrillerloving youth I would have given it five stars It is the adventure story par excellence the secret mission behind enemy lines carried out by a group of intrepid adventurers the snowbound castle up in the sky fights on the top a moving cable car and doublecrosses doubledoublecrosses and even doubledoubledoublecrossesHowever nowadays I find all such stories shallow the adventure rather juvenile and the Anglocentric view a bit nauseating Hence the three starsBut if gungho adventure stories are your thing you cant make a mistake with this   Alistair MacLean wrote the screen play for his close friend Richard Burton Burtons star power was sliding at the time of the film and he wanted an action film along the lines of Macleans bestseller and hit movie The Guns of Navarone And he got it The novel is in fact based upon the screenplay rather than the other way around  slightly oddI watched the film last night and I had to read the novel And it is the screenplay The first  pages are a bit slow since one really cant get the anxiousness of the team A team of British Special Forces commandos parachutes into the high peaks of the Austrian Alps with the mission of stealing into an invulnerable alpine castleaccessible only by aerial gondolathe headquarters of Nazi intelligence Supposedly sent in to rescue one of their own their real mission turns out to be a lot more complicatedand the tension climbs as team members start to die off one by one There are a few scenes that suspension of disbelief is necessary but they dont violate the viability of the story negatively MacLean understands how to write an action thriller and I would recommend Alistair MacLean to read any day of the week To give more of the storyline besides the book blurb would reveal the delicious twists turns and events that would destroy a readers pleasure     It was always going to be difficult to enjoy this book having just read and been astounded by the brilliant Submerged by Thomas F Monteleone As a youth I have fond memories of the boys own type thrillers by Scottish born Alistair McLean and on initial reading I recall that Where Eagles Dare was a first class pageturner Unfortunately revisiting this ndWW thriller after many years has not proved so enjoyableThe story starts off with a great flourish when Major Smith and Lt Shaffer together with their motley crew are sent on a perilous mission to the Schloss Adler a fortress high in the alps of Southern Bavaria There is initial intrigue when having parachuted into enemy territory one of the saboteurs is found murdered there is an enemy agent within the ranks We then proceed in a set formulaic manner as Smith and Shaffer proceed to infiltrate the fortress stronghold by means of a perilous journey on the roof of a cable car Their task it would appear is to rescue Col Carnaby before the Germans can interrogate him and discover the plans for the second front ie the expected imminent Normandy Landings There is lots of shooting and a final confrontation within the castle when the true nature of Smiths mission is disclosed This is followed by more shooting as our brave heroes depart the bloody scene amidst chaos and a smouldering fortress that is fast being destroyed by fire and turning into dust and decayThis is a clean easily assimilated adventure story suited to the minds and attitude of teenage boys emerging from a youth spent reading the adventures of comic heroes Batman and Superman It is not really a book to satisfy the intellect or demands of an adult reader due to its simplicity and soulless empty characters It is probably best remembered for the  movie starring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood with the immortal words Broadsword calling Danny Boy he said Broadsword calling Danny Boy Can you hear me Can you hear me It is also equally absurd as representing the German high command as bumbling fools who somehow allowed a small trained group of saboteurs to destroy a seemingly well protected impregnable fortress and as they escape are heard to say Gott in Himmel Theyve got awayPerhaps I criticize and reprimand a story that is simply there to entertain and not to be viewed as a well researched and informative thriller That may be so but in the final analysis I demand more from my reading than a routine adventure with a much frequented theme and a predictable conclusion   "},

the US Army  Approximately seven years in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve and seven years in the Regular Army I was eighteen when I enlisted in  and I was all about the action I had obviously watched too many Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone movies By the time I separated from the Army in  I had come to realize a few crucial things about the military and combat operations Beans and bullets logistics are everything The side that excels in running an effective logistical network might not win the conflict but it will probably at least ensure that when its time to pull out the troops theyll do it on their own terms See Iraq  For every soldier whose mission is to engage in active combat operations against an opponent there are five or more soldiers and civilians whose job is to get that soldier marine airmen sailor etcinto the combat zone and keep that soldier supplied and cared for  Wars are expensiveIn more ways than one Combat operations consume vast amounts of resources Money lives food fuel raw materials and so on See  The devil is in the details Effective organization and planning is very very important Without it you dont have a chance A soldiers life is not a glamorous one Mr Forsyth does an excellent job of showing what goes into organizing a professional and effective military force and combat operationIts a tedious and time consuming job He shows that a one hour combat operation involving a few dozen soldiers entails several thousand hours of planning and training The details that many have found to be tedious are part of war How much the details of the International Arms Trade has changed over the past forty years I cant say Obviously technology has changed However one thing that hasnt changed is the side that has the best chance of winning is the side that is the best equipped organized and led  The Dogs of War isnt a Tom Clancy novel Its a nonsentimental look at a military operation Albeit a mercenary operation It might be a little dry but then so is real life    Its been a lot of years since I last saw any part of the movie  more since I read it but it aged very well As usual Forsyth takes us through a long convoluted setup that is fascinating very much the same structure as The Day of the Jackal The epilogue explains a lot but well I cant say without a huge spoiler Motivations that dont make sense will trust meWhile most of my shelf choices are obvious I put it on the mysterythriller shelf because it has a lot of that in it Who is doing what  why is often a question Plus theres a scene that would have made Luca Bragi of The Godfather proudThe setup of the novel is wonderful Theres nothing magical or easy about planning or staging this operation  the descriptions of the operations people  scenery read as if they were real Its practically a text book for staging a revolution just as The Day of the Jackal was for assassinations This last sentence was mine but the Wikipedia articles for the book has almost the exact same sentence at the bottom Great minds think alikeI really liked the  movie starring Christopher Walken  Tom Berenger httpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsbut it isnt nearly as good as the novel because there were a few critical changes that sucked a lot of the juice out of it If youre familiar with both spoilers abound for both Id recommend reading the Wikipedia entries Heres the one for the bookhttpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsCompare the story to the one above for the movie Huge difference that even Christopher Walken couldnt make up CAT Shannon is SO much more interesting than Jamie ShannonVery well read although I didnt like the English voice at first Davidsons voice  inflections really fit the story though stars  highly recommended   Oh man After almost  years of reading and enjoying Forsyths globetrotting espionagemystery thrillers I knew I was bound to come across a clunker and this ones it In a way this book is similar to his deservedly acclaimed Day of the Jackal in that in concerns the plot and execution of a serious crime for political gain While Jackal is about the assassination of French President Charles De Gaulle Dogs of War concerns the attempted coup detat of a small fictional African country in order for a British mining company to take advantage of the countrys seemingly endless supply of platinum In order to do this the company hires mercenaries to invade the country and depose its dictator Sounds like a great yarn right WRONG Great idea for a story horrible execution First of all Forsyth seems to have come across the problem that makes Tom Clancys books so insufferable endless monotonous details about a the planning and execution of an operation We get it Freddie you did your research Now how about some interesting characters and dialogue How about some suspense maybeWhile Day of the Jackal went into great detail about certain aspects of planning for the operation it was on a much smaller scale and therefore much easier to take in Here its torture Also Jackal told its story from the point of view of both the assassin and the police chasing him Its a fantastic catandmouse thriller Here theres nobody to root for Its incredibly dull The book does have its rare moments and I particularly enjoyed the twist ending But other than thatmehForsyth wrote great novels before this one Day of the Jackal The Odessa File He also wrote many great novels since The Negotiator The Deceiver The Fourth Protocol Icon among others Also his short story collection No Comebacks is definitely worth checking out But he seemed to be sleepwalking through this one    In keeping with my usual practice for books Ive only read in a Readers Digest condensed version Im not presuming to review or rate this one However I do want to post an interesting background factoid Zangara the fictional African nation that serves as the setting here was directly modeled on the reallife country of Equatorial Guinea which Forsyth visited just before writing the book and psychotic President Kimba is a fictionalized version of EGs first president Macias Nguema whose dictatorial reign of terror  was ended by his overthrow and execution The country is still a hotbed of tyranny paranoia and corruption and The Dogs of War is still a banned book there    A classically Forsyth book The Dogs of War or How to take over a small WestAfrican country with a gang of wellarmed friends  is ninetenths description to the reader of the meticulous planning that goes into pulling off something big and impressive The plotting is extremely sophisticated and tension is kept high as our notparticularlysympathetic protagonist Cat Shannon is fixed to a tight schedule by ruthless employers The final tenth of the book is needless to say some frenetic chaotic violence which in the nature of violence never goes entirely according to planSo I liked the plotting I loved the sheer level of realism on display throughout the novel Which is hardly surprising since it turned out Freddy was indeed helping to plan a coup in Equatorial Guinea when he was researching the novel httpenwikipediaorgwikiTheDogsThe characters themselves dont really develop over the course of the novel  character development having been eschewed for greater focus on plot  but I still found the interactions between them extremely rich and entertaining The rough camaraderie of Cats gang of mercenaries the greasy greedy manipulativeness of Manson and Endean virtually any of the interviews with the numerous arms dealersIn such a novel there are of course points where for you the pacing will slow a little And the huge significance attached to the acquirement of some ammunition can leave one a little impatient when youre used to novels where ammunition is a given and people just fire the damn guns already However perseverance required does pay out and the book has a very strong ending Its also enjoyable to look back and reflect on the sheer volume of highly useful information about organising massive violence that youve taken away from this book Almost unsettling really Almost   "},

familys apartment thinking that she will be back within a few hoursParis May  On Vel dHivs th anniversary journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in Frances past Through her contemporary investigation she stumbles onto a trail of longhidden family secrets that connect her toSarah Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girls ordeal from that terrible term in the Vel dHiv to the camps and beyond As she probes into Sarahs past she begins toquestion her own place in France and to reevaluate her marriage and her life It should never be forgottenBy Sol TetelbaumReview Sarahs Key by Tatiana de Rosnay Almost a hundred readers published their reviews on Tatiana de Rosnays novel Sarahs Key Most of them rated the book in four or five stars but some of them calling the novel mediocre showed a lower rating  three stars It is necessary to admit that their opinions werent unfounded and most critical comments were fair However from my standpoint despite the fair critical comments I dont think it is necessary to list them the novel deserves a rather high rating and I will try to explain why The book is devoted to the Holocaust The author describes two stories One story is about the tragedy of a Jewish girl named Sarah The story is based on historical fact In  on the orders of German military authorities French police brutally arrested all Jewish families in Paris Almost all of them perished in concentration camps The second parallel story is about an American journalist Julia Jermond who writing an article about Vel dHivs roundup found out many horrible details of this crime committed by French police France wanted to forget about its antihuman past and thoroughly concealed it The author reminds us of those tragic facts I am not going to retell the stories They are already well known but the book gave birth to some of my thoughts In her novel the author writes with anxiety and great concern that people want to forget about the Holocaust One character of the book says Bringing back the past is never a good idea especially whatever happened during the war No one wants to be reminded of that nobody wants to think about that The book demonstrates that such amnesia can be deadly For a long time nave people believed that the world moves in the direction of higher level of humanization In their naivety they missed the point when one of the most horrible and bloodthirsty variety of anthropoids resembling humans became active Russian anthropoids captured power in the Soviet Russia invented concentration camps and killing over a million innocent people yearly Over a period of  years they killed at least  million maybe more Then World War II broke out and the world forgot about the  million innocent victims  Humanlike anthropoids appeared in other countries and people continued to believe that they were ordinary criminals Peoples beliefs melted like a piece of paper in acid when the terrifying truth about fascist factories of deaths became known People couldnt believe what they learned Using modern technology fascist anthropoids made the killing of humans a branch of industry For human beings the Holocaust is impossible to understand it is just unexplainable And the only way to prevent it from happening again is to never forget it The reviewed book is multidimensional emotionally written but unfortunately as it has been mentioned in some reviews it has weak points as well Nevertheless I was impressed with the book its main message makes the readers think and this is a sign of good literature The advantage of the book is in the strong civic position of the author that I think has made the book a bestseller  This book is about events which were not wideknown it reminds people about the necessity to be alert Otherwise the modern anthropoids will commit a new Holocaust and now all people can become their victims They already are trying to convince us that there is nothing to remember there wasnt a Holocaust at all  In general the book is well written and authors voice is strong In my opinion the book deserves not less than four stars  Everybody who cares about human life who reads books not just for entertainment will read this book with interest and will continue to return to it in hisher mind Sol Tetelbaum    I was intrigued by the plot for this book A young girl locks her brother in a cupboard at their apartment in Paris before the Police at the behest of the Nazis take away her and her family They wait for several days in a detention center in conditions like the Superdome before being sent to camps in Southern France and we wonder if she will retrieve her little brother before he dies or starves or hopefully is rescued Unfortunately another storyline involving a two dimensional American woman whining about her insensetive French husband comes in every other chapter and the mediocre writing makes what could have been an interesting story less than satisfying    October  rereading this book again for another book club I hope I like it better than the st time but so far Im not seeing it Why would she use a word like ingurgitating when you can say ate That kind of writing irritates me a lot The true story is heartbreaking and very interesting but her writing just doesnt impress me as expressing the true horrors experienced by the deported Jews or any real feeling for Julias anger at her husband disdainful treatment of her Spring  Predictable story pedestrian  predictable writing None of the plot surprises were surprising I felt I wasted my time on this book selected for a book club I belong to   spoilers Lots of spoilers Dont read thisdisclaimer This is a review of the book Sarahs Key and not the Holocaust I give the Holocaust negative infinity stars if you were wonderingFuck you Sarahs Key you manipulative sonofabitching asshole How dare you make me feel like this at Christmas Dead baby brother in a cupboard Really Gassing the parents at Auschwitz wasnt enough I dont give a goddamn what you throw at me for the rest of the story I WILL NOT CRY AFTER THAT BULLSHIT I know thats all you want and youre not going to get it Not from meNone of the miserable crap in this story would even happen Heres Sarah and her little brother as the police are banging on the door and taking the whole family away for being JewishShe grabbed him but he wriggled out of her grasp and slithered into the long deep cupboard hidden in the surface of the wall of their bedroom The one they played hideandseek in They hid there all the time locked themselves in and it was like their own little house Maman and Papa knew about it but they always pretended they didntDo they make cupboards that lock from the inside No If youve got two kids who like to play in a cupboard with a lock do you let them play in it with the key so they can lock each other in No You unlock it and hide the key Duh If the police come for you and you want to protect your brother even if you think youre coming back in the morning do you lock your brother in there for the night No No one would do that Not even a yearold Youd just close him in If the police try to open a cupboard to look inside and its locked theyre going to make you unlock it In times of extreme fear does a yearold kid decide to stay in a cupboard instead of going with their parents No   Then on top of all that were supposed to believe that a new family moves into the apartment right after the old family leaves and no one smells the rotting child in the cupboard Have you ever had a mouse die under your refrigerator A raccoon die under your porch Right But lets just assume that the family doesnt smell it Maybe they dont have noses They would still probably pick the lock so they could USE THE CUPBOARD in their goddamn new apartment The whole premise of the whole plot is just one flaw after another And then that terrible poem at the end WHYNot to mention the halfassed chicklit nitwit character I couldnt care less about Fucking Julia I wish she would die in a locked cupboard She takes up most of the book with her idiotic pregnancy and her arrogant French husband How refreshing An arrogant Frenchman Where on earth did the author come up with thatOk Ok Obviously this book made me really really mad and I gave it two stars which is kind of weird But heres why The Sarah part of the story was really quite good I learned about the Vel dHiv Roundup which is interesting and upsetting and Id never even heard of It made me feel awful and guilty and pissed off but it made me FEEL And thats somethingI shed one small tear at the very end totally against my will DAMMIT When she named the baby Sarah even though I saw it coming a mile away and I hated her anyway so why do I care URRGH I hated Julia not the baby Im sure the baby was sweet   I finished Sarahs Key this morning and I have so many thoughts going through my head about it I loved the pacing of the story how it switched between Sarahs story and Julias story up until the point where the two merged I loved how the style of Sarahs story was completely different than the style of Julias story I loved how both stories made me cry even though I knew what was coming I loved how realistically the characters were portrayed Nobody was all good or all bad just human with human frailties I loved the depictions of the small acts of conscience and kindness I had no idea about the roundups of Jews in France I did know that the Nazis tended to just send children who were too young to work straight to the gas chambers I think the author did a good job of illustrating why the French people seemed to forget what had happened and how the Holocaust indirectly affected them I hope writers continue writing stories like Sarahs Key that bring the atrocities of the Holocaust to light so we can learn and not repeat those mistakes   "},

"author": "Rudolf Hss",
"text": "SS Kommandant Rudolph Hss  was historys greatest mass murderer personally supervising the extermination of approximately two million people mostly Jews at the death camp in Auschwitz Poland Did I give this book five stars because I agree with what he did With the persecution of Jews homosexuals gypsies etc With the slaughter of millions of lives Of course not The book deserves five stars because it gets you into the mind of a cruel man who can carry out cruel actions and still be able to play the martyr In this book you will heard countless times how it wasnt Hoesss fault How he was always striving for the best he could get his prisoners How hard he was done by He even goes as far as to suggest that the work his prisoners had to do day in and day out was good for them it kept them psychologically sane At times it even felt like he was trying to vilify the prisoners in the sonderkommandoThis book was truly horrific in content and at times I simply couldnt believe what I was reading Was I supposed to just accept that the extermination of millions of people was just your typical job Hoess in clever in the way he builds up his story so that it flows into a logical way of thinking But his little tricks wont work on any selfthinking human being He can say as many times as he likes that being the commandant meant that he wasnt directly responsible for the disgusting conditions of prison life or the gassing of prisoners He can blame Himmler all he likes for making the orders nothing but orders He is not apologetic for what he did and the only thing he does regret is getting caught I recommend this book for anyone interested in WW in the running of a concentration camp or for those who want to understand what goes through the mind of evil Hoess is a definite liar with his thoughts and feelings but at least he was honest with fact    Because you cant give a Nazi  starsRudolph Hosss memoirs are perhaps the most important document attesting to the Holocaust because they are the only candid detailed and essentially honest description of the plan of mass annihilation from a highranking SS officer intimately involved in the carrying out of Hitlers and Himmlers plan from the books preface I think that is a pretty accurate depiction of what this book is Hoss was forthright in conveying his own personal history his role in the Nazi machine and his position as Kommandant of Auschwitz His formative years during WWI his  years in prison and his early years in the SS all led up to the position he would be most notorious for I learned a lot about SS hierarchy especially in regards to concentration camp administration The prewar and prefinal solution camps were mainly for political prisoners ENEMIES OF THE STATE They eventually evolved to become death factories as Hoss reflected who could imagine the horrible tasks that would be assigned to the concentration camps during the war When he was finally given the assignment to establish and build Auschwitz he adamantly vented his frustration toward his subordinates A person can fight active opposition but is powerless against passive resistance He was definitely an ifyouwantsomethingdonerightyouhavetodoityourself kind of guy The worst possible fate for a Jew at Auschwitz would be Sonderkommando herding fellow Jews into gas chambers removing the bodies liberating them of their gold teeth and hair and feeding the corpses into the furnaces It often happened that Jews from the Sonderkommando discovered close relatives among the bodies dug up after being in mass graves and even among those who went into the gas chambers Good Lord Hoss seemed remorseful when recalling the atrocities he witnessed though he admitted he had to maintain a fiercely indifferent faade and portray himself as unaffected He was responsible for developing Zyklon B which would be the vehicle that allowed the Nazis to fulfill the Final Solution at such a rapid pace And he stood by as millions were led into the gas chambers His excuse follows the typical Nazi adage that they were just following orders Hoss was a man who needed something to believe in and more importantly someone to tell him what to do from epilogueHis own account and especially his final letters to his family almost make him sympathetic ALMOST No doubt he was monstrous but there is a sense of humanity beneath his Nazi uniform and ideology His complicacy in spilling the beans to prosecutors attests to that Hoss was one of the few who could and also would give precise information about every aspect of the mass killings In fact he answered everything asked of him No doubt this is a historically significant book It also offers supplementary material like Hosss recollections of his collegues I didnt read all of them only major recognizable players like Himmler and Wannassee conference minutes Overall it was a chilling if necessary glimpse at life inside the Nazi regime and concentration camps   Commandant of Auschwitz is a true account from the Auschwitz Commandants perception of all the events taking place in Auschwitz and other concentration campsIve had this book which consists of only  pages on my bookshelf for a while now It should theoretically be a quick easy read But it isnt My stomach was churning with every page The accounts of what happened sickened me I applaud Hoess for his honest recollection while in prison waiting to be murdered for the events in Auschwitz Not one group in the camp goes unexamined by Hoess including Jehovahs Witnesses Jews women and homosexualsA particularly disturbing excerpt from the book reads By will of the Reichsfuhrer SS Auschwitz became the greatest human extermination center of all time When in the summer of  he himself gave me the order to prepare installations at Auschwitz where mass exterminations could take place and personally to carry out these exterminations I did not have the slightest idea of their scale or consequesnces It was certainly an extraordinary and monstrous order Nevertheless the reasons behind the extermination program seemed to me right I did not reflect on it at the time I had been given an order and I had to carry it out Whether this mass extermination of the Jews was necessary or not was something on which I could not allow myself to form an opinion for I lacked the necessary breadth of viewHoess continues to describe in great detail the look function and activity taking place in gas chambers He estimates numbers killed which never made it to the millions because Hoess believed there was no way there had been millions murderedThis novel is an incredible firstperson account of Auschwitz I recommend it to anyone interested in the events of World War II in Germany   This book is as Primo Levi says in the introduction filled with lies and shirks but never the less it is an extremely important document of The Final Solution the extermination machine Auschwitz Birkenau the bureaucracy the corruption and the insanity that existed in the top ranks and among the SS in AuschwitzWhile Hss details his life from growing up until the end he intersperses the story with very important details on how Auschwitz grew how the subcamps worked he also writes about his family mass exterminations daytoday activities hardships etcRemember Hss joined the nazi party and the SS voluntarily And he is considered by many to be the most cruel commandant of AuschwitzAll in all as Levi writes Hss prejudice and idiocies stick out like flies in milk but viewed with a critical eye this is a must read for anybody who wants more insight into the horrors of The Final Solution   I read this book quicklyI wanted to read it but not to linger on it any more than necessary because I felt such disgust and dirtiness just touching the pages But I think its still imporant to understand the perpetrator mentalityand try to understand what makes people do thingsThe question of the book Is Hoss completely delusional and fanatical and believing everything he says Or is he diabolical evil clever and trying to write a persuasive account so that his life or at least his reputation be savedI have to say its the latter He writes articulately and with intelligence yet contradicts himself constantly and tries to paint himself as Poor me I had to carry out orders that made me sad He claims to not be racist yet spouts off ridiculous assumptions and insults He claims he had no other choice yet he signed up and easily extricates himself when he wants to These are clearly the purposeful and deceitful writings of someone with no remorseStill despite all the revulsion that comes with reading this bnook it is worth the read If only because we cannot be educated enough on the potential horror and evil that can burst forth in our world and come out of seemingly normal peopleDepressing and terrible yes But an educational psychological study of cowardice brutality denial and weakness That as well    "},

the fate of the world GrippingI read this when it first came out in  It was an excellent read then and has lost nothing Many of us have read the historical accounts of the massive Soviet

to drag on taking with it tens of thousands other lives Only one way to find out Get a copy and start the journey to victory or utter defeat   Ive been trying to branch out in my reading lately and every time I do I get reminded why I dontThe reason I like science fiction and fantasy is that it tends to obey Eleanor Roosevelts dictum  Great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people  and chooses to discuss ideas above all else War of the Rats ought to at least succeed at the level of discussing an important event and fascinating people but it doesnt even manage to do that well Indeed War of the Rats was surprisingly bad at pretty much every level As military fiction I learned nothing about the character or nature of war None of the things that this novel is praised for felt in evidence anywhere in the text As historical fiction I didnt come away feeling like I had some understanding of the Siege of Stalingrad or gained any insight into the real figures that fought there As fiction the characters felt flat almost stereotypes suitable for a comic book perhaps but nothing else The female characters were unsurprisingly the worst and Tanias depiction was annoying at best and misogynist at worst and I say that as a staunch antifeminist As a thriller the drama never felt intense or exciting and the finale was an anticlimatic affair which failed to stand up to even its internal logic The villain character went full Cobra Commander in the end doing stupid things that made no sense at all even from the characters own reasoning as presented to the reader and which were completely at odds with the superhuman ber sniper presented earlier in the text or even with the characters own description of his plan of action For example if Thorvald knew that Zaitsev was accurate to  yards and he was he bragged accurate out to  yards why did he choose to engage Zaitsev from a static position at a distance of just  yards which he scorned as amateur earlier in the book and at which he also knew hed have no advantage over his enemy Why did he choose to shoot the fake position first when hed already determined where Zaitsev really was Shouldnt you shoot the real position first then shoot the fake second to be sure rather than the other way around Why having realized hed been given away did he not simply duck down and retreat to a better position  preferably one km back as hed set out to do in the first place The whole thing was just a mess that felt a waste of my time Maybe it wouldnt have been so bad but between Japanese Destroyer Captain Victory into Defeat The Goblin Emperor and A Face Like Glass Id been on a real roll lately and this just felt wholly unworthy I keep trying to branch out from what I know but every time I do I just feel burned Either the writer cant write Or the writer cant tell a story Or the writer simply has nothing interesting to say If at least two of the three were true I still might still be able to recommend the work but in this case I can only say that Robbins offers up a readable work that fails for me to be even good potato chip fiction   Finally I have read a novel by my former creative writing professor I can stop feeling guilty nowWasnt sure if I would enjoy it because it is a war novel but it is actually a love story masquerading as a war novel  kind of Also it was about tactics survival humanity good and evil and some very good charactersYet at the same time by the end I found myself a little perplexed regarding what it was about  it both began long before and ended after the supposed central conflict of the novel a snipers duel This offcenter presentation was very appropriate since war shouldnt be reduced to a simple high concept narrative but it was rather noticeable by the endMost of the problem is that two characters are given highly unsatisfactory endings which was not the authors intent  the editor decided to take out the last four chapters for mysterious editorial reasons they are available on the authors website When I get around to reading them I suspect Ill feel more satisfiedAlso I felt like Zaitsev one of the main characters didnt become really complex until about halfway through  wouldve been nice to get to know him earlierGenerally a beautifully written high tension characterdriven story by one of the nicest smartest people I know   If you ever seen the movie Enemy at the Gates this books premise is going to sound familiar to you Of course there is a logical explanation for that as it is based on a true storyor it could have just been Soviet propaganda but its based on somethingThere are four main characters two Russians and two Germans The Russian snipers are certainly real Vasily Zaytsev became famous during World War  in the Battle of Stalingrad the bloodiest battle of the war He was so successful as a sniper that he eventually started his own sniper school Tania Chernova was one of his students and lover The two Germans not so real One is a corporal named Nikki Mond who I think is pure fiction the other Heinz Thorvald is mentioned in Zaytsevs diaries as a main sniper in the German army that he had a duel with There is no other record of him existingAll the characters are interesting if a little bland I did find Tanias chapters a little annoying as she came off as a know it all and always sticking her nose into everything What I did like was that the book also was about the harsh conditions the soldiers went through at that battle both Russian and German alike It gets bleak for the Germans at the end which is expected considering the entered with  men and came back with only  Its a good read with some interesting things about the battle   War of the Rats by David L Robbins completely captivated me throughout the entire story This fictional book was based around Vasily Zaitsev the reallife Russian supersniper in World War II and his battle against The Schoolmaster who was sent to eliminate him The book is set in Stalingrad and is told from the perspectives of Zaitsev his female sniper trainee Tania his German enemy The Schoolmaster and a German soldier named Nikki Zaitsev is a Russian sniper from Siberia who is causing massive destruction to the German troops in Stalingrad He not only takes out machine gunners and officers but he sets fear in the German forces The Russian reporters are using him as propaganda to inspire the Russian troops and homestead as well as to instill fear in the Germans The newspapers brag about his ability and the ability of his trainees the Hares to shoot deep into German lines catching any officer or solider who shows his head to take a smoke or scratch his ear Zaitsev made the Germans feel as if they were never safe no matter how far behind their own lines they were German leaders realized this and hired the best sniper they had from Berlin to hunt Zaitsev down The book captures your attention through nailbiters and constant action on the duel of the best snipers in Stalingrad This book opened my eyes to the very effective uses of propaganda in war Newspapers and reporters transformed a solider from Siberia into a hero for the Russian troops The vast importance of shooting down this figurehead forced the German officials to fly in their own supersniper for a duel to the death Even though the duel would ultimately result in the loss of few lives compared to the huge battles and advancements from both sides around them the loss of either of their lives would be extremely important If Zaitsev had lost the German army could reestablish morale and keep their troops motivated while crushing the invincible feeling that kept the Russian resistance to the invasion of Stalingrad alive When The Schoolmaster was eventually killed by Zaitsev the message was sent that the best of the Russians was better than the best of the Germans When Nikki The Schoolmasters guide and assistant saw his supersniper defeated his whole aspect changed He noticed the lies in the encouraging radio messages from Berlin about the successes of the German forces especially when the radio station put on carols apparently sung by German soldiers of the Sixth Army The army was encircled by a blizzard and by Russian forces and were certainly not broadcasting Throughout the book you can see the loss of morale of the soldiers This book puts the importance of motivation of morale on full display When one thinks of the keys of success to a military one does not generally think of morale and motivation as the top choices But this book showed how that was a turning point for the success of the Russians in defending Stalingrad Zaitsev and Tania throughout the story used the defense of their homeland as their motivation However the only motivation from the perspective of the German solider Nikki was to return home He had to connection to Hitlers Cause and only joined the soldiers in invading Stalingrad because he wanted to go home as fast as he could Only the wealthy and sheltered German Sniper who was at home teaching and attending operas until called upon to kill Zaitsev completely believed in and understood Hitlers cause but even he fought just to go home When Nikki and The School Master are tracking Zaitsev they come across a German trench where the men are driven insane for fear of the snipers The Hares were baiting them out with rattling cans and blasting their heads off as they took a look The men feared for every second because if they looked they died but if they didnt Russian soldiers could sneak up on them like pigs in a pen I was unsettled by the view of lives as very fragile and very breakable but as unimportant individually Nikki hardly batts an eye when he loses two of his commanders and his supersniper as his ticket home He moves on as though he is a robot and it is scary that the soldiers build up such a hard shell to death In the end of the book the Sixth Army is encircled in terrible weather by the Russian troops They are hopeless and cannot fight any longer Many of them result to cannibalism or suicide The captain of the Sixth Army Captain Paulus is ready to surrender but Hitler in Germany forces him to reject the treaty and continue fighting He promoted Paulus to field marshal knowing that none had ever surrendered Hitler wanted the captain to commit suicide so that the army could go down with German Pride This disgusted me that entire armies of starving desperate men were moved like pawns on a chessboard in order to let others retreat further Instead of allowing surrender they were forced to continue fighting even though they were doomed so that they looked good to the public Hitler wanted to make sure the army looked good at home so mothers would continue sending their sons to war Meanwhile radio broadcasts from Berlin still told of the Definite victory that the Germans would have in Stalingrad This perspective of war intrigued me and stuck in my mind This book was also intriguing because of the mind sets of the soldiers on the view of death It was shocking to me how quickly a character was snubbed out and how short the reactions were from their friends War hardened these soldiers and the author did an excellent job portraying this especially in the character Tania Tania was a Russian sniper from America who had returned to her native Russia to get her grandparents to safety When she was too late she became hardened and shut out her family seeing them as weak for not fighting for Russia Her character develops as you see her go from reckless and not caring about anything but killing Germans to finally realizing she cannot be driven by hate as she starts to care for Zaitsev and form deep friendships with the other Hares After her reckless actions kill some of her fellow snipers her character starts to develop into one who finally cares about what she is doing and fights to defend her friends out of love for them and her country not solely for revenge and hate of the GermansI gave this book five stars because it stuck in my mind long after I finished reading it The perspective of war from the point of view of snipers was extremely interesting in the fact that they did extreme damage not only physically but shot by shot slowly killed the hope of the other army I was impressed by the way that the author showed that hopelessness was a real and terrible killer in war I was unsettled by the view of the loss of lives as sad but unimportant if they were not figureheads that could be showed off to the public as heroes I learned the effectiveness of figureheads and propaganda and how dangerous they could be and that fighting in defense of your homeland can make you stronger than those who fight with no real cause The unique female participation in the Russian army also interested me as I didnt know women fought as snipers and soldiers as well as radio broadcasters and communicators I thought that the author did an excellent job in character development as well as keeping the reader engaged throughout the book I recommend this book for anyone who loves action and war strategy and for someone who hopes to understand the life of a soldier or sniper in Stalingrad Overall this book was an unsettling but educating and important read worthy of five stars    "},

unique characters he leaves us with a mature brilliant and memorable vision of humanity in the face of inhumanity itselfFrom the Hardcover edition LIBERATION ROAD is billed as a novel of World War II but its really a story of two men Rabbi Ben Kahn is a Chaplain with the American Army in France  his personal crusade is to find out what happened to his son  a missing fighter pilot Joe Amos is a

struggle with their own personal demons an American man makes his fortune in the Black Market in Paris Is this mysterious Chien Blanc Bens missing sonThe concentration of LIBERATION ROAD is on Joe and Bens individual wars Theres a very intimate personal feeling to their stories which makes this the sort of book that the characters are absolutely central to Theres little by way of coverage of the full horror of the Second World War to the local people or any acknowledgment of the rest of the Allies fighting There are some small cameos by two local French people in Joes story  a romantic attachment in particular which could be seen as poignant on the face of it but as it ends theres little opportunity to understand what war has done to those locals trying to simply survive in such

home to his family how their individual experience will affect both men for the rest of their lives    The shocking opening occurs  days after the allied invasion of Normandy then the book backtracks to DDay and follows the cast of characters as they slog through France Unlike most war novels which focus solely on the trigger pullers the three main characters in this book are a rabbi a truck

Gostei mesmo muito  Guerra Mundial e baseado em factos reais passada no Egipto  o suficiente para mimE no lhe dei  porque no sei se algumas das coisas que achei mais fracas se devem ao autor ou apenas  traduo e adaptao que quanto a mim deixaram algo a desejar no me pareceram especialmente boas Como no li o original dou o benefcio da dvida ao autorMas  um livro muito bom para quem gosta do gnero Uma histria bem contada embora no possamos esquecer que o autor  jornalista sobre os bastidores da guerra em que o sentido do dever da amizade e do amor se misturam e que tornam difceis e dolorosas algumas decises Com um fim algo imprevistoGostei   This novel has been described as A heartwrenching tale of friendship love and treachery set against the exotic and intriguing backdrop of wartime Egypt and that sums up my own experience perfectly The Cairo Code will linger in your thoughts long after you close the pages Nevertheless I have argued with myself over how to rate the novel The plot gets five stars no question about it but I was not convinced the execution was of the same calibre in the early stages of the novel As a Christian reader there were also some aspects of the story that made me a little uncomfortable Based on the books publisher I selected this book for review under the incorrect assumption that it was a Christian novel But when all is said and done this novel got under my skin in a way that made anything less than five stars seem dishonestIn  Jack Johann Halder Harry Weaver and Rachel Stern took part in an archaeological dig that forged a strong friendship Four years later they find themselves caught up on opposite sides of WWII unknowingly pitted against each other in an assignment that none of them can afford to fail We know that neither Roosevelt nor Churchill were assassinated so to a certain extent we know what the outcome must be and yet the further I got into the novel the more urgently I needed to discover just how all the chips would fallAs compelling as the action was it was the emotional tension that had me propping up my eyelids with matchsticks in order to finish the book I guess thats females for you If I had to choose one word to sum up this story I would say poignant but I dont think that does justice to the depth or array of emotions I had experienced by the end I mean what do you do when your best friend and the woman you love and thought had died turn out to be involved in a plot to assassinate the President of the United States One things for sure There are no easy answersIt did take a little while for this story to get to the action so much so that I began to wonder whether the categorisation of thriller was really warranted This was largely because the author took the time to introduce several of the major players in the story not just Jack Harry and Rachel which in turn meant following several seemingly disconnected characters at first But it was time well spent because the friction between these characters and their differing agendas and personalities was a large part of what drove the action forward Once the assignment got underway any doubts about the label thriller were left in the dustMy main reservation stems from being a Christian reader and reviewer Having assumed this was a Christian novel I was initially surprised to find some rather frank acknowledgements of sexual attraction as well as several references to sexual activity outside of marriage including at clubs and brothels That being said there were no descriptive bedroom scenes and most direct references were limited to a few sentences within a larger scene The word bloody also appeared frequently as a mild expletive but this was the worst expletive used in the novel While I did not necessarily enjoy these aspects I did feel that they were true to the characters and the plot and I only mention them as a courtesy to other likeminded readers who may make the same assumption I did based on the publisherThis book was an affecting portrayal of friendship loyalty and the truth that there are no winners in war Thank you to Howard Books for providing a copy of this book in return for my honest review   Disclosure Reason for the  star rating Sentiment was responsible My dad served in the US army Corps of engineers near Cairo as support for theBritish effort against Rommel before operation Torch was launched Ive seenphotos of the sandbagged Sphinx the camels the vehicles and the general areaduring the war In addition I have fairly intensively studied the history ofmigration and naval warfare in the eastern Mediterranean which included Africaand descriptions of the archaeology over large parts of the kingdoms there Forthose reasons I had an unexpected background interest in the bookI thought that the author of this book did a very good job of portraying thearea the warfare the mechanical equipment and the social pressures of theearly s However an impartial evaluator should classify this book as aromance novel written for men as I suspect that the majority of readers whofinish the book will be menThe story of  kids who grew up together in the US one the son of a working manwho worked for the wealthy father of the other kid would be acceptable up tothe point that they were both on the same archaeological project in an exoticlocation and fell for the same girl just before the war and just as they werecoming out of their teenage years However for both of them to become militaryintelligence officers for opposing sides and be unexpectedly brought into directconflict against each other is too improbable except in fantasy fiction For thegirl to be exposed as a leading spy for the Nazis throughout the timeframe ofthe book and for both young men to be totally unaware of her status until theend of the book added an exciting and unexpected twist but also undermined thepracticality of a of an actual historical story line The fact that in themiddle of an intense manhuntevasion sequence the author kept referring to theidea that both guys were in love with the girl whom neither had seen for overthree years and both believed to be dead gave the impression of reading aboutpining teenagersNonetheless I thought that this was an articulate and well written book It hada fast pace despite having almost too many mundane details which requiredreading through Those details did provide a rich background for a very goodaction plot The characters and actions in general were very believable andwithout the fantasy romance overtones would have moved this novel more firmlyinto the classification of historical fiction This has no super hero charactersand no action grabbing shootumups There were chase sequences on open desertroads and limited action wartime violence which resulted in killings but theseelements were in character with real small unit war time actions   I received this book from Howard Books Blogger Program for no charge in exchange for my honest review The opinions expressed here are my ownBook Description The international bestseller takes you on a fastpaced nailbiting thrill ride from the Great Pyramids in Cairo to behind the Nazi lines in Berlin to the very seat of democracy as our hero tries to unravel a plot that could kill FDR and Winston ChurchillTo save the Western Allies he must kill the woman he lovesNovember  Adolf Hitler sanctioned his most audacious mission everto kill US President Franklin D Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill while they visit Cairo for a secret conference to plan the Allied invasion of Europe an invasion which threatens imminent defeat for GermanyOnly one man is capable of leading the defiant Nazi missionMajor Johann Halder one of the Abwehrs most brilliant and daring agents He is a man with a tortured soul and a talent for the impossible Accompanied by an expert undercover team and Rachael Stern the young and beautiful Egyptologist Halder must race against time across a hostile desert to reach Cairo and successfully complete the assignment or else forfeit his life and the life of his sonWhen US military intelligence hears about the plan they assign LieutenantColonel Harry Weaver one of their best officers to hunt down and eliminate Halder and his team But for Weaver as well as for Halder and Stern theres more than the balance of war and the lives of the Allied leaders at stakea pact of love and friendship will be tested in the frantic highstakes chase to the deathBased on a real attempt to kill the President The Cairo Code is a breathless suspenseful thrillera heartwrenching tale of friendship love and treachery set against the exotic and intriguing backdrop of wartime EgyptMy Thoughts The Cairo Code is the latest release of Glenn Meade and it is FANTASTIC The Cairo Code had been previously titled The Sands of Sakkara As a huge fan of Glenn Meades books I was so excited to have the opportunity to read it This book is a Christian Historical Fiction which my readers know is one of my favorite genres Glenn Meade writes with authority about The world in the s and s military intelligence for the United States Egypt England and Germany archeology The Nazi Party the concentration camps and the attempt on the presidents life As a huge fan of Historical Fiction I have found myself drawn this part in history and I find myself learning so much every time I read one of these books I found myself drawn into this book from the start and guessing until the end how things would work out The characters in this book are awesome They are very complex characters that arent always what they seem My favorite characters would have to be Rachel Stern Major Johann Halder and Lt Colonel Harry Weaver They are very complicated characters in very interesting and hard situation in this book The three of them are a love triangle and all three of them once friends on the same side end up all on different sides of the war Their love for one another definitely puts them all in very difficult situations and the interactions are fantastic I love Glenn Meades style of writing and I really felt like I was there on this adventure with our characters The Cairo Code is a Christian Historical Thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian Historical Fiction with high action you will NOT be disappointed I look forward to reading more of Glenn Meades books I give this book  STARS    The Cairo Code is a HUGE book that weighs in at nearly double the pages of most books I review Although publicized as a thriller I was approximately halfway through it before the action seemed to pick up The author spent much of the first half laying down background information on not only the primary three characters but others who played prominent roles as well I freely admit that there were several times I was tempted to put it away but persevered because I had committed to review itOverall the story is an intriguing one To me its chief interest was the bond between Jack Halder Harry Weaver and Rachel Stern and how that affected the outcome as they were pitted against each other on opposite sides of the war and their roles in the attempt to assassinate President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill The story itself was well written and once it finally got moving it progressed at a steady pace Although we know from history that the plot was not successful there were a few surprises in store before the endI feel that I should issue a word or two of warning I accepted The Cairo Code for review because other books Ive received from Howard Books have been Christian fiction There was no mention of the Lord or Jesus in the narrative More than one character engaged in intimate relationships outside of marriage Scenes were not explicit but were nevertheless not really necessary to the plot In addition those who do not like violence might want to steer away from this book also Again the violence was not particularly gory and would be expected in a novel about war The third warning is that apparently this novel was originally published as The Sands of Sakkara Readers who had already read this book might be disappointed to buy the same book with a different titleA copy of this book was provided for review by Howard Books a division of Simon  Schuster Inc   "},

"text": "Hailed as one of the finest novels to come out of the Second World War The Naked and the Dead received unprecedented critical acclaim upon its publication and has since become part of the American canon This fiftieth anniversary edition features a new introduction created especially for the occasion by Norman MailerWritten in gritty journalistic detail the story follows an army platoon of foot soldiers who are fighting for the possession of the Japaneseheld island of Anopopei Composed in  The Naked and the Dead is representative of the best in twentiethcentury American writing Us readers have no homes like unnoticed birds we perch anywhere like the most disturbed stalkers we go through anybodys underwear drawer like vicious taxgatherers we audit everyone the writers especially their creatures the characters very particularly and hanging between all three of us the book It sits there in its cover We ticket we note we award with our eyes brains and stars We scribble in the margins to the outrage of future readers  well I do maybe you do not do that I never mind if someone has previously done thatSo I have looked out of Humbert Humberts paedophiliac eyes I overheard the good man Jesus and the scoundrel Christ I declined and fell with Paul Pennyfeather and I closely observed Molly Bloom in her bed for at least three hours she didnt notice a thing It was like I wasnt there With Jeanette Winterson I too grew up in a crazy Christian cult and like others before me I could not stop Merricat Blackwood from her pyromania whatever I did Well you could all say similar things Our acceptance of the thousand varieties of human beingness is almost limitless We are promiscuity itself The Naked and the Dead is not really about World War Two or about war in general its about looking through the eyes of men a whole bunch of them sleeping with them eating with them drinking pissing and fighting with them In this novel the thing to have is a penis The testosterone floweth through this novel as doth the Ganges through India And I just couldnt do it I didnt want to go through all this painful stuff with a bunch of assorted blokes constantly eating farting sleeping waking yakking being blown up or not writing letters bragging playing poker theorising banally about women and on And onBecause there are a thousand characters Mailer provides each with a description round the time they are introduced Such asHe was a little over medium height well fleshed with a rather handsome suntanned face and graying hair His expression when he smiled was very close to the ruddy complacent and hard appearance of any number of American senators and businessmen but the tough goodguy aura never quite remained There was a certain vacancy in his face like the vacancy of actors who play American congressmen Well after several descriptions like this everything blurs together and you realise why Catch works so well because in that war novel everyone is a cartoon no painful attempt at ultrarealistic detail at all so Milo Minderbinder Major Major Colonel Korn and the rest remain intact in the memory years later But really me trying to read ND was doomed to failure It could have been a good one I guess you never know until you try heck Ive liked some funny things in my time But the signs were not good I am ferociously biased against novels written by  year olds and any novels written by anyone under  Writing novels is like the opposite of pop music Evelyn Waugh has squeaked by Decline and Fall and I guess you have to give Mary Shelley the nod too then theres Dickens of courseok ok MOSTLY I dont think people under  can write a good novel Norman Mailer is no Mary Shelley and he would have been the first to admit thatI hate war stories  Hamburger Hill Platoon From Here to Eternity I avoid them all I did watch Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line and like thats enoughI thought I should read this because I was reading Norman Mailers biography which is VERY ENTERTAINING but I just always wanted to be finding out what happened to NORMAN next not the boys in the jungles of Anopopei I can tell this is really a heck of an accomplishment he commands his material fearlessly thers no holding back hes a right knowitall and somebody needed to do a big honest novel about men in WW which could be set beside the big thumpers from WW there wont be any great novels coming out of WW So for me this was a  star experience from a  star novel abandoned a little shamefacedly but with relief   I cant recall how many years ago I tried to read this  probably  or more I recall hearing that it was the best story about war ever written so impressionable as I was at that age I decided Id have to read it My only recollection is that very early on there was a scene of such grim death and destruction that I felt physically sickened Coward that I was and probably still am I gave up the attempt to work my way through this tome immediately I noticed an excellent review from a GR friend and it reminded me of this unfinished task that of my failure to complete the book not that of recording my failure to do so So Im now asking myself whether Im man enough to give it another go I have no answer to that question at present Maybe I will in another  years   This is a book about America Its no secret that Tolstoy is Mailers favorite author and reading this book right after reading War and Peace gave me a good perspective on everything defined in this book It captures a uniquely American milieu of characters at a time when a uniquely american sence of Idenity and patriotism was being forged It spoke of the physical and intellectual challenges of various backgrounds through about a dozen main characters with learned empathy And in the end and throughout you get to glimpse all the indelible cruelity of reality as would be expected by for forboding titleThe book is also brashly written by a novice Mailer himself will admit his syntax tends towards the simplistic which lends the book a pageturning thiller characteristic that actually aides the reading experience possibly to the chagrin or the more established lit snobs What does hurt the book is some occasionally akward diction and character development for some of the books figures The hispanic sergant for example who is a capable if not confident soldier for some reason has an inner monologue that is written in fractured and childlike stream of consciouseness as if Mailer equated difficulty speaking a English as a second language with stupidity The crudeness of the soldier banter also can occasionally ring hollow especially given liberal use of standin euphenisms for censored swear wordsIn the end the book is of extreme high quality readable illuminating passionate and empathic It is well structured and mostly well written and in a couple places exremely influencial Im tempted to give it five stars but in the end I think the book maybe wasnt as beautiful and influencial as some of my favorite five star readsParting ShotsDid anyone else think the writting of Japbait was somewhat oversimplisticWho else loved that last line of the bookSo the Leiutenent admitted he hated Thomas Manns Magic Mountain but his conversations with the General really reminded me of Catsorps relationship with Leo Naphta in Manns classic   Executioners Song was one of the best books Ive read in the past year  so good I havent felt up to reviewing it  so I had high expectations for The Naked and the Dead The frontcover blurb from the SF Chronicle speculates that this novel is perhaps the best book to come out of any war which really jacked up the ante and got me intriguedWell I got only a little over a hundred pages in and IMHO The Naked and the Dead isnt bad but it is not a better book than War and Peace or The Iliad Its not even a true classic though it is a good read The Naked and the Dead was probably a lot more essential before we had access to so many war movies you can see all the war movie cliches already present though there isnt a black guy the troops arent yet integrated and Jews and Hispanics are the minority characters here I have to say that I dont think this has aged all that well You can definitely see why it was a bestseller at the time and you can also see Mailer was in his early twenties when he wrote this his first novelIts a welltold story and interesting but its  pages long If it were  pages or if I cared more or didnt have other options Id keep going but I need to get through my postProustum depression with something that really makes my toes curl and this aint itMaybe some other time It is a fun read One of my favorite things is how all the characters say fug all the time as in fug you motherfuggerIt does feel dated which is not always a bad thing   This is an amazing book considering it was the authors first published novel All the more amazing considering Mailer was something like  years old when he wrote it I picked it up after reading somewhere that Mailer actually joined the military during WWII in order to gain some life experience so he could write a book I really enjoyed Mailers writing style It was vivid alive and gritty Mailer describes the jungle in perfect detail You can almost feel yourself being smothered by the dense foliage and overpowering humidity Add to this the atmosphere of fear and anxiety that Mailer so deftly creates and youve got a great war novel Some of the flashbacks can become a little drawn out and at times it is a little hard to keep track of whos who due to the large number of characters I love the fact that there is no hero or character who can be seen as the good guy Mailer exposes each characters hang ups and dysfunctions and simply shows how each functions under the stress of combat and military life in general I can see why this book was so controversial when it came out in the s cussing graphic violence sexuality homoeroticism etc This must have been a wake up call for a lot of people who were used to the sanitized John Wayne style stories of heroism and clear cut moral divides Good stuff   "},

"text": "The thrilling sequel to Alistair MacLeans masterpiece of World War II adventure The Guns of Navarone Now reissued in a new cover styleThe guns of Navarone have been silenced but the heroic survivors have no time to rest on their laurels Almost before the last echoes of the famous guns have died away Keith Mallory Andrea and Dusty Miller are parachuting into wartorn Yugoslavia to rescue a division of Partisans  and to fulfil a secret mission so deadly that it must be hidden from their own allies The movie was great too bad it was nothing like the book which was even better The book starts with Mallory Miller and Andrea being picked up at an airfield in Greece The movie has only Mallory and Miller being pulled out of the sea by the Royal Navy The movie adds two Americans Harrison Ford and Carl Weathers which were not in the book The movie also omits one of the most crucial characters in the book Sgt Reynolds The rivalrybickering between Miller and Reynolds in the book add so much to the plot but the movie omitted it Alistair MacLean actually wrote some of the screenplays for the movies made about his books Unfortunately this is not one of them Although there are gaping differences between the book and the movie they are both great and I would recommend either to anyone If I had to pick as usual I think between the two Id pick the book   I grew up reading Alistair MacLean and think its a shame he isnt more well known today  believe all his books are currently out of print and there are none in the Northern Virginia library system That said he hasnt aged as well as some of his contemporaries but then neither has Ian Fleming He had a few really great books  mostly his war and Cold War books HMS Ulysses Guns of Navarone Ice Station Zebra Where Eagles Dare  and a bunch of real stinkers in his later career But overall both his plotting and writing style look a little convoluted by todays standards I can still remember my Dad being totally confused by the movie version of Where Eagles Dare  wait so is Richard Burton bad now or still good and this is clearly evident in this book as well In addition his characters engage in too much clever banter he really cant write women and he exhibits an omniscient POV that flits back and forth between what all the characters are thinking and which is considered bad writing today Also as MacLeans only sequel that I know of this story doesnt stack up against his classic Guns of Navarone Its interestingly set in Bosnia and so should ring particularly relevant today But he never really gives us a feel for the setting  it could be any European forest with a bunch of generic guerillas taking on the Germans One final note as with Guns Ive always assumed but never seen any supporting story that he intentionally named his mountainclimbing New Zealand hero Mallory in honor of George Mallory the famous climber who died trying to climb Mt Everest later conquered by fellow kiwi Edmund HillarySogood MacLean but not great MacLean  and so for anyone looking to explore this largelyforgotten author Id look elsewhere including Netflix   Im a huge Harrison Ford fan so its a wonder that Ive never actually watched Force  From Navarone all the way through I picked up the book a couple years ago just getting around to reading it because Im one of those people You know the ones who read the book because of the movie and vice versa as was the case with this bookI must say that having not read or even watched Guns From Navarone didnt deter me in the least After reading Force  Im definitely going to hunt for Guns and maybe even other Allistair MacLean books I normally dont get that itch where I simply cant put a book down and so read it in a short amount of time This one however I did WhyThe story was interesting and held me captive throughout Yes there are those unbelievable moments even the author says so in his storytelling yet it still manages to feel okay It was the characters though that I enjoyed the most I see a little of myself in Miller who is sarcastic Then theres Andrea who provides some comic relief in the form of quips about his new bride From beginning to end I was intrigued by these characters and the ever unfolding plot    After a successful mission of Navarone both Mallory and Miller who were the main characters of the book  go to Island of Kheros to pick up Andrea  an another important  hulklike character of the book who was there to get married with Maria But it didnt lasted long and form there their Journey began where they flew towards the Termoli Airfield located in Italy to meet the Captain Jensen who then briefed them about the mission and sent them to the Neretva to help the Partisans lead by Gen Vulkalovic who where somewhere trapped in the so called Zenica Cage along with the three Marine Sergeants Reynolds Groves and Saunders Six of them then fly from the Termoli Base to the Neretva reveal the secret behind why the Allied agents parachuted before were getting disappeared trapped there At first six of them meet the group of Partisans led by Dorshny after which they meet the German Army Captain Neufeld who then told that those people under Dorshny arent Partisans  they were Cetniks Now here these six men are accompanied with two more persons Petar and Maria  of which Petar claimed to be blind and Maria claimed to be her sister  but their actual identities are revealed till the end Petar turns out to be the head of British Espionage in Balkans and Maria was ferocious Cetnik fighter  Along with the escorts those six cover some of the distance in asphyxiated truck and later Mallory meets the General Bronzik the place where the Saunders die Mallory Miller and Andrea were quite sure that killer was Dorshny  which at later point of time comes out to be true But Reynolds consider that Mallory is betraying them which turns out to be nothing more than absurdityNow after taking the information they go back to Neufeld and Dorshny where they capture both of them and make them move to the remote blackhouse where they find the four disappeared Army agents none of them was hurt And then lock them inside the blackhouse but as part of plan he keeps the keys for the following Sergeant Bear who was following them which released them and then they followed the Mallory and the team And again they go to the same blackhouse and again captures all of them  destroy their radio and close them inside but again making some arrangement for them so that they can follow them as it was the part of the plan General Zimmerman who was the German captain was clandestinely hidden in the woods of south of Neretva Neufeld used to tell him by the radio about the plans of Mallory which in fact Mallory wanted Neufeld to send this information as it was all planned  Later comes the action packed climax Lots of brutal killing happens All the six persons go down to the Neretva Gorge after travelling through the old locomotive and others means Dorshny and the team followed them They tried to keep the Dorshny and the team to clung to the bridge where as at the same time Mallory and the Miller climbed through the ladder to the top of dam wall where they clamped the amatol cylinders on the walls of the dam As Zimmerman was not having any idea about what is happening he kept almost all his soldiers concealed near and to the bridge in the south which later due to the was totally vanished as the dam wall was being bombarded and all the waters from above  meters high fell down at the Neretva Gorge So thats how Mallory and team finished the mission being camouflaged in the beginning playing the part of deserters which later in the book Mallory tell everybody that Neufeld and Dorshny already were aware of their true identities PersonalitiesMallory A protagonist laconic person with the best presence of mind which appears to be quite calm and serene in the starting but turns out to be the best decision maker and one of the best Mountain ClimberMiller Witty sarcastic all the time The presence of mind  if sarcasm is concerned Is the best Some of the following quotes make it quite clear the level of his sarcasmJust after the Andrea got married to Maria  and suddenly they ran in the altercation which made Maria to leave Andrea andAndrea said moodily Shes gone home to her mother Miller glanced at his watch One minute and twentyfive seconds he said admiringly  A world recordWell there are just innumerable examples of his sarcasm and wittinessAndrea  Captain Stavros Well it projects the image of Rambo A hulklike personality he bears A berserk  which is always accompanied with acrid smelling cigaretteWell  in this book  Andrea made a quote when he was totally exasperated and knowing that Capt Jensen wont allow them to rest and as they wanted rest so he said the brilliant line Luck deserts tired manReynolds Groves and Saunders die at the end which gives the emotional touch to the dambusting action packed storylineOn the other hand hats off to Alaster Mcclaens verbosity and the way to express the tableau    Liked this book perhaps a little less than Guns of Navarone That was a pretty straightforward story this is so twisted that it seems like Alistair MacLean is trying to confuse you on purpose This book was a lot more like the movie Where Eagles Dare which I shall have to look for in book form to see how that is Lots of twists and turns and secrets kept from the reader and not a few of these put in perhaps just for the sake of being a twist and not really propelling the story anyOne other commentor said the banter between the main characters got a little much in this book and I can see what they mean It was acceptable but perhaps a little on the excessive side Also I cant remember Andrea having such a compulsion to smoke in the last book  where did that come fromAnyway  a not so bad way to pass a couple of cloudy cold March afternoons   "},

"text": "An entire navy had tried to silence the guns of Navarone and failed Fullscale attacks had been driven back Now they were sending in just five men each one a specialist in dealing death A classic thriller MacLean always delivered the goods I remember devouring all of his titles out of the library I wouldnt suggest doing them in a row because things can get a little repetitive But thats to be expected of almost any authorThe concept of having a team as the only way to take out the guns guarding a narrow straight through which the ships needed to rescue troops have to traverse is a bit forced But it does lend to a tight thriller with a clock tickingWhats best about this book is the interplay among the various agents and then the locals Betrayal and doublecrosses keep the plot moving    StarsQuite by accident I picked this up and started reading From the first page the esteemed war thriller author Alistair MacLean engages his reader Off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea the Germans and Italians control a cluster of islands and the area shipping lanes On one island  British soldiers are trapped and will soon be attacked by the Axis Alliance The destruction of the mighty Guns of Navarone is the only hope these Brits have It is a suicide mission The guns are protected by both nature and man in their fortress But a savvy military strategist may have found the how and who to silence these great guns Captain Keith Mallory is legendary The New Zealander is a renowned rock climber and knows how to survive behind enemy lines His faithful friend and his good luck charm Andreas is a Greek resistance fighter has no qualms killing Germans The young Stevens is proficient in German and Greek is also a great climber but is afraid of his fear American Corporal Miller is a demolitions specialist and Brown is known for his saboteur skills They have  days to scale the sheer  foot cliffs on the southern side of Navarone destroy the guns and get out before the British fleet sails into the Aegean channel to fortify the trapped soldiers After the climb that almost killed them the team believes the hardest part of the mission is behind them But the Navarone fortress proves to be as great of a challenge as the cliffs They have to choice but to destroy those guns Many mens lives are dependent upon their success And they will die trying to accomplish the missionMacLean is a master story teller with intimate knowledge of the military He served on a cruiser in WWII while serving in the Royal Navy His writing is fast paced with a great detail that does not bough down the story line His twists are like gentle waves They dont jar the reader The twists and turns just seem part of the story as its natural progression Mallory and his team are well characterized This reader liked and cared about them Often I caught myself holding my breath as I read the book In my opinion the  movie Guns of Navarone just put faces to these wonderful characters The drama is in the book Though the film is dramatic and viewers are reminded of the tight time line Gregory Peck David Niven and Anthony Quinn have The book is deeper The drama and action is more complete due to MacLeans wonderful writing    I saw the movie on TV back in the s Quinn Peck and Niven made for an allstar cast Finally I read the novel Well sir Im happy to report that Alistair MacLean could tell the corker of a tale The Allied saboteurs come through lots of close shaves still intact At times their heroics leave you rolling your eyes a little but the fun is watching them strive to carry out their desperate mission There are betrayals The pace is snappy the suspense builds well and the characters feel fullfledged I found myself looking forward to getting back to reading the war tale which isnt my usual cup of tea Your mileage may vary of course but I just wanted some diverting entertainment which I found here in spades    Tense WWII thriller about a small group of commandos that has to sabotage the naval guns on an island fortress that is otherwise nighimpregnableI think what I liked the most about this is its not got that modern action movie quality of triumphing in a series of outnumbered gun battles which gets kind of silly after a while Its much more about stealth and subterfuge The other surprising quality for me is the prose MacLean really gets you feeling like the wind and rain are lashing you as you climb the cliff that cannot be scaled or shivering cold as snow falls outside while youre sheltering in some remote mountain caveThe Germans are not all nasty and cruel which I also appreciated Its almost too easy to make the antagonists nothing but hardcore SS scumbags There are some scumbag Germans to be found here but the meeting for the Alpinekorps lieutenant and Mallory is pretty good stuff These guys might have been friends if war didnt put them on opposite sides and this was handled well Very good stuff all aroundI felt like I was following the action pretty well until the final escape at which point either I lost my ability to comprehend things or the narrative became much more confusing as far as how all of the characters got back together and sailed away Thats probably all thats keeping this from a fivestar ratingTagged with Maryland vanity because the lone American character who happens to have to do some emergency field medical stuff declares that one would not find finer care at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore Lines like that are why the Maryland vanity shelf exists   When I was  or so one of my friends at school Michael Edworthy used to bring this book along every day as a sort of badge along with his Who and Yes albums He couldnt have been reading it otherwise hed have finished it rapidly We were all careful never to mention the book in case he went on about it like he did about the bands Intrigued I bought a copy and read the first of the many Alistair MacLean books I was to devour Set in WW this is storytelling for boys of the highest calibre Ha what a pun Ive just noticed a handpicked group of elite soldiers have to disable the heavily guarded monstrous weapons that cover a strait of water shortly to be traversed by an allied shipping convoy SimplesThe usual early MacLean trademarks are all here a mission with small chance of success fifth columnist infiltration selfsacrifice that brings tears of pride and edge of the seat tension and action See Where Eagles Dare HMS Ulysses No wonder Hollywood adapted it with Gregory Peck David Niven Anthony Quinn et al But

"text": "From the Childrens Laureate of England a stunning novel of the First World War a boy who is on its front lines and a childhood rememberedTheyve gone now and Im alone at last I have the whole night ahead of me and I wont waste a single moment of it    I want tonight to be long as long as my life    For young Private Peaceful looking back over his childhood while he is on night watch in the battlefields of the First World War his memories are full of family life deep in the countryside his mother Charlie Big Joe and Molly  the love of his life Too young to be enlisted Thomas has followed his brother to war and now every moment he spends thinking about his life means another moment closer to danger The sadest book I have ever readI would reccommend this to you all who like to cry over a book but I warn you to have a tissue when your near the end because youll cry your heart outThis book is passionate and brings you deep letting you know how the characthers feeling and wishing it could change to a happy ending but it also tells you what war and true love and brotherly friendship is aboutIt tells you how Charlie and Tommo Peaceful come to at the end and I wish I have never read this book because my heart aches over it but I am also glad   Words cant even describe how much this book means to meI would recommend it to anyone especially to other history nerds like me As it is the type of book that lives on even after you turn the last page No matter how many times Ive read it it never seems to lose my interest It is a very popular book used in schools but I think people of all ages can relate and feel connected in some way to this story and the characters within it not just children After reading I cant help but think about the characters and I feel sympathy for them particularly Tommo I imagine him still fighting for survival at the front still grieving Did he survive I would like to yes for his familys sake so that he can live out a final dying wish However with a war like that he has a lot to live up toA very interesting issue is raised by the Author and that is the unfairness of war This was shown particularly in Charlies unjustified death As reading it I couldnt help but feel helpless just like Tommo It just goes to show there are no good guys or bad guys in war just some very innocent people   Adapted from the book jacket Private Thomas Peaceful has lied about his age and left his family behind to follow his older brother Charlie to France to fight in the First World War Now Tommo has one almost unendurable night alone fighting sleep to reflect on his life As the minutes slowly tick by his memories are full of his childhood in the English countryside His father mother brothers and first love Molly come vividly alive in his mind But every moment Tommo spends thinking about his life means another moment closer to something he cannot bear to think about  a time when the war and its horrific consequences will change his life forever My ReactionsThis is a gutwrenching tale of brotherhood loyalty duty love courage and forgiveness I loved the close bond between the brothers both Tommo and Charlie but also their braindamaged brother Big Joe I applauded their mothers moral courage in the face of adversity I felt uncomfortable with the actions of the Colonel but recognized the British class system at work in the early th century Thank you Downton Abbey This is not the first book about World War I that I have read so I was familiar with the horrors of trench warfare and the brutal realities of a long siege but I still cringed with fear and anxiety as I read about these young men hardly older than boys and what they faced My heart about broke for Tommo and Charlie I certainly didnt see that end coming I was very glad that Morpurgo added a Postscript and Authors Note explaining some of the realities of this period in history and how the governments of Britain New Zealand Australia and the United States had such different responses to the soldiers who suffered psychological trauma on the battlefields This is the third novel Ive read by Morpurgo after    also set in WWI and    Dresden during WW My reaction to the former was lukewarm but I loved the latter    is closer to elephant than horse   Im  and we read this book in my english class Before I read this I never understood WW and WW but it opened my eyes to the suffering and sadness of it all I think the author was brilliant to not go straight to the trenches but go through Tommos whole life first I became to love Tommo alot as he grew up and Charlie too When they go to war it is just so miserable and sad and I now think all soldiers in the war and ww were complete heroes and dont get enough credit for what they did for us If you know a soldier knew one or were one thankyou so much Private Peaceful opened my eyes Infact I couldnt stop crying over war and those brave soldiers  I find it sad how Private Peaceful was a real person He had a life he wasnt just a guy who died Right before he died in world war  he probably remembered his first day of school all the loves and losses he experienced And before this book was written he would never have been remembered like the thousands of other soldiers that are now just a grave I will always remember themTommo is such a nice character he and Charlie are both so brave Because you follow them from such a young age it is hard to imagine them as young men fighting for their country This inspired me to learn more about war I went on to watch Saving Private Ryan about WW which is so sad and horrific Its strange because you only hear about it in books and watch movies about it but this actually happened to good people Some were only  They had their whole life ahead of them but they were just shot down  I dont think we should ever forget the bravery and pain So the next time you see an old man walking really slow down the street Dont underestimate him just think of what he might have went through    I first read Private Peaceful when I was about ten years old and I remember that it had a great impression on me I borrowed it from the school library without particularly high expectations I had read some of Morpurgos work before and although I had enjoyed it I recall thinking that this book looked decidely dull However when I began to read the story I found it to be both historically interesting and fantastically gripping It was the first book that really made me cry which just goes to show how effective it was emotionally It also sparked off a fascination with World War One which continues to this day as I prepare to take my History GCSE For a long time after reading the book I continued to name it as my favourite ever book Unlike many other books that have had a large effect on me I have only read Private Peaceful once because I am worried that if I reread it I will be disappointed and that my memories of this wonderful book will be tainted by an underwhelming second reading However I would definately recommend the book to anyone and I will always remember the enjoyment it provided for my ten year old self   "},

he is able to find warmth and hope But his heart aches for Albert the farmers son he left behind Will he ever see his true master again   This book is so beautiful in many ways I wanted to weep all day after I finished War Horse is very unique because its told by Joey a horse being thrusted into the war on the Western Front The story is innocent yet its so sensational and full of angst from the characters I felt attached to the story from the first chapter and couldnt peel my eyes off then Morpugo created such a striking story about the war with a horse and a boy trying to find each other I could perceive about everything through this book and lost a lot of tears by reading only  I can read this book and watch the movie without getting bored And Tom Hiddleston always slay me with his acting skillshttpgoogllmemd   If somebody told me that book written in horses POV would be this emotional I wouldnt have believed itFrom page one I knew that this wasnt going to be happy and light read even in chapter  so much happened It dealt with war and how unfair and stupid it is But it also dealt with so much more than that Its a story about friendship loyalty love and survival And I felt like this book was so much longer than it actually was I guess that is because so much happened in it But surprisingly even though it was short not one part of this book felt rushed at least to meNow off to see the movie Hopefully itll stay faithful to the book   Small Books can often leave big impressions and this is the case with War Horse by Michael MorpurgoMichael Murpurgo writes wonderful childrens novels and I had loved some of his books very much and War Horse is one of those books that leaves a lasting impressionThis is not a novel with a complicated plot or twists and turns but a beautiful story simply told and I find sometimes these can be the best Warhorse is a moving story about a horse called Joey and his experiences during service in the first world war Joey a farmhorse is sold to the army and witnesses battle from both side of the trenches This book is aimed at the  year old marketbut can be enjoyed by readers of any age and the author really knows how to tell a story and how to educate his reader while doing so I found the war scenes appropriate for the age group this book was aimed at and yet enough to make the reader feel the horrors of warI loved the way Joey the horse seemed to give hope to the men on the battlefield and while war was all around them the horses gave the soldiers a sense of calm and hopeI bought this book for my ten year old and as the film War Horse is now showing in the cinema I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I really enjoyed this book One of my favourite books by Michael Murpurgo is Private Peaceful   I listened to this on audio and was listening to this while making my way to a gig at Wooster College in Ohio where I was to draw caricatures Drawing caricatures for the public requires a certain amount of upbeat interaction so it might not have been a good time to cry over Joey the War Horse I hope my Eyes werent all puffyJoey is a special horse Special enough to be purchased to serve in the first world war as a Calvary horse But the whole time he is in the war he longs for the day he can go home to his boy Albert Joey was sold to the war effort against Alberts wishes by his father and Albert vows to join up when hes old enough and bring his horse back against all odds Joeys time was not easy in the war Quite frankly he went through hell He suffers many losses along the way but he keeps going Will he find Albert Read it and find outThis is a wonderful little book   A book about war About fighting and survivingA book about friendship and loyalty And about death and grief and moving on Written from the POV of a horse this book was absolutely breathtaking And honetsly not only the book I cried when I read the book and I cried even harder when I watched the movieIt was one of the few books I read that was actually about WWI Since so many books are about the Second World War I was very intrigued about a book that pictured the First oneThe main part is of course Joey and how he survived during the war how he helped and how human beings actually helped him He was such an observing and loyal and caring and loving character I am very sceptical about animal POVs but this one was remarkably beautiful I would choose Joey over nearly every other book protagonist But then there was also Joeys particular strong bound to some of them like first and foremost Albert Albert taught Joey things that saved his life more than just once Besides Albert promised to find him he was his first and most important friend Then there was the very gentle and wise Captain Nicholls who reminded me on an older version of Albert and Major Stewart with his horse Topthorn who soon became Joeys best friend during the war Every character who was mentioned in the book was in its own way important and showed a particular view on life and the war Every single character actually loved and appreciated the horses everyone cared This book was short but it was strong and it was beautiful I loved every sentence every word and every character and plot twist I highly recommend the book to everyone and I also recommend the movie that turned out to be a little bit different than the book but it was still breathtaking    "},

and true  event Iraqs attempted mortar attack on the British war cabinet at  Downing Street in February  Very mixed feelings on this one As an actionadventure thriller its certainly intriguing enough to sustain interest throughout Its a unique style in which the protagonist is the bad guy and whilst there is almost equal time given to those hunting him down I think were supposed to root for the terrorist here I suspect he becomes less bad in subsequent books but here were talking about a guy that signs up to kill one or more leading figures in British Parliament in the late searly sIts a fictionalised account of what led up to the mortar attack on Downing Street and thus it features some real life political figures Thats fine but I was a bit uncomfortable with having them play such prominant speaking roles Reading what John Major didnt say or what Saddam Hussein probably said many times in his life doesnt make for happy reading for me And if that is meant to be the actual Gordon Brown well there are no wordsI dont quite understand the motivation behind it because the disclaimer at the end says characters and events are either fiction or fictionalised but all similarities are coincidental You cant have it both ways surely You cant write words into the mouth of John Major Prime Minister and then say its a coincidence that hes like John Major actual Prime MinisterThat was quite a big problem for me but if we put that aside it was a good thriller There were some key things that made it slightly less believable  characters that would never spill out their whole plan before killing someone or failing to kill them so the plan goes back to the other side the maverick attitude of the good guys with their planes and their guns and their covering everything up and the

attack from the air and a land invasion was imminently expected The Provisional IRA engineered the attack which mirrored its tactics in Northern Ireland Instead Higgins puts the blame on a former Provisional IRA hit man named Sean Dillon working as a mercenary for the KGB and its client Saddam HusseinSaddam Hussein gets the blameEye of the Storm reflects the historical record in many respects including the details of the attack The fanciful hinge on which the story turns is the role of Saddam Hussein who appears as a minor character in the novel The hardened mercenary Sean Dillon takes the honors at the center of the plot Two other favorite characters from Higgins stable round out the cast Martin Brosnan and even the now aging Liam Devlin both of them reformed exIRA terrorists now reincarnated as university professors The threeway relationship among Dillon Brosnan and Devlin is at the heart of the story All three and even the many lesser characters in the novel are brilliantly drawn their personalities leap off the page Higgins tells the tale with supreme command of pacing and momentum building suspense steadily to a crescendo He makes terrorism credibleAbout the

"text": "This is the successful account of Colditz famous PoW camp as seen from the German side Eggers was on the staff there for the greater part of the war in charge of security  relates how he discharged with varying success his duty of preventing escapes  starsI want to make one thing clear I enjoyed this book I found it very interesting It was great to hear about the castle and its prisoners from the view of the German staff Also the information about what was happening in Germany politically at the time there were things mentioned I had not read in other books regarding Colditz I also warmed to Eggers and feel he was a good man I didnt enjoy this as much as The Colidtz Story or The latter days at Colditz by Pat Reid and I think that was because I already knew the main incidents at Colditz from those books I learnt some new stuff but quite a bit of it I had already read about before I also did not find it as funny as the other books although it had its moments of humour I dont know if it was the translation but at times it did not read smoothly for me I was quite tired when I read it so this may have hindered my enjoyment of itI recommend this book for those with an interest in Colditz and even those without I enjoyed it and found it very interesting probably if it is the first book about Colditz you have read you may end up rating it higher     The Colditz camp was for those prisoners of war that spend all their time plotting escape and could not be contained in regular camps An medieval castle was probably not the best place to pick for a highsecurity prison though The Allied soldiers in Colditz built a glider and countless tunnels dressed like women and German soldiers pretended to be sick or ran away with a almosthealed broken leg created primitive binoculars and warning systems They did everything imaginable and unimaginable to try and escape from the camp They even found an actual secret tunnel that was build hundreds of years ago while digging one of their own tunnels Many many times they were caught while still inside or just after they left but they still kept trying Meanwhile in the middle of losing a war the Germans accused an Englishman of calling the Germans bastards brought him before a judge and had him convicted to jailtime Likewise for the French soldiers throwing water and pumpkins at them Apparently that kind of thing is not allowed under the Geneva convention This book describes what happened at Colditz from the point of view of a German Reinhold Eggers himself who was promoted to security officer at Colditz in the later stages of the war I found myself rooting for him and his team from time to time before I remembered which side he was on For this it helped that the Germans in this book werent complete sociopaths or even remotely evil which is quite different from most warbooks Eggers describes the daily routine the increasingly baffling plots to escape and the development of the war and its direct influences on the lives of him and his men in a detached style Still the frustration because of succesfull attempts is visible Eggers took his job very seriously apparentlyI will definitely be reading more about Colditz    Immortalised in the TV series Colditz by the character of Hauptman Ullmann Reinhold Eggers was one of the Security Officers at Kriegsgefangenenoffizierssonderlager C sorry just love that word from  until its capture by American Forces in April  As an internationalist and teacher he spent the years between his release from the army in  and  forging links with schools and groups in the UK and France and it was only being denounced to the new Nazi authorities that stopped these trips On his recall to the army in  his language skills made him a useful translator and led to him being posted to a POW camp at Hohnstein The first section of this book discusses how this training at Hohnstein could never have prepared him for the inveterate escape artists he would encounter in Coldirz The rest oof the book is a reasonably chronological breakdown of the various escape attempts as seen from the German forces attempting to stop them It would seem that Eggers respected a good number of the wouldbe escapees and treated them with dignity admittedly this is a book written by the man himself and could be seen as apologist in its reading of events however it was edited by one of the former prisoners and given the foreword that This man was our opponent but nevertheless he earned our respect by his correct attitude selfcontrol and total lack of rancour despite all the harassment we gave him A number of former prisoners spoke for the man during his postwar trial and subsequent imprisonment by Soviet authorities and it seems to be agreed that he really was a pretty decent individual trying to do the best he could in difficult timesThe book is well written with a huge range of material being covered however I would recommend that some prior knowledge of events at the camp could be useful before reading this mainly because several are referred to throughout the text It is amusing that Eggers often remained baffled by how escapes were carried out right up until he read the story from the view point of the prisoners If you have any familiarity with the TV show that was heavily based on Pat Reids Colditz Story then you will recognise a number of the escapes mentioned here The nationalities may have been altered a little the TV show SERIOUSLY simplified things leaving out the Dutch and Belgian prisoners entirely for example and having the UK contingent a pretty homogeneous group instead of the mishmash of commonwealth nations from Canadians to Maoris that actually resided in the Castle but the facts remain the same Either way it is fascinating for a Brit to have the story from such a unique German point of view   "},

"text": "Colditz was the last stop for prisoners of war in the Second World War It was to this impregnable fortress that the Germans sent all those prisoners who persisted in escaping from other camps such as Stalag Luft III of THE GREAT ESCAPE FAME Once within the walls of Colditz the Germans reasoned escape was impossible And yet during the fouryear period when the castle was used as a prison over  men escaped  of whom managed to complete the hazardous journey home through Germany Prisoners from  different countries formed a truly international escape academy Skeleton keys were made German passes forged maps drafted and all manner of tools and machinery constructed out of whatever the prisoners had to hand The ingenuity of the escape artists knew no bounds they tried everything from tunnelling to hiding in rubbish sacks disguising themselves as German officers and leaping acrobatically from the castle walls I think my expectations of this book made it not as good as I hoped it would be Then again I didnt quite know what to expect of it I think there couldve been lesser people introduced they all got quite mixed up for me Then again it was not that much about the characters the book It was about POWs prisoner of war during second world war in a castle an a town called Colditz It was about what had actually happened it did not feel like a book wanting to tell a great story but a book that was about the story that happened and how it happened truly back in s For me it was an eye opener in many ways I would have thought that prisoners would have been treated worse than what the book made it sound like An obviously it wasnt like this for all Like always with the subject of world wars I always find it very hard to believe it actually happened and it wasnt that long ago not really I was amazed by the things these POWs came up with to help people try their escapes I guess people muster all their abilities possible to use when faced with a situation where trying all one can is the only way to survive When Pat escaped and was already out of Colditz he realises what has actually happened and then only understands what it means and what they all meant to him If anyone wants to read what it was like in Colditz or rather about the escape attempts this does tell you a lot about them At times I was irritated by not understanding every last word I felt that to really understand the escapes I shouldve understood all the little things that were happening Maybe then I couldve been more excited and thus given the book  starsI felt like it took really long for me to finish this book I think I just picked it up at a wrong time I was actually feeling like something lighter to read This is a good example that you should never pick up a book if its something complete different than what youre feeling likeI APPRENTICEPrologueIIIThe prologue made me smile which has to be a good thing The book starts before he goes to ColditzAll this snooping and test escape plans are getting me quite excited Feel like playing a little escape from colditz So they are making a tunnel climbing route did not work Finally they escape but only  out of the original  get out on the first try They get caught halfway to Yugoslavia They learn other  had escaped and caught as well They spent a week back in camp before they were sent to ColditzII ESCAPE OFFICERIVVIDoes not feel like the quickest read but that could be just because I dont really feel like reading So they arrive in Colditz and they are welcomed by the Poles who are the majority They are greeted also by Canadians some French and Belgian POWs arrive as well The Germans try to keep them apart but fail and give up tryingIts strange to read about all these activities they had in Colditz And money They had money that they used to buy musical instruments and all that Strange So they had sports and they had card games and board games and theatre and musicalsThey unlocked the door and unhinged it to be carried around HeheI really like how they are making the Germans look stupid Reappearing to appel after missing oneVIIIXThey get caught Damn it I do sometimes has trouble understanding the little things they are doing to escape and they should be understood I think but I try not to let it disturb meOne of them escape inside a mattres some french pows are taking to town He gets all the way to Vienna but then has nothing left to stay alive and escape and is caught and brought back Hmm I dont always know who hes telling about that annoys me a littleXXIIWow all the things they can do in there Brewing liquor He has spent a lot of time in solitary again and in there he gets a new idea the theatre Will this become a successful escape somehowXIIIXVIIts quite amazing all these things they have come up with I must say I dont believe I couldve And the boldness its taken them But they used all the chances they found and were given Just quite unimaginableIII ESCAPEXVIIXXIepilogueSo few of them succeed And when they do it is only a matter of days that they can cross the borderIf this were a fiction book it would not get me that excited   The amazing true story of the men imprisoned in Colditz Castle surely the most impressive prisonerofwar camp in modern historyThe prisoners sent to Colditz had all escaped before from other camps and were sent there because it was considered escapeproof  ha The Germans mistake of course was to concentrate all that energy and skill in one place so the prisoners were not so much concerned with whether they could escape but whether they could beat their fellow prisoners to the drawBritish American French Polish Dutch and Belgian and probably others  cant remember if there were any Russians competed for this privilege and their plans had to be agreed and scheduled by the Escape Committee to prevent clashes and people trying to escape at the same timeMaking uniforms and trying to walk out the gate cutting through floors to gain access to empty rooms tunneling into the drains and even building a glider in an attic  their schemes were myriad and ingeniousThe stories the mens feelings the upsets dramas German searches and the occasional successes they are all laid out here in glorious detail You will feel their pain discomfort lack of food as well as their joy over a game of football or their ecstasy after a successful escapePity too the poor German officers and guards who had the unenviable task of managing hundreds of fit young men all of whom had nothing to do but plan their escape They had to try to keep them happy whilst maintaining discipline and trying to keep their Nazi overlords contented a thankless task that saw quite a bit of understanding and appreciation between prisoners and guardsThis is an exciting entertaining read and a first hand historical account of a fascinating and concentrated event in history hence five starsThis is a shorter version of Pat Reids book The full story has recently been published by The Folio SocietyIf you get a chance watch the fantastic BBC series made in the seventies from this book It stars David McCallum Robert Wagner Bernard Hepton Patrick Troughton and Jeremy Kemp among many others   Very good true story about Colditz By P R Reid How there lives were within colditz castle after being taken POWS during WW Hundreds of Men in one place trapped with a desire to get out by any means possible then best option was to tunnel out but this was no easy task so they had to dig the tunnels when possible or try and walk out the camp past German guards who patrolled the gates and castle  hours a dayseeing to do the impossible they made it possible some men did others didntGreat true story highly recommend if you love WW escape stories    Awesome I want to escape  It is nothing to compare what want  ingenuity can do Its also telling to that guide for the future of any reader allied or other just how an escapee planned and distracted their captors I read this as a one volume as the other part wasa separately published book Latter Days At Colditz which described in more detail the individuals the author had come to know in the camp Its was very interesting and also emotional to feel the authors words of want for freedom  logic therein   Originally published on my blog here in October The Colditz Story is the tale of the British prisoners of war incarcerated in Oflag IV C Colditz Castle which was used to hold officers who had already attempted to escape from other camps by the Germans during the Second World War Reid as Escape Officer coordinator of escape attempts helped organise many escapes and was in an ideal position to document them The book covers the period from Reids arrival as Colditz was being set up to his own successful escape to Switzerland a couple of years laterThe story of the ingenious escape attempts from Colditz are almost as famous as that of The Great Escape and the book was immensely successful not just becoming a TV series which this edition was released to tie in with but a board game which I remember playing in the seventies The book used to be in just about every library including school libraries in the UK I dont know if it is this popular today but it is noticeable that the public libraries I use still have a Second World War section which is much larger than the rest of history put together so similar tales continue to hold the imagination of the British public This means that it will have been read by any voracious male it almost certainly appeals more to boys reader of my age or older and many more will have seen the TV show I was a few years too young to see it myself The story told by Reid is very memorable and I found myself remembering details I hadnt read for thirty yearsReid immortalises a particular kind of heroics which is also one stereotypically associated with the products of the British public school system It is all about the battle of wits with the Germans and the game effectively become more important than the ends Clausewitz is frequently quoted as saying that War is the continuation of politics by other means It is in fact a slight misquotation But to Pat Reid and others like him usually enthusiastic products of an English public school it would be more correct to suggest that was was the continuation of the sports field by other means However the value of an escape to anyone other than the escapee was in the end not in the chess game which led to itSo is is really the duty of every prisoner of war to attempt to escape Reid takes it for granted that this is the case so much so that he doesnt even discuss the officers reasons for making achingly difficult escape attempts such as carrying out such a convincing simulation of insanity that the escapee risked suffering mental damage as a result According to Wikipedias list there were  successful escapees from Colditz  of them British This is a vanishingly small number among the wars combatants and it is not likely that any of them would have been so effective individually that their escape would have made a direct military difference to the outcome of the war This argument doesnt hold so well for other nationalities such as the French and Belgians whose home countries were occupiedThe only conceivable benefit to the war effort from a successful escape that I can see would be through morale boosting propaganda Im not saying that this would be a negligible benefit but another thing which Reid doesnt mention is what the escapees did on returning home First British escapee Airey Neave went on to work for MI the British secret service in charge of aiding resistance movements in occupied Europe but he was by a long way the most distinguished of the escapees and probably the best known British inmate with the exception of Douglas Bader Reid himself was unable to return to Britain until after the war Others were killed in action or their escape remained the major event of their war service Nothing I can see in Wikipedia entries not necessarily the most authoritative source but easily accessible suggests that the British used escapees for propaganda purposes Compared to the work of SOE the activities of Schindler or the dedication of the Bletchley code breakers POW escapes were extremely unimportant in the history of the War If it does not serve the overall aim of winning the war in any particular way it is surely not a duty bound on every prisoner of warCompared to many prisoners of war those incarcerated in Colditz were not particularly ill treated Food was sparse but that was something fairly commonplace in wartime Germany  and it should be remembered that the Nazi regime was not a signatory to the international convention which governed the treatment of prisoners of war and yet the regime at Colditz seems to have respected the conventions rules  they had exercise access to primitive medical care and even received parcels from home The imprisoned officers were not forced to work themselves to death or used for medical experimentation or killed in large numbers as Jewish prisoners were They were certainly very well treated compared those British soldiers captured by the Japanese And in more modern times the Americans who suffered sleep deprivation in the Gulf or the terrorist suspects waterboarded by the CIA were worse off So bad treatment was also not a big motive for escapeAnother question which occurred to me that passed me by thirty years ago was whether escapes like those detailed here would be possible now Reid says at several points that he is suppressing details so that the same tricks could be reused without the authorities in the camp being aware of them in advance  he obviously expects the inmates to be more clever than the guards in terms of reading between the lines But a lot has changed in almost sixty years There was no electronic surveillance in fact the use of microphones hidden around Colditz to detect tunnelling was probably the first move in this direction So there were no cameras no use of biometrics it was even possible to use handmade plaster statues to hide the absence of inmates at roll calls no electronic keys on doors no automatic closing of doors when alarms were sounded and so on However we have all of these in prisons today and yet there are still escaped criminals so perhaps it would still be possible to get out of a POW campReid is a product of his class and time There are so many details in his writing which indicate this one which is symptomatic is the way that whenever he introduces a new character he lists the school invariably a public school which says something about how the British armed forces chose officers sixty years ago attended by the prisoner Where the school is not one of the best known Eton Harrow Rugby etc this is not going to tell the reader much unless they also went to a public schoolReids style is unpolished not that of a journalist or novelist He consistently uses unvarying derogatory slang the Germans are always Gerries the guards are always goons and so on He is an extremely keen user of exclamation marks something which I find particularly irritating when reading But on the whole the interest of the stories overcomes all the difficulties and makes The Colditz Story a good read   "},

"text": "Kurt Vonneguts absurdist classic SlaughterhouseFive introduces us to Billy Pilgrim a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore In a plotscrambling display of virtuosity we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life concentrating on his and Vonneguts shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of DresdenDont let the ease of reading fool you  Vonneguts isnt a conventional or simple novel He writes There are almost no characters in this story and almost no dramatic confrontations because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces One of the main effects of war after all is that people are discouraged from being charactersSlaughterhouseFive is not only Vonneguts most powerful book it is also as important as any written since  Like Catch  it fashions the authors experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority SlaughterhouseFive boasts the same imagination humanity and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonneguts other works but the books basis in rockhard tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy  and humor There are some terrible reviews of SH floating around Goodreads but one particularly awful sentiment is that SlaughterhouseFive isnt antiwarThis is usually based on the following quote For context Mr Rumfoord is an old military historian described as hateful and cruel who wants to see weaklings like Billy exterminatedOn Tralfamadore Billy was introduced to the revelation that all things happen exactly as they do and that they will always happen that way and that they will never happen any other way Meaning time is all at once The aliens incidentally admit to destroying the universe in a comical accident fated far into the future and theyre very sorry but so it goes  passive acceptanceThe entire story up to this point has been about Billy buffeted like a powerless pathetic leaf in a storm pushed this way and that by forces entirely outside his tiny purview He lays catatonically in a hospital bed after the plane crash and the death of his wife and all the time traveling back and forth from Dresden where toddlers and families and old grannies and antiwar civilians were burned alive in a carefully organized inferno so it goes and Billy is about ready to agree to absolutely anything It cant be prevented It cant be helpedYoure powerless after a while What hope have we or anyone caught in the middle of a war or even the poor soldiers who are nothing but pawns and children hence the childrens crusade to influence these gigantic global events Therefore Billy agrees with the hateful the cruel Mr Rumfoord who is revising his military history of WWII having previously forgotten to mention the Dresden bombing which cost twice as many innocent lives as the nuking of Hiroshima Women and children not evaporated instantly but melted slowly by chemicals and liquid flame their leftovers according to Billy lying in the street like blackened logs or in piles of families who died together in their little homes Incidentally how can anything be prowar or antiwar Because being antiwar is a bit like being anticonflict antideath and antisuffering Is there a book thats pro these things Is there a book that touches on the subject of war and is not against itWe dont support wars though we are sometimes forced to accept them Anyone who thinks that the bombing of Dresden was necessary is delusionalIts like saying yo look how they bombed these innocents  that shit was wrong Lets go bomb some innocents tooThats the sad truth of it   I miss Kurt VonnegutHe hasnt been gone all that long Of course he isnt gone yet he is gone He has always been alive and he will always be dead So it goesSlaughterhousefive is next to impossible to explain let alone review but here I am And here I goWhat is it aboutIts about warIts about love and hateIts about post traumatic stress Its about sanity and insanityIts about aliens not the illegal kind the spacey kindIts about lifeIts about deathso it goesThats one thing Earthlings might learn to do if they tried hard enough Ignore the awful times and concentrate on the good ones This is how I live my life This is how I get through the day Most days I am successful some days Im not Today is one of the not days Like so many Americans these days I feel Im in a rut Like so many Americans I dont understand why I am where I am This was not the plan This was not what I had in mind Oh poor meboo hoo This book This book got me thinking So much about life sucks true but not many of us want to give up on it that easy Why because of the good ones And what makes good ones is our ability to create and enjoy creatingat least I think soWrite it Shoot it Publish it Crochet it saut it whatever MAKE Joss WhedonIf you make something a painting a poem a novel a good meal a personyou continue to live even after death I think thats what Mr Vonnegut was getting at MaybeAt least that is how he has remained alive for me   I have to admit to being somewhat baffled by the acclaim Slaughterhouse has received over the years Sure the story is interesting It has a fascinating and mostly successful blend of tragedy and comic relief And yes I guess the fractured structure and timetravelling element must have been quite novel and original back in the day But that doesnt excuse the books flaws of which there are a great many in my seemingly unconventional opinion Take for instance Vonneguts endless repetition of the phrase So it goes Wikipedia informs me it crops up  times in the book It felt like three hundred times to me About forty pages into the book I was so fed up with the words So it goes that I felt like hurling the book across the room something I have not done since trying to read up on French semiotics back in the s I got used to coming across the words every two pages or so eventually but I never grew to like them God no I found some other nits to pick too Some of them were small and trivial and frankly rather ridiculous such as  wait for it  the hyphen in the books title Seriously what is that hyphen doing there Theres no need for a hyphen there Couldnt someone have removed it like  editions ago And while Im at it couldnt some discerning editor have done something about the monotonous quality of Vonneguts prose  about the interminable repetition of short subjectverbobject sentences Dont get me wrong Im not saying all authors should use Henry James or Claire Messudlength sentences Heaven forbid Im actually rather fond of minimalism both in visual art and in writing But Vonneguts prose is so sparse and simplistic its monotonous rather than minimalist to the point where I frequently found myself wishing for a runon sentence every now and then or for an actual indepth description of something I hardly ever got either As a result there were times when I felt like I was reading a barebones outline of a story rather than the story itself Granted it was an interesting outline larded with pleasing ideas and observations but still I think the story could have been told in a more effective way A less annoying way tooAs for the plot I liked it I liked the little vignettes Vonnegut came up with and the colourful characters he created the British officers being my particular favourites I liked the fact that youre never quite sure whether Billy is suffering from dementia brain damage or some kind of delayed posttraumatic stress disorder or whether there is some actual timetravelling going on I even liked the jarring switches in perspective although I think they could have been handled in a slightly more subtle manner And I liked the books antiwar message weak and defeatist though it seemed to be In short I liked the book but it took some doing I hope Ill be less annoyed by the two other Vonnegut books I have sitting on my shelves Breakfast of Champions and Cats Cradle   I read this book first in  when my grandfather passed away It was a bit of a coincidence as his funeral occurred between a Primate Anatomy exam and a paper for my Experimental Fiction class on Slaughterhouse Five I was frantically trying to remember the names of all kinds of bones when I picked this up in the other hand and tried to wrap my head around itBasically Vonnegut has written the only Tralfamadorian novel I can think of These beings most undoubtedly inspired in Billy Pilgrims head by the scattered science fiction plots of Kilgore Trout experience time as a continuum that is constantly occurringand when they look at time even though in their version of history the world is in a constant state of being destroyed for example they choose to see the things that make them happythe good moments What Billy learns from these creatures is that each traumatic event that has happened in his life fits very precisely into a state of meticulous nature It has always happened and always will happen and so it goes on and on and on What Billy Pilgrim truly experiences over and over in his life is Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome He exists throughout his memories traveling back and forth with the knowledge of what will happen and how precise it all is Dresden is bombed in every moment and his friend Derby is put in front of a firing squad At every second he is the only survivor of a plane wreck he is getting married and he is fighting a Childrens Crusade Its the only way he can look at the despair that has happened and make sense of itWhen my grandfather died and I read this I felt as if it was just what I needed because I could escape back into time and remember the good memories of my grandfatherif they existed even if in some fourth dimension then he was just as dead as he was alive and eating peanut butter chocolate ice cream At the same time my grandfather had a heart attack I was watching him play cards with my grandma at the kitchen table But which one to think of Well that was easy Death cant be prevented and so it goes but you can always try to change which moment you live in Its a little bit different than a memory and if you go far into it youll end up like Billy Pilgrim which is to say you will go insane because the rest of the world sees time as linear and counts seconds and minutes and hoursOnce and awhile it doesnt hurt I reread this again on the plane rides home and back before and after my grandmothers funeral on Monday and last night My grandma was a strong and intelligent woman and she always read everything she saw My recent memories of my grandmother were of her at the holidays She always had her mind but her physical condition had deteriorated and she was dependent on oxygen It made me sad to think of her like this a bit Its really hard for me to think that my grandma is no more but then I tell myselfwell its silly for me to keep crying on and on about this My grandma is right now reading at am in her living room chair and I am a child creeping down the stairs hoping shes still up She is telling me that one day Ill come around and like green onions She is reminding me to keep my feet off of the davenport and about being tickled by something She lives in a jungle of houseplants and watches musicals all of the time always pointing out when some distant relative of mine appears briefly in The Greatest Show on Earth My grandma cant be dead and be doing all of those things can she It doesnt make sense She will always be alive in some moments just like I will always be seven and nine and twenty eight and perhaps past thirty and forty So shell always be hereI just wish I could dream about her   I finally read Vonnegut I finally read a war novel And after a long time I finally read something with so many GR ratings and a decent number of reviews which is precisely the reason I have nothing much to add to the already expressed views here So I urge you to indulge me to state a personal anecdote Thank YouMy Grandfather was a POW during IndoChina war and remained in confinement for some six months By the time I got to know about it I had already watched too many movies and crammed endless number of answers about when and where such n such war was fought But I was nave and lets assume innocent and someone who was yet to learn to ask the right questions So the fact that someone so close in the family had witness something I only read in schoolbooks was utterly fascinating for me Thus began my streak of stupid questionsMe Did you kill someone Did they torture you Did you dig some sort of tunnel to escape And so onMy Grandpa gave this hearty laugh he is famous for and said that Im missing one important question Why the war happened at first place I thought for a while and answered Because it always happens I cant recall properly what he replied to that but it was something on the lines of this I wish the answer changes when youll grow up because as of now thats exactly how it is War always happens With books like SlaughterhouseFive Schlachthffnf its not the writing which matters but simply the ideas and thoughts it carries which transgresses the literary boundaries and create a place in the heart of the readers as a humble reminder that Love happens Hate happens Life happens Death happens Peace happens War happens and sometimes Shit happens   "},

"text": "Prime minister of the political thriller Len Deighton is back in top form with the first of a new trilogy in the continuing saga of Bernard Samson the intrepid insolent and enigmatic agent of Deightons blockbuster series the Game Set and Match and Hook Line and Sinker trilogies In Faith Samson is beset After her years on the other side his wife Fiona is finally back in his life But the cool and sophisticated Fiona cant help but know about the affair with Gloria an attractive coworker half Bernards age And Bernard has other troubles like his secret orders to leave California for the grim streets of Magdeburg where hours after his arrival he finds himself in a shootout with Stasi agents on a dark country roadanother airtight mission down the drain At the time of darkest danger Bernard needs his best friend Werner but Werner is exiled and in disgrace I read some elses review of Spy Sinker which I admit was a bit of a disappointment because it was an eye of God tale explaining much of what our hero Bernard Samson did not know from the first five books The review said that they would not bother to go on and read the last trilogy Faith Hope and Charity What a treat he or she missed Bernard as usual is out on a limb trying to find out what his brotherinlaw George is doing and getting an inside track on events in Central office from his friend Werner and finally trying to extract VERDI a possible Russian defector from East Germany As usual nothing goes as it should do and as usual Bernard is always one step ahead of everyone else despite the fact that his wife in now back in London and is working for his boss Dicky Cruyer Whether you have chosen to do what I have done which is to read all the Samson books in order or not if you like spy novels dont miss this one   This next book in the Bernard Samson series sees him return to London following the debriefing of his wife and the death of his sisterinlaw during the daring return of Londons deepest spy in East Germany And as usual Samson is dealing with the major characters having their own personal agendas and whilst at the same time he has to cope with the upheavals that the events of the past have wrought in both his professional and personal life The espionage angle is down beat cold war where spying for England is the name of the game and right and wrong seem very black and white However this book sees Samsons personal life driving much of the story and as always Deighton handles it so well deftly avoiding the predictable melodrama of a love triangle and allowing the characters to grow and react as the story progresses Leaving as always at the beginning of a new trilogy more questions than answers and the reader hungry for more Bring on the next book   Originally published on my blog here in December The third and final trilogy about Bernard Samson follos more or less straight on from the concluding moments of the preceding novels skipping over only the months of recovery and debriefing on a remote Californian ranch that follow the escape of Bernards wife Fiona from East Berlin where she has been a highly placed agent of the British Secret Service The setting is still in the days before the demolishing of the Wall The confusion left to be sorted out is immense  Bernard for example had been living with another woman believing that Fiona was a defecting traitor Fionas sister Tess has apparently been killed in the fight on the autobahn linking Berlin to the West that was organised to cover Fionas escape rumours are flying round the Secret Service and no one has any idea what Fionas role will be when and if she returns to work Deighton left few loose ends at the end of London Match the final novel in the first trilogy but little is resolved in Spy Sinker by contrast  it is much more obvious that the story would have to continueThere are really two strands to Faith one of which initially doesnt seem to be connected to the main narrative This is a mission that Bernard is sent on to East Germany to make contact with an officer who has secrets to sell to the West The other is a private investigation into what happened on the night of the fight and to Tessas body launched by her husband this is clearly going to make waves by attempting to uncover secrets that others will want to keep hiddenWhile the story naturally grows out of what has gone before there are some changes of emphasis We are back here with Bernard as a narrator which works better than the third person used in Spy Sinker More oddly there has been an important change in emphasis which has been made without comment Earlier the point of the fight was to make it look as though Fiona had been killed so that the East Germans and Russians dont know that she was working against them all this time But now she and Bernard are openly living in the Mayfair flat that belonged to Tessa and she is starting a high profile job in the London office  surely not something that will be overlooked by the Russian and East German agents still in London no matter how much their respective countries are sliding into the economic chaos that was the penultimate stage in the fall of Soviet CommunismFaith is one of the more downbeat Deighton novels even in a series which focuses on betrayal It is low key because like Mexico Set in the first trilogy it is about picking up the pieces after a trauma and starting again   Bernard Samson has his wife back Fiona has returned from her years as a defector behind the Iron Curtain and theyre both back in London after being debriefed in California and given a chance to recover from the climactic events of Spy Sinker But neither of them will be the same Bernards affair with Gloria a coworker half his age has to be addressed and Fiona has to fit back in to the world of the top floor of the Service Then theres the kids  how will they deal with their mothers return after believing that for years she had defected to the Communists Bernard too is busy trying to retrieve a Russian agent named Verdi who is anxious to come over to the West But from the start the operation does not go as plannedI knew going in that this would not be able to reach the heights of Spy Sinker which I loved so that perhaps helped me enjoy it more than I might have Bernard is in fine form here with his alwaysapt descriptions and not shying away from his own weaknesses at least when other people point them out Hes starting to feel his age though the young field agent hes partnered with on the initial operation judges him as certainly not young and his kids are now  and  no longer small enough to be given piggyback rides He also has much narrower escapes than he would like from various enemies making him think hes lost his touch As a middleaged spy Bernard is a realistic creation and an endearing one too Am I the only one who thinks it kind of adorable that he works for the Service just like his dad and that he works with a lot of his fathers old colleagues some of whom keep an eye out for him because they promised his father that they wouldThe humour is also very much in evidence I almost laughed out loud at Bernards description of Brets desk which was compared to Brets women ultra modern with shiny legs black drawers and seethrough top Much of Bernards description has a wry edge too And I was quite amused by his son Billy wanting to be a curator at a gun museum Or a car museumOverall I enjoyed this book especially the fastpaced ending and am looking forward to the next installment in the series   The first book of the third Bernard Samson trilogy in which London Central hatches a plan to enroll a KGB man code name VERDI who claims he can help them hack into the KGBs computer network And as usual most of the major characters have their own agendas and Samson has to deal with and work around all of them whilst at the same time cope with the upheavals that the events of the previous two books have wrought in both his professional and personal life The espionage angle is fine but its the latter aspect that drives much of the story and Deighton handles it well deftly avoiding the predictable melodrama I was expecting regarding the love triangle of Bernard his wife Fiona and his girlfriend Gloria On the downside a few of the changes that happen between the previous trilogy and this one seem a little contrived if not forced Still looking forward to the next installment    "},

regulations There are collaborators There are profiteers But there are others working in hope in secret and desperate danger against the invader And still others are living strangely ambiguous lives  none more so than Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer Archer of the yard as the press like to call him trying to maintain a peculiarly almost sacredly British institution under a Nazi chief Archer has started work on what seems at first a routine murder case But suddenly an SS Standartenfhrer from Himmlers personal staff flies in from Berlin to supervise the investigation and Archer is plunged deep into an espionage battle for which he is completely unprepared and where the stakes are incredibly high Were dealing with something that could prove so deadly that not even the Black Death would

collaborators highlevel scientists German army and SS factions and vicious rivalry a beautiful American reporter on assignment for the stillneutral papers back home  these are the players that Deightons treacherously shifting drama as it races toward its chattering climax that involves the fate of the King and of England itselfSSGB is fascinating in its premise utterly authentic and convincing in its detail It is the most gripping novel we have had from the author of The Ipcress File Funeral in Berlin and Bomber Already in England it has become Len Deightons greatest best seller In  we are swamped with alternative history novels andor series In my opinion what was once an fun little genre has become overloaded and overdone Its become commercialized and much of the fun has been sucked out as a result Of course the other possibility is that Ive just gotten older and my tastes have changed Whatever the reason for my feelings regarding the AH genre I do still enjoy the occasional foray into the field SSGB was one of the first AH novels that I ever read and it was also one of the first AH novels to enjoy mainstream popularity Not the first but one of the firstBy  Len Deighton was a well known author of both fiction primarily espionage novels and nonfiction World War II Many of his books had been bestsellers since he had his first book The Ipcress File was published in  but SSGB was a change of pace for himI have no doubt its popularity helped to spur on writers like Harry Turtledove and SM Stirling in their AH endeavors as well Also Robert Harriss well known  novel Fatherland owes much to this novelAfter twentytwo years I read SSGB again I have recently read a couple of Deightons earlier spy novels from the sixties and I wanted to see how the novel had aged Im pleased to say that its held up very well Deighton wrote a murder mysteryespionage novel set in Nazi occupied Britain  A careful researcher Deighton makes the setting of the novel feel real There are no over the top super charged heroicsOur hero like previous Deighton protagonists is more of an observer of events  though he does get involved near the endIn other words Deighton wrote a classic British mystery novelonly with Nazis running around in an England that is now controlled by them Its a good read Its biggest achievement is showing that even in a conquered Britain life goes on and our hero has a murder investigation to work Hes a professional and hes going to do his job Unlike authors who came later in the AH field Deighton has no political knives to sharpen with this story He wasnt out to show how this world his world would have been so much better if only events or political doctrines had happened differently Say like The Probability Broach by L Neil Smith which is just a political tract in the guise of a novel Its an easy novel to find and I say give it a try If you like classic British mystery stories youll like this one and if you do enjoy Alternative History books youll want to read SSGB if for no other reason than it was one of the first AH novels to enjoy mainstream popularity   I picked this up on a whim having head Deighton described as a master of the understated spy thriller This is that and more Even in Nazi occupied Germany peopled are shot and murderers have to be investigated But this being a novel nothing is simple and our protagonist Douglas Archer finds himself drawn into a deadly web of intrigue between factions in the SS Wehrmacht and the struggling British Resistance The characters and plot are nothing that stands out but thats all part of the subtle English charm of the book It is a very very gray novel Even the Nazis refuse to be cast as genocidal monsters merely selfinterested conquerors who are taking advantage of the moment to loot everything not nailed down And of course there is little honor or glory in collaborationeven collaboration which might soften the iron grip of the Third Reich And as for the setting its great alternate history It skips the part when Operation Sea Lion works military history consensus lol nope to focus on the bitter aftermath of life under occupation and trying to salvage some sort of dignity from the wreckage of defeat Great book lots of fun if that level of grimness is your thing    Proitao sam SSGB Lena Deightona izvorno podstaknut veu da BBC sprema ekranizaciju ali i dodatno inspirisan Ratkovim preporukama I zbilja uivao sam u ovom romanu SSGB kree kao klasian whodunit krimi i vremenom se transformie u pijunski roman ali zapravo kada se podvue crta formalno od poetka do kraja ostaje dosledno baziran na detektivskoj formi sa nadovezivanjem na povratnu strukturu krimia u vie navrataMeutim taj spoj detektivskog romana i pijunca nije jedino osveenje koje Deighton ovde uvodi Naime njegov roman se bavi alternativnom istorijom odnosno smeten je u London koji su  godine osvojili Nemci U okupiranoj Britaniji Skotland Jard radi za Nemce pod kontrolom SSa i glavni junak je nevoljni kvilsing koji smatra da je njegova dunost da iti narod od kriminalaca ak i kada je okupator na vlastiSam milje u koji je SSGB smeten a to je okupacija Britanije do koje nikada nije dolo otvara niz kontroverznih pitanja u vezi sa samom ideologijom romana Naime Deighton prilino ubedljivo uspeva da prikae psihologiju ljudi koji su se adaptirali na okupaciju ime na neki nain otupljuje tu zastraujuu dimenziju nacizma i prikazuje kao ga jo jednu zapravo birokratizovanu etaistiku ideju bez ikakve mistine snage to bi bilo u redu da je prikaz nacizma barem malo obuhvatio i njegove monstruozne zloine koji su nastali u sklopu same ideologije Naravno Deighton bi se uvek mogao braniti time da je ovo pria o ratu u kome Nemcima ide dobro i u kome se oni ne bi poduhvatili Holokausta ili barem ne u tom trenutku meutim injenica da su junaci uspeli da se prilagode nacistikoj okupaciji vrlo lako uspeva da zavede i itaocaDodue nemake okupacije na zapadu su bile znatno blae od onih gde nisu imali apsolutno nikakvo potovanje prema kulturi okupiranih dakle u slovenskim zemljama U tom smislu niz knjiga i filmova i svedoi o tome kako su Nemci bili znatno manje bezoni recimo prema Francuzima i Parizu kao graduNaravno moda je ta nepodnoljiva lakoa konformizma neto to je Deighton eleo da postigne i ako je to eleo onda je u tome i uspeo ali svakako da nema itanja ovog romana bez naglaavanja tog aspektaKako su nacisti prikazani kao okupatoribirokrate sa svim slabostima koje birokrate imaju roman se u velikoj meri bazira na unutarpolicijskoj odnosno

thriller transported into an alternative history world Nazi Germany had invaded Britain in February  British armed forces surrendered By November  Britain is completely occupied by the Germans life there is as pathetic as in occupied France in our timeline The King is under house arrest at the Tower of London Winston Churchill has been shot a Royal Navy Rear Admiral declared himself the leader of Free Britain in Halifax the way Charles de Gaulle declared himself the leader of Free France in London a year before both in our timeline and in the world of the novel If the King were somehow freed and taken to North America he would confer legitimacy on the Rear Admiral Storming the Tower is one thing Resistance fighters called terror fighters by the German occupiers try to do attacking the occupiers is another As Nazi Germanys Soviet allies are disinterring Karl Marx at Highgate Cemetery in order to rebury him at Lenins Mausoleum a bomb goes off killing many Germans and Soviets It is against this background that a Scotland Yard detective investigates a murder and eventually learns that the victim was a nuclear physicist the nuclear thread is the weakest part of the novel a character says that an atomic reactor cannot be built next to a river because it would release radioactive materials there in fact the worlds first industrialscale nuclear reactor the Hanford B reactor was built on the Columbia river upstream of Portland OR From there the investigation leads to a nuclear research facility in a fictional Devon seaside town employing both German and British physicists After unbelievably complicated intrigue which is probably a trope in such thrillers involving highly placed Germans Britons and Americans US Marines raid and destroy the nuclear research facility and the escaped King is killed by the Germans inching the United States and Nazi Germany closer to war in which the Americans will be the ones with the atomic bomb and which would result in an eventual liberation of Britain   This was the second time I have read SSGB and I believe I got more out of the novel a second time Although perhaps its just that I read novels with a more critical eye nowadays First of Deighton is without doubt one of the best I cant think of anyone else who reaches his heights apart from John Le Carre espionage thriller writers ever I remember reading his triple trilogies in the past and enjoying them thoroughly He is a profoundly technical writer and his strength lies in the twist and turns and Januslike deceptive atmosphere of the Cold War In this story Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer an unlikely posterboy and Sherlock Holmestype character for the Nazi rulers of Britain strives to uncover the cause behind the murder of a British atomic physicist Deighton has a superb and authoritative grasp of the geography and culture of London during the war era The Brits want to get the Americans involved in the war and deny the Nazis the chance to develop atomic capability Deighton also makes as one of his central themes the intense rivalry between the armed forces and the SS Its an excellent although at times a somewhat sluggish thriller ie a tendency to go into too much detail Occupied London is certainly a very drab place both psychologically and weatherwise and there is little with the exception of a quick romantic romp between Archer and American journalist Barbara Barga to lighten the mood This is obviously Deightons intention but makes the story a bit drab and diluted at times In the end the invalid King George VI is killed in a rescue and recovery of atomic documentation raid and Kellerman  the head Nazi honcho  outwits Huth his SS counterpart while Mayhew outwits Archer and achieving his goal of pulling the Americans into the war with the implication that the Allies with their superior atomic capability will go on to defeat the Nazis in the near future Note at this time Hitler has not yet invaded the USSR and the Germans and Russians are still pals I feel that the ending came rather quick and our hero ended up not being that much of hero at all Barbara Barga is clumsily killed by the Gestapo and within a chapter that subplot vanishes  with barely a reaction from Archer Next Deighton skips the action of the raid and ends with Huth now facing Kellermans firing squad doing a bit of a deus ex machina sketch by explaining what was going on the Archer Well first of all my opinion of our hero decreased somewhat not only because of his rather casual dismissal he didnt actually mention it but his or Deightons silence was the thunderous of the death of his new love Barbara but also as it now becomes clear he was in the dark most of the time to what was going on In the end it is the scheming Kellerman the elusive Mayhew and even to a certain extent Harry Woods who show themselves to be the real heroes of the tale our hero ends up second best at best For me at least it seems rather counterproductive to build up your hero only to see him overshadowed by the supporting cast I was reminded here too of Inspector Constantin Vadim of the Donald James series Vadim the alcoholic melancholic was a rather incompetent and shortsighted fellow at times but at least he was a human and emotional character I felt for him I felt nothing for Archer he was too technical a character Deighton is very adept at showing the inside machinations of the double and triplecross culture of the espionage world and he is very knowledgeable on English culture specifically the old boys club running the spy game and deceptiveness and manipulative nature of human beings   "},

"text": "Epic prelude to the classic spy trilogy GAME SET and MATCH that follows the fortunes of a German dynasty during two world warsWinter takes us into a large and complex family drama into the lives of two German brothers  both born close upon the turn of the century both so caught up in the currents of history that their story is one with the story of their country from the Kaisers heyday through Hitlers rise and fall A novel that rings powerfully true a rich and remarkable portrait of Germany in the first half of the twentieth centuryIn his portrait of a Berlin family during the turbulent years of the first half of the century Len Deighton has created a compelling study of the rise of Nazi GermanyWith its meticulous research rich detail and brilliantly drawn cast of characters Winter is a superbly realized achievement I really enjoyed this book Ive seen other reviews that say this book is about a family living through World War II and to say that really short changes this magnificent novel Its the story of a family from  to  as the title says It focuses on the lives of two brothers the youngest is born on New Years Day of  Through this family we witness the rise of Germany as a world power its defeat in WWI the recovery of the country and the rise to power of the Nazis afterward to the eventual downfall of the regime and the ultimate ruin of the country Its one of those novels that leaves you a little down when you finish because you dont want it to end   If you dont like this then you dont like historical fiction This book is a prequel to the extensive trio of trilogies Len Deighton wrote starting with Mexico Game going through Hook and then Faith The latter trilogies are cold war spy thrillers that are complicated is that spy a double or a triple agent while Winter is more classic historical fiction which provides the background for the characters in the cold war trilogies Winter tracks the postWWI German family establishes the forces that bear upon them and then watches the characters politics and fates evolve Excellent   One of the BEST books Ive EVER read I was impressed with how youre drawn into Germanys history from the turn of the century thru WWI up until the end of WWII He not only TELLS you about dates and situations but makes you feel like youre RIGHT THERE in the MIDDLE of it allHe knows how to bring history to life in a way that books and documentaries cant trust me Ive read and seen a lot of them by involving you in the lives of two brothers who are struggling to decide who they are GO GET IT NOW   This is one of the best books Ive ever read Im shatteredWhy do I like it so much Hmm where to begin The historical scope The sheer breadth of it is staggering The book encompasses the time from the beginning of the th century and up until  just after the end of World War II so it spans over nearly half a century It tells Germanys history of that period through the lives of one family the Winters We experience the early s buzzing with excitement over bold new inventions and miraculous flying machines with all the luxuries and the newly emerging art and the servants and the extravagant balls We are then thrown in the midst of bloody fleainfested brutal stinking trench war that changes everything and everyone lucky enough to emerge from it alive We see the dark years that follow with the hunger and the plundering and the gangs of exsoldiers crisscrossing the country The hurt German pride the sense of injustice the hatred towards the victorious powers and the desire to show them how great Germany really is the secret rearmament and preparation for war We begin to understand how and why the Nazi party emerged and we see the ensuing nightmare unfold little by little from several different angles The months immediately after the end of WW in Berlin are especially haunting The characters They are alive realistically portrayed people of different backgrounds each one with his or her own stark individuality We see them develop from small children through youngsters into adults and sometimes into their old age changing and evolving all the time They are all shaped by their surroundings and they respond differently and very convincingly to the overarching historical events We know some of the names from the Bernard Samson series and that makes reading Winter even more interesting Those are the predecessors or sometimes the young versions of the characters we see later in Berlin and London The story It is terribly exciting The complex relationships and the realistic interactions between the characters make this book an irresistible pageturner An absolute masterpiece   Originally published on my blog here in July After the phenomenal success of the first trilogy of Bernard Samson novels Deighton wrote Winter as a sort of prequel Sort of because it doesnt actually involve many of the characters from the trilogy  being mainly about their parents and grand parents during the first half of the twentieth century  and has a very different focus  it is really about the rise of Hitler This is Deightons attempt to explain just why so many Germans came to support the NazisThe plot is more a family saga than a thriller two brothers who grow up close but are divided later when one is caught up by the Nazi bandwagon while the other marries a Jew and plays the piano for Brecht and Weill While Deighton really has nothing new to say about the early days of National Socialism which must be one of the most closely studied parts of twentieth century political history the story of the Winter brothers illuminates the history and makes it personal they are exactly the sort of well drawn well placed fictional characters which are a part of many good historical novels And that is really what Winter is  an excellent historical novel not a thriller Its closest companion in Deightons work is the alternative history SSGB but it is also like his Second World War novels Bomber and Goodbye Mickey Mouse in that its purpose is to put well realised imaginary characters in immaculately researched historical settings Of all these four novels Winter is the most successful the Winter brothers being two of the best written characters in all of Deightons output Winter is by a large margin Deightons longest novel but it is definitely worth the read   "},

sometimes savage but for the main beautiful and haunting The Daily Telegraph writes Brilliantly absorbingRichly evocative and full of compelling twists and turns Recommended Reading for Historical Fiction lovers but also those readers who just plain enjoy a good story  Content in Italics preceding  is cribbed from Reading Group Notes In Brief at back of book   Thank goodness its over Lonie has to be one of the most irritating female characters Ive read in a while she wants to be considered an adult being a yearold girl in France in  and yet consistently behaves like a child When she is caught and rightly chided she throws a tantrum worthy of a toddler Every time up until the last  or so pages only a chapter is devoted to her actual emotion growthwhich would have made a far more interesting story Even Lonies aunt Isodel had promise as a character up until those last few pagesbut unfortunately not being main focus character Lonie Isodel is denied any character growth until the end she is weak weepy and lost without her manslight view spoiler Even the baby is too charming to be real Considering the circumstances couldnt he be possibly be at least a little trouble  Meredith may be less irritating if only because she is an adult less her Tragic Backstory but it wasnt too bad considering Her introduction to Lonies story stretches the imaginationthere was no reason for her not to have her own twist in her story instead of the Debussy memoir If your character is supposedly researching a significant real historical figure either shed better let me know more about him or discover something important even if not real during the course of the story Instead Merediths memoir research is her reason for being in France and is given a shout out at the end She does grant it a few thoughts while she wanders merrily on her own adventures but I would like to know how she managed the rest of her research during her tripThe character description of both characters at times crossed into the terribly awkward twice Lonies hair is described as paraphrased falling down her back like a skein of silk to her slender waist and Meredith gets a she stretched her long slender arms above her head Neither is too terribly bad but generally the text is fairly close rd person which makes it sound like Lonie and Meredith have rather generous descriptions of themselves Of course this may well be my own insecurity but since theyve both had and are continually given perfectly serviceable and nonintrusive descriptions saying the same thing before its unnecessary purple proseSpeaking of purple prose theres a lot of it Mosse wants to place the reader in France either in the late th century or modern day and she spends a lot of words attempting too Unfortunately it reads more like a laundry list or a description of a post card and buries whatever atmosphere or authenticity the setting could have grantedAnd frankly I really dont care about the clothes Patricia Clapp in JaneEmily had a few descriptions of clothes for her teenage narrator but used them to indicate character growth Here its just fillerSepulchres plot seems to be based on a similar conspiracy theory to The Da Vinci Code I think admittedly Im more than a little shaky on my French history but since I just read Secret Societies the names seemed familiar The tarot angle quite frankly never seemed to go anywhere but perhaps its just because this book took me so long to read Lonie especially became so irritating after just a few chapters Id have to set it down for minuteshoursa monthOh and if you enjoy clever engaging convincing threating villains look somewhere else Quite frankly the foreshadowing in this novel especially later devolves into Thats an odd thing It makes me think of  But that couldnt possibly be the case Nope no way Couldnt possibly Because I said so Saying that most of the rest wasnt too bad But maybe trying to keep up suspense a great many chapters ended on this note Last but not at all least the villains are given their own point of view chapters which is frankly one of the worst decisions in this book This isnt a spoiler because as soon as we get their pov the villains announce their villainy And in case you dont believe them go out of their way to make their evil plans by rubbing their hands and cackling madly and commenting on the beauty of the protagonists Both were despicable characters not frightening antagonists As a final note however th century rich people though of their servants its something of a turnoff when your narrator genuinely thinks of the commoners as being lesser Every time she ended outside her house and family and encountered real people Lonie seemed incapable as seeing them as anything but threatening And honestly even if she did know more it wouldnt have helped her Shes not a critical thinker of anything The closest she can come to identifying with someone from a lower class than herself is with her Most Loyal Servants And regarding the end If anyone else can tell me that the very end does anything more than confirm her attitude as right please let me know Because I was seeing redAnd thank goodness I only paid  for the hardcover at BigLots brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   Eh Ive read worse But Ive also read much betterDespite some intriguing motifs  settings this book is bloated with extraneous detail  hampered by flat characters Even the most dramatic moments never manage to engage the reader beyond a momentary blip of acceptance Example Oops that crazy dude is dead Wait what Youre saying some tarot cards  a vaguelydescribed devil killed him Oh well Somewhere in this book is a decent gothic novel  but its trying way too hard People behave stupidly for no reason other than to serve a flat predictable plotline  neither the story nor its inhabitants manage to compensate for the otherThe timeslip descendent stuff in particular was a waste of space SEPULCHRE couldve been half the length  twice as interesting without the meandering travelogue descriptions  boringashell contemporary sections Example pg Thirty minutes later feeling more like herself she wrapped herself in a huge white bathrobe plugged in her cell to recharge and sat down at her laptop Discovering she couldnt get Internet access she reached over and dialed receptionYAWN This Yeah this is NOT a substitute for character development Rather this is on the extreme end of Unimportant Information Not every tangent in SEPULCHRE is so utterly useless to the plot but cmon This breed of meandering playbyplay is the kind of thing youd expect in secondrate fanfic not a professional manuscript For shame editors For shame stars In this case Ill go with the Goodreads caption ie it was okay   ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureKate Mosses Sepulchre is a historical fantasy  historical fiction with fantastic elements I enjoy both genres and this novel features a female graduate student somebody I can relate to as one of the main characters and its available on audiobook so I thought it would be good entertainment on my commute I got about ten chapters in before quittingThe book seems wellresearched is competently written the tone switches easily and successfully from past to present and back and the characters are interesting enough Here is the problem It is full of enormous amounts of tedious descriptions of ancient and current French landmarks French historical events French historical figures and untranslated French dialogue I realize of course that France is the setting of this historical novel but the effect of all of this namedropping is to make me think that Ms Mosse feels the need to prove she did her research  shes trying too hard and it comes off as pretentious And obnoxious Especially when Im listening to it in audio format and I cant just skim over the French words Here are some examples some are from later in the bookIt was not quite dawn yet Paris was waking In the distance Anatole could hear the sounds of delivery carts Wooden traps over the cobbles delivering milk and freshly baked bread to the cafes and bars of the Faubourg Montmartre He stopped to put on his shoes The rue Feydeau was deserted there was no sound except the clip of his heels on the pavement Deep in thought Anatole walked quickly to the junction with the rue SaintMarc intending to cut through the arcade of the Passage des Panoramas He saw no one heard no oneBy the time a smoggy and hesitant dawn broke over the offices of the Commissariat of Police of the eighth arrondissement in the rue de Lisbonne tempers were already frayed The body of a woman identified as Madame Marguerite Vernier has been discovered shortly after eight oclock on the evening of Sunday September  The news had been telephoned in from one of the new public booths on the corner of the rue de Berlin and the rue dAmsterdam by a reporter from Le Petit JournalIn the next stack she discovered a first edition of Maistres Voyage autour de ma chambre It was battered and dogeared unlike Anatoles pristine copy at home In another alcove she found a collection of both religious and fervently antireligious texts grouped together as if to cancel one another out In the section devoted to contemporary French literature there was a set of Zolas RougonMacquart novels as well as Flaubert Maupassant and Huysmans indeed many of the intellectually improving texts Anatole tried in vain to press upon her even a first edition of Stendhals Le rouge et le noir There were a few works in translation but nothing entirely to her taste except for Baudelaires translations of Monsieur Poe Nothing by Madame Radcliffe or Monsieur Le Fanu    The first was Dogme et rituel de la haute magie by liphaas Lvi Next to it was a volume titled Trait mthodique de science occulte On the shelf above several other writings by Papus Court de Gbelin Etteilla and MacGregor Mathers She had never read such authors but knew they were occultist writers and considered subversive Their names appeared regularly in the columns of newspapers and periodicalsAt first I found myself rolling my eyes at every French phrase and namedrop but since that started to become a driving hazard I just quit listening I would much rather read a story whose purpose is to entertain me not to enlighten or impress me Sadly Sepulchre did none of these thingsRead this review in context at   There might have been a good story in this book but it was overshadowed by flat and silly characters As someone else has pointed out so many of the events in this book are completely avoidable and the characters just act stupidly in order to carry out the plotThe book centers on a brother Anatole and sister Leonie who go to live with their Aunt Isolde Isolde and Anatole are actually secret lovers hiding from her malicious former lover Although Anatole knows he is being stalked by the former lover Victor he never reveals this to the two woman in his life Eventually the violent Victor catches up with the lovers but again this information is hidden from the sister The ultimate showdown between Leonie and her brothers rival is ridiculous Within one pargraph she agrees it is time to leave her aunts home and then holds steady in her decision to stay She knows Victor will attempt to attack her on Halloween and plans to leave to avoid the confrontation but then does not there is no explanation why she has not left She receives a request to visit with the local priest on Halloween Although clearly suspicious she leaves to visit the priest but is surprised when he is not there to greet her Shocked that this has been a ploy to drive her awayThere are story lines that go absolutely nowhere and seem to have nothing to do with the story This is a fairly long book with a lot of exposition and very little to draw it all together The secondary modern story line is tedious and boringI noticed that the book is listed as the second in a  part series and maybe the missing background on some of the story lines are embedded in these other books but this book is far too long to not be able to stand on its own   "},

chair of nails and a gorefilled video game stuck in my head The romance is light but sweet The characters have depth and are interesting The dialogue was not there as much as I would like  Im a dialogue girl  but it was realistic and followed the storyline The author clearly did her research and this showed in her descriptions of medical examinations detective work forensics etc No bumbling Barney Fifes in this book Im thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend this series to anyone with a strong stomach    Quick SummaryIt all started to unravel when a man stumbles upon a killers graveyard only because his wife thought he needed exercise By the time Sophie Johannsen a local archeologist finished her analysis the body count was outrageous Detective Vito Ciccotelli Chick had his hands full and not just with solving the case The mysterysuspenseUtterly chilling This was one of the most twisted serial killers ever Woke up at  am because I just had to make sure they got him before he offed someone I cared about The romanceVito and Sophie were zapped the first moment they met and really didnt try to avoid it Aside from a few bumps this was a fine and sexy romance And speaking of the main charactersSophie is a  blonde beautiful Amazon with a big brain and snarky wit Vito is tall dark and a little broody but with a sense of romance that had her and me melt Oh and he has a dimple in one cheek And everyone elseIts a big cast and Sophie and Vito are just two of the very welldeveloped characters in this story What about the rest of the seriesIm  books in and its a perfect record These are the most consistent stories in all the series on my shelf If you havent read Karen Rose and you love this genre youre really missing something special Just make sure you start from the beginning Bottom lineAnother chilling mystery great romance and interesting story This author is my autobuy    Die For Me has received almost unanimous  star reviews from everyone whose read it that I know personally Im gonna have to add mine to it Well written extremely well plotted without sacrificing one ounce of character development Ms Rose is an author to watchShe must be considering the fact Im almost fed up with the serial killerstalker plot In fact I almost put DFM down soon after I started it because of this but the intriguing characters and my curiosity about them kept me goingSophie is an archaeologist called into to assist the police in a homicide investigation when a body is found on a deserted piece of property Shes tall prone to hippy clothing bold and blond and just as vulnerable as you and I Vito is a detective with soft heart Hes seen the worst including an event that killed the woman he loved but he hasnt given up on humanity When they meet there is an instant attraction and despite all thats going on around them and their respective baggage they fall for each other in a big wayThe killer in this story is unconscionable heartless and not as intelligent as he thinks Too late he finds himself up against a formidable investigative team a team who cracks the shell of his evil deeds putting themselves one step ahead of unknowing him through most of the book Which is something that I LOVED about DFM These cops were no dummiesThis book is a nailbiter and the inevitable climax and resolution is satisfying enough to suit even lil ol jaded me Sophie aint no wilting flower waiting patiently for her knight in shining armor although Vito is indeed thatGood read    Die For Me was another winner by Karen Rose This book was filled with suspense and had a touching romance as well The hero and heroine both have unresolved issues from their pasts that they help each other confront They are both very likeable characters and I appreciated the way that they did not fight their feelings for one another The villain was truly evil and the descriptions of his handiwork were quite gruesome As with the other Karen Rose books I have read this was an intense engrossing book I am already looking forward to reading the next book Scream for MeVito Ciccotelli Philadelphia Homicide Detective is called to investigate a body found in a field When the body is uncovered what they find is horrifying A metal detector indicates the possibility of finding more of this gruesome handiwork The police department requests the assistance of an archaeologist Sophie Johannsen Her sophisticated equipment scans reveal a grid of bodies in the field As the bodies are exhumed it is clear that they are dealing with a monster Several of the bodies have been brutalized using medieval torture methods After spending hours scanning the field Vito assits Sophie in putting her borrowed equipment away and asks her to dinner The two are immediately drawn to one another but an incident occurs that causes Sophie to badly misjudge and rebuff Vito Vito contacts Sophie the next day to try to find out why she so suddenly seemed to dislike him Their misunderstanding is cleared and they share a kiss but Sophie still refuses his company As Sophie is an expert in medieval warfare she continues to consult with the police She believes that information Vito will hear from one of the medieval experts she sends him to will turn him against her Nothing is further from the truth and when Vito lets Sophie know that he trusts her and believes in her integrity she agrees to dinner Vito and Sophie spend a passionate night together and when he realizes that other medieval experts are disappearing he makes certain she is provided with police department protection Vito spends his nights with Sophie and they quickly become to care deeply for one another As they investigate the murders they find numerous people to question and they soon realize that this brutal killer is using the murders as artwork for a video game The investigation becomes more personal to Vito when it becomes clear that Sophie is a target of the murderer While Vito and Sophie learn more about one another and realize how important their relationship is danger to Sophie escalates and they must race to apprehend the terrifying killerThere was much to like about this book It had a great story filled with suspense and wonderful main characters whose romance is satisfying There were numerous likeable secondary characters and a terrifyingly evil antagonist I did make a mistake right before I read this book that lessened the suspense I went to Karen Roses website to review the book relationship page with all of the major characters listed and then decided to read the synopsis of the next book Scream for Me The first sentence of the synopsis for that book told me the identity of the bad guy in Die for Me I immediately quit reading the synopsis and I still thoroughly enjoyed the book but I wish I would not have known who the villain actually was I would have liked to see how long it took me to discover it myself If you dont want a huge spoiler for this great book stay away from the synopsis for the next book    Very well narrated by Tavia Gilbert Ill look for books narrated by her again A fabulous crimemystery that still manages to have a great romance within amazing secondary characters pleasant epilogue Be warned the serial killer is    diabolically evil   "},

"author": "Joseph Heller",
"text": "At the heart of Catch resides the incomparable malingering bombardier Yossarian a hero endlessly inventive in his schemes to save his skin from the horrible chances of warHis problem is Colonel Cathcart who keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service Yet if Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions that hes committed to flying hes trapped by the Great Loyalty Oath Crusade the bureaucratic rule from which the book takes its title a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions the very act of making the request proves that hes sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved I have attempted to read this book on two separate occasions and I couldnt get beyond  pages either time I do believe that this has more to do with me than the book and I plan on making a third attempt at some point in the future Currently it sits on my bookshelf and sometimes when I have a few too many beers we have a talkMe HiCatch Oh hiMe How are you feelingCatch Ive been betterMe Dont be upset Its not you Its meCatch I know thatMe My friends tell me Im an idiot for ending our relationshipCatch I agreeMe Im sure the reason I dont laugh or enjoy myself when Im with you has more to do with my own flaws than

enlightened enough to appreciate you and when that day comes you and I will have some fun togetherCatch I wont hold my breath      A shiny new batch of awesome for my all time favorite shelf It has been awhile since Ive so throughly enjoyed reading a novel that has at the same time left me as intellectually awestruck as Joseph Hellers classic sermon on the insanity of war What a sublime literary feast To prepare Start with a surrealistic Kafkaesque worldview basted in chaos Knead in a plot reminiscent of Pynchon taking particular care that the bizarre placidly disjointed surface fully camouflages the powerfully nuanced and deceptively focused central message  Marinate the whole thing in a dark hilarious satire that would have made Vonnegut beam like a proud papa  Bake at  season with zesty prose and serve Voilaa singular absurdilarious serving of inspired genius that I can not recommend more highly This novel was so much more than I was expecting Despite its pervasive laugh out loud humor Hellers story is the most horrifyingly effective depiction of the insanity of war that Ive ever read Im not referring to the evil and vile atrocities perpetrated in war that have been so extensively catalogued throughout the annals of literature Rather Hellers insight is geared to showing us the illogic of war the outofcontrol nihilism and the chaotic existential absurdity of it Its brilliant I think any attempt at a plot summary is doomed to inadequacy so let me just briefly frame the story The novel follows the exploits of the fictional th fighter squadron stationed on the fictional island of Pianosa during the height of WWII With a large cast of characters and a nonchronological narrative that switches viewpoints constantly Heller creates a delicious cauldron of madness and bureaucratic ineptitude that is just heaven to follow Our chief tour guide through the nuthouse is Captain John Yossarian bomber pilot whose main ambition in life is to live forever or die in the attempt Yossarians life wish is so strong that he doesnt even distinguish between the enemy and his superiors As far as hes concerned the enemy is anybody whos going to get you killed no matter which side hes on To avoid the final finality of death Yossarian concocts a series of ingenious and hysterical methods for staying alive including poisoning his own squadron and redrawing a the combat map during the Great Big Siege of Bologna so as to alter the bombing target Despite his often less than moral shenanigans Yossarian acts as the conscience of the story and helps to keep the rampant lunacy and chaos in context His is the voice of indignity and righteous anger against the war and the cold faceless bureaucracy that perpetrates it Even against the God that allows it such horrors to exist in the first place   Loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved it loved itand loved it The writing is brilliant the characters are unique engaging and memorable and the story will scar you with wonder and awe I cant believe I hesitated so long to read this and I intend to sit down with this many times in the years to come For those that have experienced this before and for those who just want a stroll down memory lane here are a few pearls that showcase this novels rather large package of absurd satircal win Fortunately just when things were blackest the war broke outIll tell you what justice is Justice is a knee in the gut from the floor on the chin at night sneaky with a knife brought up down on the magazine of a battleship sandbagged underhanded in the dark without a word of warningColonel Cargill could be relied on to run the most prosperous enterprise into the ground He was a selfmade man who owed his lack of success to nobodyColonel Cathcart was indefatigable that way an industrious intense dedicated military tactician who calculated day and night in the service of himselfAnd a personal favorite all leading up to the very last line   Finally I wanted to share one last piece of awesome with you The following is the contents of the letter sent by the base commander to the wife of one of the main characters    Pricelessand whats even funnier is that the set up of the joke occurs about  pages before Masterful  stars HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION   I suffered through about  pages and finally put it down I very rarely ever leave a book unfinished The author narrates and introduces us to Yossarian who does not want to fly in the war I get that I get the whole catch  scenerio You have to be insane to fly the plane If you can get a dr to say you are insane you wont have to fly But in order to tell a dr that you are insane this actually means you are sane So you must continue to fly which makes you insane blah blah blahWhat I couldnt get past was the authors constant bouts of Attention Deficet Disorder He went off on tangents introducing a new character seemingly every paragraph and seemed to lose his train of thought only to regain it  pages later I couldnt take all the jumping around and was completely lost the whole time at times rereading the prior page thinking I missed some important tiein somewhereAm I the only one on this planet who is asking myself what heck everyone was smoking when they read this book and actually enjoyed it   The following is an example of how many conversations in this book took placeJen I didnt like this bookNigel Why didnt you like the bookJen I did like the bookNigel You just said you didnt like the bookJen No I didntNigel Youre lyingJen I dont believe in lyingNigel So you never lieJen Oh yes I lie all the timeNigel You just said you dont believe in itJen I dont believe in it Jen said as she ate a chocolate covered cotton ballNigel Well I liked the bookJen Fabulous I liked it tooNigel What did you like about itJen Oh I hated itI think Heller was showing how war is chaotic by not writing in a chronological order You really have no idea in what order events are taking place I think he was showing how war is ridiculous by writing conversations like the one above Im not sure if any of his goals were to annoy the living hell out of his readers but he annoyed me  pages of absurdness is too much for me Most of the characters were very onedimensional I could only distinguish between people by their names Most of the good guys all had the same personalities and the bad guys all had the same personalities except one character ate peanut brittle and another put crab apples in his cheeks Other than that  same personalities Maybe his goal was only to distinguish between the good everyday guys and the evil powerhungry men in charge If so he succeeded I just wasnt thrilled after page  or so There is some funny stuff in there The chocolatecovered cotton balls will crack me up for life Theres some really sad stuff too Its weird because every time someone died I cared even though I knew nothing about them except what they ate or who their favorite whore was Im not sure how Heller pulled that off Anyway I would recommend it Its just that the ridiculousness of it gets to the point where its just well ridiculous and beyond my personal tolerance level I still appreciated it though   You mean theres a catch  Originally Catch was Catch but because Leon Uris was publishing a novel called Mila that same year Joseph Hellers agent decided the title needed to be changed so as to not confuse the book buying public Also given that  is a double  they liked the way it represented the many dj vu moments that occur in the book The East Coast publishing intelligentsia really embraced the book even though there were doubts if it would ever gain traction with the American public It didI understand the frustration that publishers feel with the American book buying public They have all been scorched by a book they felt should have sold by the wheelbarrow only to have it crash and burn with the majority of the first printing sold off to a remainder company Sometimes a book needs a lightning strike in the form of Oprah or a school banning the book thankyou Strongsville OH but for Heller all he needed was the s The book is set during WWII the last good war according to everyone from Tom Brokaw to the school janitor at Phillipsburg High School Fat novels glorifying the war some extraordinarily good were hitting bookstores at a fast clip from the late s on By the time Catch came out in  the world had changed So those people who bought this book who thought they were in for another werent we great novel about World War Two were in for a shock A typical reaction wasWTFSome thought it was irreverent but there were a growing group of people who thought it was among the best American novels they had ever read Both reactions helped juice the novel and sales began to climb   Joseph Heller in uniformAt the tender age of  in  Joseph Heller joined the US Army Air Corp By  he found himself on the Italian Front as a B Bombardier He flew  missions most of which he categorized as milk runs these were flight missions that encounter no or very little antiaircraft artillery or enemy fighters Heller admits that his disillusionment with the war in Korea colored the novel It gives me the shakes to think how different the novel would be if he had published the book in  instead of  Little did he know how prophetic his novel would be regarding the Vietnam War Yossarian has reached the end of his rope He has flown the required number of combat missions several times but each time Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions required to go home A similar circumstance plagued Hawkeye Pierce and his fellow doctors in the Korean War based TV series MASH The pressure of thousands of people he doesnt even know and hundreds he does know trying to kill him is just too much for him to bear As he becomes more and more insanesane he becomes more and more qualified to fly combat missions as far as the military is concerned He comes up with various ailments to keep him in the hospital He shows up to receive his war medal naked except for a pair of moccasins He finally refuses to fly any more missions and begins parading around the camp walking backwards This does start to foment rebellion among his fellow flyers and drives Colonel Cathcart to distraction Morale was deteriorating and it was all Yossarians fault The country was in peril he was jeopardizing his traditional rights of freedom and independence by daring to exercise themHeller surrounds Yossarian with a wonderful cast of detailed characters of which I will only be able to mention a few Lieutenant Nately is one of Yossarians best friends a trust fund baby with red white and blue blood running through his veins He is a good looking kid and could have any woman he wanted but he falls in love with an Italian prostitute who begrudgingly sleeps with him when he pays for sex with her but would rather he just disappeared He has this great discussion with her  year old pimp Italy is one of the least prosperous nations on earth And the Italian fighting man is probably second to all And thats exactly why my country is doing so well in this war while your country is doing so poorlyNately continues to be the straight man for the old man as they discuss the absurdity of risking ones life for their countryThere is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country he Nately declaredMilo Minderbinder is in charge of the mess at the US Army Corps base As he learns more and more about how goods are moved around the globe he begins a business of supply and demand war profiteering He becomes the ultimate capitalist with no allegiance to any country He trades with the enemy and as part of contract negotiations he also warns the Germans once of an impending attack even to the point of guiding antiartillery against American planes and in another case bombs his own base to fulfill another contract The absurdity of his position is that he is too important to the American high command to get in trouble for any of these acts of treason He tries to explain one of his more successful schemes to Yossarian I dont understand why you buy eggs for seven cents apiece in Malta and sell them for five centsHungry Joe keeps meeting the flight standards time and time again only to have his paperwork take too long to process before the flight standards have been raised again He packs and then he unpacks He is a fat pervert who convinces women to take their clothes off to be photographed by telling them that he works for Life Magazine and will put them on the cover Unfortunately the photographs never turn out Ironically he did work as a photographer for Life Magazine before the war Women do play a role in this book mostly as objects of lust Heller has these wonderful creative descriptions of them She would have been perfect for Yossarian a debauched coarse vulgar amoral appetizing slattern whom he had longed for and idolized for months She was a real find She paid for her own drinks and she had an automobile an apartment and a salmoncolored cameo ring that drove Hungry Joe clean out of his senses with its exquisitely carved figures of a naked boy and girl on a rockAnd then there is a nurse that brings Yossarian nearly to his knees with desire Yossarian was sick with lust and mesmerized with regret General Dreedles nurse was only a little chubby and his senses were stuffed to congestion with the yellow radiance of her hair and the unfelt pressure of her soft short fingers with the rounded untasted wealth of her nubile breast in her Armypink shirt that was opened wide at the the throat and with the rolling ripened triangular confluences of her belly and thighs in her tight slick forestgreen garbardine officers pants He drank her in insatiably from head to painted toenail He never wanted to lose her Ooooooooooooh he moaned again and this time the whole room rippled at his quavering drownout cryYou will probably need to google the next one He enjoyed Nurse Sue Ann Drucketts long white legs and supple callipygous assParadoxes abound even when Heller describes a character he will have countering characteristics like she was plain but pretty or he was handsome but ugly Arent we all a sum of those characteristics anyway  Joseph Heller looking handsome and uglyThis book is hilarious I laughed out loud at several pointsbut wrapped with increasingly more tragic circumstances As Yossarians friends die or disappear his desperation increases His behavior becomes more and more erratic The absurd traps him time and time again There are a whole host of reasons why everyone should read this novel Im not saying that everyone will like it as much as I did but it is IMHO one of the top five most important American novels ever written It impacted our culture added words to our language and gave voice to a generation of people dissatisfied with the war aims of this country More importantly dont be the one person in the middle of a Catch discussion who hasnt read the book If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews visit

"author": "Jack Higgins",
"text": "A death in Brooklyn sends reverberations around the world in Jack Higginss thrilling new adventureHigginss novels of honor bravery and irresistible intrigue delight millions of readers every year but few of his books pack the sheer narrative power of Day of ReckoningJournalist Katherine Johnson made the mistake of getting too close to the secrets of international crime boss Jack Fox  but Fox made the mistake of killing her Katherines exhusband is Blake Johnson head of the clandestine White House department known as The Basement and with the Presidents permission the former FBI agent is about to take revenge Wherever the money trail leads  New York England Ireland the Middle East  Johnson and his Irish colleague Sean Dillon plan to hit Fox where it hurts the most by cutting his illegal businesses to shreds until Fox stands defenseless before his enemiesBut Fox did not become powerful by letting his enemies get that close If Johnson and Dillon want to take him on they will have to face his own brand of revenge And it is a revenge every bit as deadly as their ownDay of Reckoning is brilliant suspense  the master working truly at the height of his powers  Imagine a mob family having IRA connections and gang affiliations in England to create a multinational enterprise comprising both legal and illegal operations This is the Cosa Nostra and its headed by the Solazzo family In an attempt to keep their underthetable dealings secret the family has a journalist murdered It is her death that begins this three hundred page tale of revenge by her exhusband exFBI agent who has friends in high enough places to bring down the family by bankrupting Cosa Nostra and killing those who participated in his exwifes death There is a lot of potential to this story but it bogs down with the sheer number of characters all taking advantage of the situation to play out their own long dreamed of plans of revenge There are some interesting pieces like the way in which they close the casino but there arent enough of these scenes to keep the story going   This is a short uninspired novel that feels like it was rushed out in order to fulfill a book contract or something Either that or Higgins is running out of ideas Day of Reckoning is entertaining enough to be a passable read but theres hardly a description or moment of subtle characterization anywhere to be found throughout Nearly every sentence in the book is either action or dialog so the plot progresses at a dizzying streamlined pace A great number of characters sometimes with similar names pop in and out and its hard to keep track of who everybody is The plot is extremely derivative of countless actionheist movies and Higgins seemingly tries to make up for it by trotting out as many popular characters from his previous books as he can manage Still the result is not entirely disagreeable But definitely disappointing    This is a pretty good story line but there isnt a lot of character development or downtime between action scenes to make you have any feeling for the people in the book Instead its just a narrative of all the events as they happen and you do want the bad guy to buy the farm as they say but if Higgins had just taken the time to let you get to know the characters a bit better instead of rushing to the next action scene I think there was a potential for a very good book instead of just an average one   Day of Reckoning is a book written by the British author Jack Higgins and author who has written some bestselling books This is Higgins twentysixth novel and the eighth novel in the Sean Dillon series According to the publisher this book is supposedly a thriller but Id categorise this under the genre  action It would appeal to people who like action movies This book features Sean Dillon an exIRA person who disliked killing innocent people in Ulster and hence left IRA and decided to be a mercenary who sold his services to various organisations legal or illegal he didnt care In his life of crime he was caught only once at Bosnia by the Serbs and was sentenced to death Brigadier Charles Ferguson who was directly under the British Prime Minister decided to take him out of prison and in turn Sean Dillon had to work for him Sean Dillon says that he is a good actor and is also a good scuba diver He is a person who doesnt care whether he lives or dies and hence is an ideal mercenary The other main charactersprotagonists in this book are Blake Johnson Charles Ferguson Hannah Bernstein and Billy Salter and the only antagonist is Jack Fox along with his aides Charles Ferguson is a Brigadier and he mainly wants to get his things done He doesnt mind if his approach is unethical for example he doesnt mind hiring gangsters to take out gangsters Hannah Bernstein is a Chief Superintendent in Scotland yard and she on the other hand gives respect to morals and values She hesitates to do anything which is against the law and because of Sean Dillons past she is never willing t apologise him Blake Johnson is an American a friend of Dillon and Ferguson is in charge of the Presidents personal force and is a close friend of the president and from what I could understand for him revenge is the priority Billy Salter is petty criminal nephew of an old fashioned criminal who runs a pub in London Dillon hires him for his scuba diving abilities Jack Fox the main antagonist is the frontman of the Solazzo family a notorious mafia gang He has a lot of illegal businesses and anyone who gets too close to him is killedComing to the plot it starts when Blake Johnsons exwife Kate Johnson is killed by Jack Foxs mafia gang for investigating into the businesses of the Solazzo family Blake Johnson who comes to know of this wants revenge He gets the details about the businesses of the Solazzo family from the tapes that she had recorded and he didnt want to take revenge by killing him directly He wanted to ruin him by destroying every business of his this was Dillons idea and making him run out of cash and thereby because of his failures the old don of the Solazzo family Don Marco Solazzo would take Fox out of the business Most of the story takes place in London but to destroy the mafias businesses the story also goes to Manhattan Ireland Cornwall and Lebanon So to describe the plot in one line Fox attacks Johnson and friends plan the counterattack The language of the author was good although in one place he had written She was always chronically short of money When you say chronic you need not even supply the adjective always But for that the language was very good I also believe if youre not sure of something it is better not to use it The research work was good in most cases but what Im particularly referring to here is in this book there is a surgeon named Daz who is supposed to be an Indian but Ive never heard of such a surname The first name was never mentioned so I assumed that he was an Indian Christian but he also mentions that he is a Hindu Ive never heard of the Indian Hindu surname Daz One thing to be appreciated is the author didnt digress from the main aim of the story But if you ask me the Publishers writeup is misleading Foxs own brand of revenge  Yes Fox did start very strongly but as the story went on he nearly became a forgotten character and made a cameo appearance in the end This book is not very boring but there is nothing special in this It may qualify for a Hollywood action movie and spending one and a half hours is not a problem but reading three  pages for such a book is certainly not worth it It is as simple as this Good fellows take out the bad fellows The appropriate age group for this book in my opinion is  I would not suggest anyone to buy this book but I feel it can be read once by borrowing it from a library or a friend   The starting point is a bit different from the other Dillon novels it is not about Sean trying to save the world from a bad guy but rather helping his Yankee friend Blake Johnson to avenge the death of his exwife killed by the mafia because she knew too much So everything turns down to the elimination of the Sollazzo family For once I agree with Hannah Bernstein that private justice is not the way to go especially since it turns a nice person as Blake into a killer and Dillon and Ferguson into means to an end The only thing I truly liked are the supporting characters the Salters are great and Roper the IT genius is a really good add to the team All things considered is not a bad novel just not as good as the others    "},

"text": "In the early days of World War II nations were forced to choose sides in the epic battle that would change history forever But for two brothers fate had already made the choice Separated as boys Max and Harry Kelso have grown up to become ace fighter pilots  Max with the German Luftwaffe and Harry in Britains RAF Now the machinery of war has set in motion an intrigue so devious so filled with peril that it will require them to question everything they know everything they hold most dear their lives their families their loyalties Against impossible odds it is their courage alone that will decide the course of the war  This is a weak offering from an author who can do a lot betterIt is quite an old novel subject to a reissue and is the tale of two fighter aces twin brothers who fight for the RAF and the Luftwaffe By way of a backstory we see the separate stories of the two brothers knowing that eventually their paths will collideSurprisingly for Higgins it is simplistic and lacks any sort of tension Not helped by a total lack of character for the two twins they remain fairly blank canvases right to the end Sadly the dialogue is somewhat stilted too A twist is introduced towards the end which is one of the least interesting ones I have ever read  Utterly pointlessHaving said it is a very easy if frustrating book to read but you finish up thinking your time would have been better spent on a better book Probably best avoided   While the novel was centered around an interesting premise of  brothers both fighter pilots fighting on opposite sides in the Second World War I felt as if it was a rush job The characters were sketchily drawn and showed little depth The one figure I found most appalling was an SS officer named Erich Hartmann which was also the name of the top Luftwaffe fighter ace who by all accounts was a very principled man having survived  years of Soviet imprisonment between  and  who came across as the perfect cardboard sadistic villain from central casting as only Hollywood could create Frankly this novel disgusted me I had been a thoroughgoing Jack Higgins fan for years Now I am no longer a fan preferring only to confine myself to his earlier novels like THE EAGLE HAS LANDED and STORM WARNING    This Flight of the Eagles follows a similar theme of the previous novels written by Jack Higgins such as The Eagle has Landed which sold over  million copies The novel takes place during World War  and is about two brothers both fliers who fight on different sides It is an easy novel to read and follow and I found it very entertaining There are some twists and turns and I looked forward to reading the book and once started found it difficult to put down i read some of the other reviews and cannot agree with the negative reviews If you want to relax and read an entertaining story this is for you I am a big fan of Jack Higgins and always enjoyed his novels Jack Higgins penned many novels under the names of James Graham Martin Fallon and Hugh Marlowe Patterson began using the pseudonym Jack Higgins in the late s Some readers feel all his novels should be of the quality of the Eagle has Landed but how many home runs can you hit The Eagle Has Landed was written in  and defined the war novels of the s This novel made Higgins reputation The novel represented a step forward in the length and depth of Pattersons work and sold  million copies and was made into a hit movie The Eagle has flown is sort of a novel in a series The Eagle Has Landed  Touch the Devil  Confessional  and The Eagle Has Flown  Night of the Fox  Cold Harbour  and Flight of Eagles  The novels sort of follow the same theme although different main characters are involved in some of the novelsThis is a very entertaining novel which is worth reading you would definitely enjoy the story line   I agree with a lot of the reviews written by others that were a bit critical that this wasnt up to par for a Jack Higgins work It is one of his early works and his rookieness showsbut only in the beginning of the book I found it a bit simple to start but kept with it and after about  pages or so it really started to hook me and the writing skill got better and better and by the end I thought to myself now this is the Jack Higgins we know The book about twin brother pilots in WW one fighting for the RAF the other for Germany has the obligatory malefemale relationship thrown in and I think is nicely done It clearly is a mans book in my opinionbut I would tell anyone give it a try but stick with it it slowly develops into a very good story with a surprise ending   This was the nd book by Higgins centered around the Cold Harbour project during WWII Ive read and they have both been very entertaining The war and history elements are done well giving a good feel for the time but his biggest strength is building out the characters who all have conflicting emotions and arent just for country first This one has a time lapse part as starts and ends in close to present day with an author essentially playing Higgins himself who then writes the novel that makes up the bulk of the book He tied it together at the end in present day again with a final twist that isnt all that shocking but puts a great bow on things Definitely worth reading   "},

survived and is imprisoned in the Tower of London Liam Devlin also survived and escaped Heinrich Himmler and the SS again hire Devlin to hatch an escape plot to free Col Steiner British intelligence are trying to use Col Steiner as bait to catch Devlin and his coconspirators in EnglandMeanwhile Himmler and his rival Admiral Canaris the head of the Abwehr German military intelligence are joining Hitler at a conference in Normandy What does this have to do with the plot to free Col Steiner Theyre connected but youll have to read the book to find out how  whyThis book is a quick read I didnt like it as much as The Eagle Has Landed but its still enjoyable Liam Devlin is an engaging character despite being a skilled assassin  enforcer for the IRA    After reading The Eagle Has Landed and also seeing the film I always wondered what had happened to Colonel Kurt Steiner The last paragraph so skillfully written by one of my favorite writers Jack Higgins leaves a mystery Why Well Colonel Kurt Steiner accomplishes his mission in somewhat a different fashion and as life ebbs from his body the reader reads whatever else may be said he was a fine soldier and a brave man The suggestion by the author is that we all should let it end there But I for one could not So the years pass as they often do and lo and behold I came across the book The Eagle Has Flown This is a must read If you accept the challenge you will find out what happened It is another thriller with fast pace action where the main characters from The Eagle has Landed are featured again with some other nasty characters that seemed to have crawled out from under a rock I loved it I read it without putting it down from start to finish Now I wonder if this is the end I gave it five stars because it is a rare book full of adventure that keeps you at the edge of your seat I loved it    in the Liam Devlin series This novel is a sequel to The Eagle Has Landed  a  plot by Heinrich Himmler to kidnap or kill Winston Churchill The plot was foiled and Irish gunman Liam Devlin was wounded and escaped eventually to Lisbon while  of  German Paratroopers were killed The German leader Col Steiner was secretly held in the Tower of London In the sequel set in  author Higgins is shown documents showing the further actions of Devlin and Steiner in  He travels to Ireland and meets with Liam Devlin who relates most of what happened in a further plot by Himmler to engage Gen Schellenberg to run a plot to free Steiner and return with him to France for a meeting with Hitler Adm Canaris and Gen RommelLiam Devlin series  In this sequel to The Eagle Has Landed Devlin is asked by the Germans to parachute into England and free Steiner from St Marys Priory where he has been taken after being held captive in the Tower of London This sequel involves a plot to thwart the assassination of Hitler in order to prevent the nations takeover by Himmler and the SS   A good engaging easy to read but slightly predictable war based thriller starring Liam Devlin the character immortalised by Donald Sutherlands portrayal in TheEagle Has LandedThis time the Eagle gets involved in another similar sort of tale If there is any interest in this tale its mainly because it manages to portray a vaguely sympathetic portrayal of Adolf Hitler which certainly has you asking yourself a few questions But the questions dont tend to be too searching much like this eminently readable yet eminently forgettable thriller   httpajitabhpandeyinfotheeaglehasflownbyjackhigginsAnother excellent nd world war story by Jack Higgins This is in continuation of the first book in Liam Devlin Series  The Eagle Has Landed This book is written in the same style as the previous one Jack Higgins is the one who is being told the story by Liam Devlin In this book Liam Devlin is sent by Himmler to London in order to rescue Col Steiner from the British intelligence agency And this book interestingly turns out to be yet another plot to kill Hitler The book writing style is quite catching and does not let you easily leave the book in betweenJust like other Jack Higgins books which I have read earlier there is no unnecessary description and no unnecessary heroism in this book and I kind of like it that way   "},

"text": "Desperate Adolf Hitler orders the impossible kidnap or kill Winston Churchill A disgraced war hero receives the suicidal mission for a commando squad In a quiet seaside village a beautiful widow and a cultured IRA assassin set the groundwork for the ultimate act of treachery On  November  Berlin gets the coded message The Eagle has landed In all seriousness this is without doubt the BEST  STAR BOOK  that Ive ever read   I know I know on its face that sounds confusing and maybe even oxymoronical and may lead to a bit of head scratching or possibly even a mild rash For that Im truly sorry but please slap some calamine lotion on your itches and give me a chance to explain before you dismiss me as an oxy or any other form of moron Briefly this story tells the fictional tale of a German commando unit that attempts to kidnap Winston Churchill during World War II The book employs the story within a story method and begins with Jack Higgins as himself seemingly discovering the facts behind the unknown mission after finding the hidden graves of  German paratroopers at an English graveyard Curious he begins asking the local townsfolk and their reactions make him suspect that there is a great secret being hidden from the world After further investigation the rest of the story is Higgins recounting what he has pieced together through a combination of documentary evidence and educated guesswork I thought this was a very HIGH QUALITY book I found it to be a very well written story and I have zero complaints about the strength of Higgins prose In addition I think Higgins did an extremely good job of creating three dimensional nuanced characters that came to life and appear completely human including the German soldiers but more on that in a minute Finally Higgins did an fabulous job of constructing a well thought out highly detailed and credible plot In other words this has all the makings of an excellent novel as the VAST number of excellent reviews of this book can easily attest   So given all that slobbering fanboyish praise why in the name of all that is good and holy did I give this  ONLY  STARS First please stop yelling at me and I will tell you See as good as I thought the novel was on a technical level I found the story itself fairly dry at the best of times and actually quite boring at the worst of times Now boring or dry when dealing with nonfiction or even classics may still earn  stars or higher if they impart deeper meaning or just load you up with knowledge However fiction is different I read that to enjoy myself and so dry and boring become tough hurdles to overcome Here are my four main gripes One of the reasons Higgins cites for the popularity of the book in his introduction is that it was the first time that regular German soldiers as distinguished from those within the NAZI hierarchy were portrayed in fiction as human beings and not bloodthirsty monsters While the portrayal of German soldiers as regular people is certainly laudable I must disagree that Higgins was a trailblazer in this area Long before this book was evedwritten the world had been introduced to the following two loveable scamps  AND  How do you NOT love Klink and Schultzie So sorry Mr Higgins but as far as I am concerned Hogan and his band of Heroes beat you to the punch as far the humanization of the German solider is concerned Thus no points for groundbreaking cultural revelations  The fact that the final outcome of the story was known at the very beginning of the story took away much of the suspensemystery for me Now this is not always the case when reading about real life events in which the final outcome is well known as I have read a lot of historical ficiton and real life crime fiction that kept me at the edge of my seat However in this case the slow methodical planning of the kidnapping just never seemed to pull me in and so I found the story very slow moving  There were nonadazero OMG moments in the story which is a real let down for me as I would have expected some in a taut thriller of this kind For me OMG moments are those moments that raise goose bumps on your skin eg Jack Nicholson on the stand in A Few Good Men    or something that happens that makes you say NO WAY did that just happen eg for those that have seen  The Blair Witch Project  the final scene made me almost crap my pants  Basically they are memorable scenes that stick to my brain long after I have forgotten everything else about the book movie etc This book did not have a single moment that will stay with me for more than  minutes after I finish this review Thus no point there  Finally while most of the characters were well drawn there wasnt what I would call any real standout memorable character This is closely tied to  above Liam Devlin the IRA commando comes closest and is certainly a good character However when I finished the book I wasnt anxious to pick up the sequel and find out what Liam would do next He just didnt stir the curious in me FINAL THOUGHTSSo I didnt love this book I thought it was okay Sometimes when I dislike a book that the majority of my fellow readers rate highly I will either be thinking to myself what the hell were those people hopped up to rate this dung pile so highly and how can I score me some of that or Ill be thinking okay Im the dung pile and must have missed something or banged my head to hard as a child because I seem to be clearly mistaken on this one Well in this case I dont think its either though my status as a dung pile is certainly open to daily reinterpretation I completely understand how someone can love this book and at the same time am very comfortable with my it was just okay assessment So for all of the above reasons I just never found myself pulled into this one There were some parts I liked and it certainly had some moments but there were not enough of the goodies for me to be able to say I liked it stars    There was a time when I loved Alistair MacLean Jack Higgins Desmond Bagley the whole damn lot That was when I was brainwashed into thinking that Americans were good and Russians were bad that the Second World War was a just war where the Good Allies won and the Evil Axis lost that the Israelis were a peaceful people being continuously menaced by the bloodthirsty Arabs Most of my blackandwhite take on world affairs were influenced by popular Hollywood movies and thrillersThat time is long past but I would still rate this novel as one of the better ones as it presents Germans in a favourable light the noble and tragic antihero Kurt Steiner is a fantastic character          Bell                                                                                  John Sturges     Michael Caine Donald Sutherland Robert Duvall Donald Pleasence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I think Ive read this book before and seen the movie but I read it when I was in high school or junior highlong enough ago that Id forgotten the details If it were written today it would probably have a tighter POV and fewer pages spent on the setup Still its an awesome book Not squeakyclean PG but cleaner than average for the marketI think what impresses me most about this book is the way Higgins creates sympathy for so many characterseven though most of the characters are trying to kidnap or assassinate Churchill something I dont want to happen Higgins introduces the characters in a way that makes me like them and want them to achieve their goals Well everyone except Himmler and Colonel Shafto The characters are imperfect but admirable or funny or brave and though most of them are fighting on the wrong side of the war I understood their motivations and cared about what happened to them Ive talked a lot about characterstheres a whole lot of action in there too And interesting tidbits of WWII history The reader in me enjoyed the characters and the plot The writer in me loved his techniques   I read this book because it was recommended by Readers Digest as one of the best all time Needless to say that they werent wrong I enjoy reading war  related fiction  have read many books but what Higgins presented here was beyond doubt extraordinary Here are a few elements that I was amazed to see Fact or Fiction The writer did extensive research as explained well in the prologue  epilogue In fact the research is as important to the plot as is the book The only issue being central character of the plot was a heavy weight  I dont mean just someone I mean the big dog of WWII so it may be plausible that details of this operation never showed up cause the ramifications if they did were dastardly for many forces around the world I would leave that to you to judge I for one feel that IT DID HAPPEN A German War HERO Yes  I am not going to talk about him because words wont do justice to the courage character or clarity of thought Kurt Steiner possessed I am glad that finally we saw ONE yes only ONE war hero from Germany but what a Hero He made up for all the years I read  found all Germans to be on the Board of Directors of Satans Inc Again I believe that Kurt Steiner did lead that outrageous mission Character Portraits The writer did research thoroughly for almost all characters can be found by a simple Google search  read about Worthy to remember that this material wouldnt show up because of what it meant so details are grainy but there What is also stupendous is that each character  I mean each  everyone of them was essential to the plot What I enjoyed most was the Brotherhood amongst these warriors Each  everyone a just soldier unlike what we know Germans to be I felt sad every time as the narrative would reach the already foregone conclusion that all of them were to be KIA before the book reached its last pages Confused IRA Professional My second favorite character  God Blessed him with a great sense of humor In fact all Irish men seem to have ithe seemed to have the most of it In the whole book Devlin only once was genuinely sad otherwise it seemed to me that God gave him a little more of the happy hormones  none of the sad ones He shows what the War did in terms of choices  cause  I have come to believe that one mans soldier is another mans terrorist is indeed true Again Devlin lived till much later  met with the writer Conclusion I dont think I will ever read another book from Higgins as I am afraid he will let me down I also think that they should remake the movie the earlier one was made in the s but this generation must be given a chance to see Germans in a different light I am not saying I have turned for I hated reading about what all they did Himmler was Satan on Earth as he went about his wretched ways even in this book But there were indeed a few good men who were on the wrong side of the barbed wire   "},

foreverFollowing the death of Good King John Osten Ard is plunged into civil war as his sons battle for control of the fabled Dragonbone Chair  the countrys throne as well as the symbol of its power Simon is forced to flee the only home he has ever known a journey which will test him beyond his worst nightmaresWith The Dragonbone Chair Tad Williams introduced readers to the incredible fantasy world of Osten Ard and kicked off the beloved internationally bestselling series Memory Sorrow and Thorn He who is certain he knows the ending of things when he is only beginning them is either extremely wise or extremely foolish no matter which is true he is certainly an unhappy man for he has put a knife in the heart of wonder  Qanuc ProverbThe Dragonbone Chair is chock and block full of wonder If you have the patience to master this piece of work it is incredibly dense and filled with first class world building and heaps of lore youll find it an extremely rewarding experience It is a slow burner especially the first third of the novel titled Simon Mooncalf but once the simmer turns into a boil theres no stopping the storyRecommended for everybody who likes their fantasy served with a hefty dose of EPIC    The opening to what is easily the best fantasy series Ive ever read Williams Memory Sorrow and Thorn remains IMHO one of the most underread and underappreciated series out there I suspect that the length of the novels scares some people off Dragonbone Chair is the shortest and its still around  pages The series as a whole incorporates most classical fantasy elements an epic quest dark sorcery an unlikely hero etc but what makes it unforgettable for me is one main thing Williams nailed the worldbuilding While he retains a lot of traditional fantasy elements they all show up in new ways and forms I cant think of a single time where I thought This has been done before and thats rare considering the amount of fantasy literature Ive read The land of Osten Ard remains one of the most vivid locales in literature Ive read and its inhabitants are incredibly memorable as well    A classic in the fantasy field this is best suited for readers looking for the traditional orphanidentity quest While I enjoyed it overall I was able to set the book down and walk away coming and going from the story until Simon reached the woods I consider it a bad sign when Im able to set a book downmy favorites have me locked into reading position until I reach the end page Eventually it picked up and reeled me in but there was skimming involved A combination comingofage and castlekingdom political novel I felt like the book would have benefited more from focusing on one or the other As it was the politics were mostly the side story and I largely skimmed over those sections of the book without any real decrease in enjoyment of Simons story Its classic high fantasy with full landscapes and world building starting from the castle to underground tunnels to a deep forest to a deserted Sithi read elven city a highlands castle and a mountain When the book ends with Simon and other adventurers sent on a journey for a missing sword its almost shocking that its not a ring I like that Williams world contains nonhuman races There is the most interesting take on trolls that Ive read yetBinobik and his wolf quickly became my favorite characters The white hounds and the Bakken bring nicely frightening elements to the storyOne frustration is that Simons development seemed very uneven and unlikely to me that parts of his political and intellectual consciousness seemed so limited even when being taught by the doctor He does indeed behave like a fourteen year old boy at the beginning of the story and credit to Williams for capturing that well enough to be annoying Every time you turn around hes complaining about reading and his refrain lasts for some time even into his forest journey However view spoiler rescuing the Prince should have been the beginning of a political awakening   We very much get the boy buffeted about by the winds of fortune storyline but he remains clueless every step of the way Then suddenly he develops a sense of honor towards his kidnappersthat almost results in repeated injury by the Bakken This was the Simon who had no honor towards shirking workloads in the castle and who discovered a monk had fleeced himtwiceand has resolved to guard himself more closely Its that kind of uneven characterization that makes him frustrating to root for as a lead being so malleable and of almost no strong principles I did like that he was openminded enough to befriend a small personI didnt find the writing particularly impressive or beautiful and it is odd to have bold and italicized words The song lyrics are often distracting but occasionally add some richness to the story It feels like it was trying hard to be capital E epic and the cliffhanger ending is an annoyance Ill grab the next one from the librarybrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   OK heres the deal Ive met this author at a convention and he seemed a nice enough fellow and plenty of other people have read this book and given it four or five stars But I am an unusually picky reader I like high fantasy I could read Tolkien over and over again love Martin and have put away my fair share of Eddings Jordan and Brooks But I spent the first  or so pages of this thinking I would have liked this book a lot more if I were a still fifteen and b a boy I made it through to page  thinking the whole time that if I never hear the term mooncalf again will be overjoyed when he puts a cat into his tunic in order to save the cat who has just saved him And thats fine  except no place in the next  pages does he let the cat out of his tunic I wavered between thinking it must have been one of those things that happened off camera like eating and going to the bathroom and thinking did the cat die In his tunic Is he still wearing the cat Did it fuse to him It drove me nuts It kept eating away at me as I tried to read the rest of the book which was populated by about  different characters who had no distinguishing characteristics whatsoever Since most of the characters are pretty much written exactly alike with the exception of the what was he a gnome who stands out because he rides a wolf it would take me a page or two to figure out which character I was reading Id figure it out and then BAM I would be thinking about the cat in the tunic again So Im sorry to say I was really too fixated on wondering what happened to the cat to really enjoy the book and by about halfway through found myself skimming more than reading    This review refers to the trilogyTad Williams Memory Sorrow  Thorn trilogy was one of the first fantasy series I ever read and its still one of my favoritesThe writing style is very pleasant and the pace is slow enough to be savored but characters actually accomplish things by the end of each book you know what I mean The characters are welldeveloped and loveable but not annoyingly perfect This is a classic epic fantasy plot Simon the kitchen boy saves the world But please dont roll your eyes  this was written in the s  before it was a clich Even though hes now a clich Simon is still charming and you cant help but love himMemory Sorrow  Thorn is on my list to read again and along with Robin Hobbs Farseer Saga its the one I always recommend to newcomers to the genre Read more Tad Williams book reviews at    "},

is his destiny conquer with indomitable iron A man flawed filth and painfully mortal  a cleareyed leader with a strong distaste for wars necessary cruelties  he will know a glory unparalleled in historical annalsan ultimately will lose his heart and his kingdom to greatest betrayal of all This is probably the most definitive version of the legend of King Arthur in the last thirty years in my opinion Godwin has done his research and traces Arthurs origins from a highborn Romanized Briton in the twilight years of Romes presence through his rise to power and the creation of a wellorganized effective kingdom that is capableat least for a whileof holding back the encroachment of the Jutes Saxons Angles and other mainland tribes If Arthur actually existed well it could have been like thisGood as his research is thats not what makes this book so worth reading Godwin has the natural ability to bring his characters to life in a way that few other writers can match There are no minor characters in a Godwin book Everyone is there for a reason and everyone has their own story to tell be it Geraint Lancelot Guenivere Isolde Tristram even that legendary whippingboy King Vortigern gets his due Everyone is at once larger than life but very recognizably human and all play their parts for good or ill according to who they are and what they think is best Godwin doesnt stray too far from the broad outlines of the story of Arthur but within that outline he has all the room he needsHighly recommended   Very few of my adolescent loves have survived the rigorous critique I learned in graduate school This novel hasit enthralls and moves me as much as it did when I first read it when I was nineteen But its also very very smart one paragraph might contain Wordsworthian neoplantonism agrarian critique of industrialized agriculture matrilineal kinship relations and their ability to resist capitalism or pastoral food production as rebellion Historicism abounds as do striking ideological critiques that scream of Althusser However the action and the characters are also riveting Amd Arthurs voice is as humandamned AND sympatheticas any Ive read Ive loved every minute I ever spent with this novel    Even though Arthur drives me nuts I have a soft spot for Arthurian stories because theyre part of what launched me into being a medievalist That said this is one of my absolute favorite retellings because Godwin is pretty much a genius about characterization I know enough about the historical references of Arthur like History of the Kings of Britain and such to appreciate how much Godwin works into this story hes truly done his research including the BritonSaxonRoman clash of the th centuryI also like that all these characters are feisty Arthur is snarky Guenevere is totally sarcastic and fierceeven flat Percival has some spunk to him if only toward the end Theyre very real characters in a way that Arthurian folks often arent And the Morgana and Modred Godwin cooks up are some of the best fictional represenations out there I understand why they are the way they are rather than just there has to be a hubris flaw somewhereA fantastic read that will be staying on my shelves with the few other Arthurian adaptations I like that of Stephen Lawhead and Peter David if youre interested This was an Arthur I totally understand capturing the imaginations of generations truly giving Britain a standard to follow as the world turned over   Favorite QuotesTheres not a stone or leaf or life that men wont put a name to It gives them a nice safe

narrates his life from boy running around the hills of his stepmothers Roman style villa to a very weary aged king in his last hours after the inevitable battle with Mordred Lancelot and Guinevere and Merlin and Magana and Tristian and the Holy Grail and Camelot all dance through the pages as he chronicles his journeyBut its all just a bit different this time round  gritty and fantastic and familiar and alien all rolled into oneBetween Roman Briton and Saxon England we have the hazy time period when King Arthur may have ruled and Parke Godwin fills in the pieces here with  history  fantasy and  sheer basic human dramaIn this version Merlin comes now and then to visit Arthur in visions  he may be some sort of spirit he might be a Time Lord he might be some sort of weird time twisting in on itself allowing for Arthur to meet his future self or he might well be having hallucinations cooked up and served by his own brainGodwin seems to be going for some so of mystical or at list metaphysical kind of angle but more and more research today supports the idea that we humans do a lot of thinking and planning out and puzzle solving at a sub or unconscious level  so when we suddenly have a fully formed idea  the painter suddenly seeing the picture before his eyes fully formed the musician waking up with a full song in his ears the writer suddenly knowing the plot beginning middle and end  it isnt coming from the magical ether but rather a timer has gone off in our unconscious oven and the idea is ready to be looked at consciouslyBut I digressArthur goes on a lot of campaigns at first fully embracing the ideals of old Rome but pretty soon realizing that the glory days of Rome are long gone and whats more the only thing they are ever going to get from Rome are pretty letters dripping in perfume promising everything and nothing as the once magnificent empire shrinks to the size of a pinprick on the mapAnd then Arthur gets a lesson in realpolitik when he spends  months living feral with a very small tribe of nomadic short people who are going to go on and be the basis of tales of fairies and elves He falls in love with Morgana a matriarch of the group who teaches his the simple lesson of LoveBut he has to give that all up because There Is Work To Do Oh isnt there alwaysHe leaves her pregnant with a vague nagging feeling that may come back to haunt him later and oh boy does it ever with a vengeanceBut in the meantime there is a crown queen and country to claim and then the day to day business of holding on to what youve claimedWhen King Arthur lays out the whole mess with Guinevere he is a surprisingly fair narrator Turns out  he doesnt even care she was having a fling with ole Lance because he gets it that a person has ore needs than just one other person can fulfill but he DOES object to her taking the power of life and death into her hands That is so totally only up to him and no one not no one can make that decision but him and he is Royally Pissed OffSo she whips up an army of her own based on Righteous Anger to negotiate her way out of a cell to a bargaining table to back on the throne Which just proves my theory that throughout history the winners are always the one with the better army and better PR Just when Arthur thinks he might be actually be successful in keeping things civilized Mordred shows up and demands a reckoning    "},

"text": "Anne McCaffreys beloved science fantasy epic becomes a fullypainted graphic novel Join Lessa sole remnant of a noble house as she comes of age and dares to reclaim her birthrightand battles to save Pern from the deadly silver threadfall that threatens devastation of the planetBook one of three This classic has been hanging over my head for years I put off reading it guessing that like many other oldies but goodies I would read it and be unimpressed thus becoming hated by all original die hard fans I finally decided to give it a go The beginning suffered from a slow start and over abundance of useless description However it picks up about  in The thing that Im sure many many have said before me is the authors ability to weave fantasy based dragons in with science fiction Everything is so well thought of It was nice that the dragons finally have a purpose in literature besides just being powerful treasure hoarding beasts However the writing style was a bit lean for me In the emotional sense It was very cut and dry and I didnt feel make connections with the characters This also had a very historical sense about it Plus I hate politics and while minor still unpleasant Ill probably slowly make my way through the rest of the HUGE series but spaced between more current books A good read but nothing Id say is a MUST read Yup see here come the die hard fans to kill me    An original fantasy from one of my favourite authors First in the series I do prefer her later books but best to start at the start Pern is a regressed world initially a space colony the people have forgotten their star bound origins and the world has reverted to a feudal system The once revered dragon riders who protected the world from spores sent out by an orbiting asteroid are not isolated and resented for the tributes required from the fifes as the star has not been seen for  years But now it is returning and the remaining and much depleted dragon force must rally to protect the world once more   Huge fan of Anne McCaffreys work in general I discovered her books as a kid and they stuck with me throughout my life I dont normally read stories that fall into the high fantasy dragonheavy category but this is one of the best series out there on the same and well worth it to boot Theres more to it than upholding the otherwise massive body of collective fantasy work that defines describes dominates destroys and delivers dragons upon dragons upon dragonsThis series is what made dragons cool This was the beginning It deserves respect and recognition    I was looking forward to reading Dragonflight the first in the series of a trilogy for a number of reasons One I love reading books that are a series as I particularly enjoy character development and plot twists that you sometimes get with series Two I love fantasysciencefictionhumours stories Three I love reading So before I began to read this book I had high expectations However I became more and more disappointed because of a few thingsPOSSIBLE SPOILERSThe first was that I found that the book had a very slow start which also had way too many characters that became confusing and these characters soon became redundant There was a lot of unnecessary description which was not clear enough and did not build up an appropriate picture of the setting I understand that McCafferey deliberately set up her story like this because she wanted this as her setting This is not wrong to do and as the author she had the right to do this however I just felt that it was confusing and I struggled to identify with anything that happened over the first  pagesThe next problem that I had was that I had no emotion with the two main characters and I simply did not care about them The first character Lessa was to me annoying and she had no charming features at all I will admit that she was the character that developed more throughout the book than any other and she was portrayed as a typical rags to riches type however her actions at the beginning of the book which left an innocent woman dead and a child without both its parents was hard to understand as she had no grief over what she had done she was angry and rebellious and reckless throughout the story and then towards the end she suddenly changed her character and became another person just because the story needed her too I simply could not forget her actions at the beginning of the book which made it hard for me to connect to her If she was to be portrayed as an antihero then it simply did not workThe second character Flar is also unforgivable in all his actions especially to Lessa and his own admission of sexual abuse towards her and yet we are suppose to like him I found him violent towards her which was too graphic What was more disturbing was that no other character ever commented that his behaviour was unacceptable Towards the end Lessa even missed it Their relationship was one that was an abusive oneI understand that McCaffery deliberately wanted a Sciencefiction story covered by a fantasy adventure story and this is fine however when the genre did shift it was a surprise to me and at first a bit annoying as it seemed to shift too quickly For a new reader there was no steps or clues that would tell you that this was a timetravel story To me it just felt like a change of genre It was another thing that frustrated me about the storyI understand that some of the problems may arise to the fact that this is a fixup of novels by the author I understand that she even won awards for the two individual novels However as I have written it did not work for me However there have been others who I found were more successful in creating a better story I Robot by Isaac Asimov for example whilst using this literacy style which proves that it was this story that was the problemThe other problem was the Threads  I simply did not understand what they were and originally thought they were meteorites until I checked them out online and found them to be space born organisms from another planet which begs the question why did Dragons need to fight slow falling mushroomsAnd finally the solution to their problem was too easy and was without consequences and I felt a little rushed I will assume some of the questions that should have been asked due to part fives actions may be taken up in the sequel however as I will not be reading he sequel it leaves me wantingHowever after all that I did enjoy the mystery of the songs historical records element of the story and the way the characters worked them out I felt that this was clever and rewarding and I also enjoyed the time travel However I do think that both of these could have been done betterThe theme of not following tradition to save Pern was a good one and I did enjoy this teaching of the book This part of the book was done well and was clearThrough out this whole book I had a single thought I wanted to give up However as I do not do that then I was glad that I did not Although I struggled with this book a lot and decided that I would not be continuing with the series I was happy that I had read this book However I would not recommend it to anyone   I love this book The early Pern books are incredible in their world building and characters The people in this book are very well rounded There will be moments you want to strangle each character but there are other moments each major character will pull at your heartstrings and you will root for them and rejoice in their successI liked the way Anne McCaffrey doesnt use any more words than she needs to The storytelling is almost stark but that allows the story and characters to speak for themselves Most of the reveal is done in dialogue rather than description and each character has a distinctive voice I thought the story went straight from point A to point B to point C very conciselyI like this because Im a sucker for world building for romance not just sex romance and for stories about people realizing their potential Lessa is strong and spunky without being loud She is determined and resolute Flar is kind and generous also a visionary among his people but lacks the savvy and political foresight of his mate Lessa The two of them along with their irrepressible dragons band in an unlikely team to save the only world they knowI read this when I was  or so and have loved it ever since   "},

"text": "The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent bled dry by interminable warfare bitter infighting and bloody confrontations Even the imperial legions long inured to the bloodshed yearn for some respite Yet Empress Laseens rule remains absolute enforced by her dread Claw assassins For Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners and for Tattersail surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion the aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn the many dead But Darujhistan last of the Free Cities of Genabackis yet holds out It is to this ancient citadel that Laseen turns her predatory gaze But it would appear that the Empire is not alone in this great game Sinister shadowbound forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their hand UPDATE Ive just reread this book so Ive updated my review which you can find at the end of my little lovenote here Why Read The Malazan Book of the Fallen or A Love Note to Steven Erikson Okay not really the latterIf youve even attempted to read Gardens of the Moon the first book in the  book epic that is the Malazan Book of the Fallen youll see very quickly that youre not given much as a reader Its confusing its complicated its full of mysteries and myriad of characters and magics that you can easily become overwhelmed Not to mention Gardens of the Moon isnt nearly as wellwritten as the rest of the seriesNot the most ringing endorsement so far but were getting thereThe Malazan Book of the Fallen series is easily the most epic series Ive ever read The history is mysterious and murderous and vast the races are plentiful and old and the magic is as powerful as it getsHow many times do you pick up a book that sounds epic but you start to read and it really isnt This happens to me all the time Because of a drawback of the medium there can only really be a focus on so many characters Im not saying its a bad thing but it takes away from the epicness The consequences of a few characters may have farreaching effects and the history and world may even be vast but theres still no denying that the scope is limited It cant really be anything elseSteven Erikson does something that has yet to be seen in epic fantasy He has created the standard for what is truly epic Ill not deny that his characters suffer somewhat from this many seeming to be essentially the same but he has truly created a world that is so vast and detailed you wont careThis is also part of the genius The characters dont even know whats going on whos killing whom or why They rarely even know whos actually in charge And Erikson puts you right there with them In addition theyre the ones narrating the story which means you really have no idea who to trust This is yet another aspect of his genius because as humans we tend to want things to go our way to see things our way even to tell stories that go our way Many characters are humble enough to see their shortcomings but the story is told from very human people well and godsAnd like George RR Martin Erikson has no problem killing off main characters It IS the book of the fallen after allAnother reason to read this series is what I call the Superman phenomenon Erikson creates characters who have it all when it comes to magic or military prowess or swordsmanship or you name it They are allpowerful and when they clash it will blow your mindAt the same time he creates tragedy filled with pathos that at one point had me devastated for weeks This is not a bad thing not only is it good for the soul its powerful writing that evokes emotions in you so strong you feel like youve lost a friend when all you did was finish a book This makes me wonder how he can possibly be accused of having thin characters when he made me feel like that about themFinally and fittingly Erikson has written simply the best endings Ive ever read Any bit of confusion and believe me theres quite a bit in every book of the series is rewarded tenfold with an ending that you will never forgetFor most books you may get a hundred pages as you climax after  pages worth of buildup Erikson gives you at least  and in some books even more than this The Crippled God  the final book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen starts a part of the climax with  pages to go in the trade paperbackSimply put read this series When youre  pages in and you still have no clue whats going on its okay Ive been there too It will be worth it keep pushing on How many authors really trust you the reader to put things together on your own Have you felt how rewarding that is have you even been given the chance Nows your chanceAs Logan Ninefingers always says or rather his father Once youve got a task to do its better to do it than live with the fear of itUpdated ReviewThere are few books you put down and immediately want to reread Gardens of the Moon is one of those books for two reasons One its that good Two its that confusingOn a reread I already know I missed a lot the first time but I quickly realized I missed SOOOO much that first time and most of it is because I wasnt used to having to use my brain as much I was constantly amazed at how much foreshadowing is in this first book So much is mentioned from the origins of the Tlan Imass and Tiste Andii to the Jaghut and even a little about the Forkrul Assail And the epigraphs made sense They ACTUALLY made sense I always thought they might but they are tell quite a bit in fact Some I was amazed actually give away events in the following chapter but you have no idea when you first read it You wily bastard EriksonHand in hand with the foreshadowing Im amazed at the level of detail in this book theres hardly a sentence without extra meanings behind it But the problem is  you just dont know who to trust when youre going through this on your first time and its so hard to catch it when so much is revealed in such an offhand manner I still remember being so confused the first time and then figuring something out Thats what sold me on the series and why I still consider it one of the best if not the best out there A second reading sealed the dealHaving said that I also saw a lot of why people say its the least wellwritten of the series Its well done leaps and bounds ahead of most I think but it can be inconsistent For most of the series its told in third person limited and while that seems to have been attempted for most of this book there were instances where it drifts to omniscient within a section The pacing is also a bit off but thats not really any different from the rest eitherDespite that I stick with what I said above  These complaints are drops in the bucket compared to this vast epic tale filled with history and magic and plans within plans At the moment The Malazan Book of the Fallen is my alltime favorite series This may or may not change when George finishes his series in  zing but I have a hard time right now seeing how it will be possible to top Yes theres a similar level of detail and even camaraderie you feel with some of the characters but how do you top this kind of epic I dont think theres a better feeling in reading than figuring something out that the author withheld thats what sold me on my first read and what continues to make this my favorite out of  Stars Not even a second thoughtNote I also highly recommend reading this with a group or just checking out the discussions from the group read Ive been participating in Being able to toss around ideas and theories is priceless and having people to explain some of it is also very helpful   If only I hadnt put on that little black dress Perhaps that wouldve saved this one for me I mean not only did I put on the little black dress the one cutjusttothere I did the hair I put on the heels too Everyone who has that little black dress or is dating someone who does knows what heels I mean You guys have been in that mood where you really just want to go out paint the town red like youre Sinatra and are just as they used to say of kings in the mood to be pleased right Whoever your date is that evening will probably have to make very little effort for you to have a good time and indeed youre just fine with being the entertainment I would like to state here and now that I showed up for my date with Steve Erikson with the hair and the dress and the heels in this mood And it turns out hes that guy The one who will manage to irritate you no matter how many times you try to grin and change the subject no matter how many broad hints you might help him out with As with most dates youve gathered information on solely from the internet and wellmeaning friends he turns up late it turns out he has lied about his height is awkwardly insistent on telling you excruciatingly uninteresting stories the entire night while not asking you a single question about yourself and then is confused when you do not want to see him againSeriously I PUT ON HEELS FOR THIS ERIKSON Somehow thats always the most insulting part isnt it Everyone told me you were great This was supposed to be my happy fun vacation time with a happy fun book that I could geek out with my friends about and finally have something to talk about with them that did not involve Foucauldian analysis Marxist delusions academic drama or a thesis of any kind But nooooo Instead someones evil twin shows up and now I have to awkwardly tell all these people I like that I do not like their favorite bookIts just that this isnt a good book And not even that its not good in some literary way It is clearly not good in that way and it isnt meant to be I dont hold it to that standard It does seem to me to be trying to be good in a more old fashioned way more typical for fantasy it just wants to tell a rollicking good story But I mean it is a bad story I like stories Thats why I read fantasy in large part I like that feeling of the archetypal coming to life in an interesting way that shows the inner workings of the recurring characters that I see everywhere in my reading I like that sensation of a campfire at night and a bard repeating the history of a people with flickering flames and drama and shadows and pronouncements that you can only take seriously in that setting and which youd feel obliged to laugh at in the morning This is a bad story Its cool that Erikson doesnt need to spend a hundred pages explaining every detail of his world to us and given how complicated it is thank GOD for that but the reader shouldnt have to stop reading many times in order to try to straighten out whats going on who are these random people that keep showing up how does this new demon or magic fit into anything and most importantly all important why on earth should I careErikson definitely did not manage to make me care Its largely a function of the fact that there is such a huge cast of characters and he spends so little time developing any of their personalities When there is some sort of inner reflection by a couple of them or feelings it seems shunted in there to give his epic quest one of the elements an epic is supposed to have it feels like hes impatient with people being you know people and would rather get back to telling me about this super cool magic battle with a demon he just invented that just popped out of nowhere It was almost like people were necessary vehicles for him to create his fantasy world but that cool names and Houses and ranks Son of Darkness Knight of Darkness Queen of Light were the real point of the whole thing People are there for him to be able to have fights Honestly It seemed like it was kind of constructed like an RPG game a lot of the time Here is an action sequence After this your hero may explore this world and pick up coins and treasure to increase his value there is an epic quest but you can choose to get sidetracked by a bunch of others that involve various gods and spirits Then in between each quest theres that part where the game stops to give you an expository scene that advances the plot and you just watch and then you take control back and go on to the next action sequence Eventually you come back to the big quest and kill off the Big Bad and YAY YOU WIN I can certainly see the appeal of this construction as a game but I think as a book it doesnt work so well at least not for meIt certainly didnt help that in addition to the off putting construction and the poor character development the dialogue was absolutely laughable incredibly stereotypically exactly what satirists make bad fantasy writing sound like the plot was ridiculous he pulled a new thing out of his ass every five pages because well because His world building was incomplete too It felt like you could never trust it because he could just change it on you a minute later because he felt like it He doesnt hold himself to any rules Its like when youre trying to make up an excuse on the fly for why you were late for something I forgot my keys and then I got caught in a traffic jam and then I passed that and there was some truck that had dumped bunnies on the roadway and I had to help save the poor things and then I was almost here when all of a sudden Elvis appeared from the dead riding an elephant and well thats why Im late and its totally okay Theres no suspense because the main characters are sure to be resurrected the alternate dimension rebirth had me laughing so hard I was crying and the bad ones are either off screen introduced late or dumb Theres some attempt at shades of grey with one character the Adjunct but he tells me what the point is straight out about five times just to be sure that I get it and its not that interesting a point anyway so it kind of ruins it I liked the climactic end battle but I swear to you even while that battle was going on he was introducing new magic and people and not just going with the hundreds he already had after  pages of setting things up If an author feels the need to do that instead of relying on the payoff from the  pages he already has not good news Not good news at allI dont know I almost kind of feel bad saying all this It feels like Im making fun of someone whos just so excited to tell me about all this cool stuff he thought of that he forgot to put it in a coherent order It doesnt mean that the individual ideas he thinks of cant be cool he just hasnt figured out the other stuff he needs to make it interesting as well as cool But still lest we forget HEELS ERIKSON HEELSYeah still not over that Next date if there is a next date Im sensing some peer pressure coming my way from my crafty friends Im showing up in sweats half tired and in the mood to watch reality TV Something tells me things might go better that way   Now these ashes gave grown cold we open the old bookDark times have set upon the Malazan Empire Nine years ago the Emperor Kellanved was murdered and his most loyal followers purged by a ruthless and ambitious woman called Surly formerly the Commander of the Claw now known as Laseen thronemaster Under the rule of their new empress the Malazans have spread their empire across the known world and now the war rages in distant Genabackis With the Siege of Pale coming to an end Laseens attention turns towards Darujhistan last of the Free CitiesThe first tale of The Malazan Book of the Fallen takes place almost exclusively in the cities of Pale and Darujhistan and their immediate surroundings Yet despite of that the book manages to encompass an enormously wide range of different characters and storylines all occurring simultaneously And not only that but all the time the reader gets subtle hints that are easily missed about events yet to come Of course Steven Erikson has become rather infamous for all thisThe characters were pretty standard There were a few I enjoyed greatly most importantly Adjunct Lorn Kruppe and Anomander Rake another handful I liked well enough and a whole lot I found to be completely onedimensional and uninteresting Not that Im complaining mind you for such a situation must be expected from a book with as many characters as this oneThe writing style is a matter for debate I know many people like it and Ive also heard that there is a lot of development throughout the series and while I wouldnt call it bad I cannot say that I liked it either Eriksons style as stated by the man himself in the introduction is both fastpaced and dense That made this feel like a book I should have been able to read a lot faster but where I had to force myself to go very slow in order to avoid missing anything So sometimes reading the book caused a minor headache not because it was confusing I actually dont think it was but because I had to read it like I would a university textbook Looking away from all that though the writing itself is okay Not particularly impressive but still good The chapter introductions however were simply amazing I always like quotes and excerpts from inworld texts introducing chapters and when those come in the form of poetry its even betterLet me talk a little bit about the setting then which is by far the greatest strength of this book The continent of Genabackis is a land of many different nations and cultures and it seems that each and every one of them has a developed history From the Moranth to Darujhistan to the lands of the Pannion Seer Erikson has created a setting thats astonishingly enjoyable to read and learn more about Add to that the Tiste Andii the Tlan Imass the Jaghut and all the other nonhuman races and the fact that theres a whole world out there waiting to be explored and nine more books to do it and this reader for one is definitely happy with the latest fantasy universe hes been given the chance to seeI also felt like there was an advantage in having read the whole Chronicles of the Black Company before venturing forth into this series Glen Cook is according to Erikson his most important source of inspiration and it is already quite easy to see connections between the two series in this first novel Genrewise Erikson follows in Cooks footsteps and both the setting the writing and the characters are similar to the ones found in the world of the Black CompanySo in the end I really liked Gardens of the Moon There were intriguing stories fascinating legends of old epic duels between powerful wizards and mythic creatures appearing from the realms of the gods I did not enjoy it as much as I hoped I would but pretty close to how much I expected I would It is still far too early to see if this series will become one of my favourites but I certainly intend to find out   i feel like im being pretty generous in giving this  stars okay it is my good deed for  now dont say i never did nuthin for you steven eriksonthe cons so much where do i even start  the dialogue is a joke a sad flailing uncomfortable joke the kind that just goes on and on and i start to look away from the joke teller in embarrassment corny corn beyond belief  and the characterizations  so flat so trite and when they werent trite  just entirely unrealistic there are literally no stakes to the character of Paran because he literally has no character the attempt to establish him as a speakshismind kinda guy falls totally flat when you see him act like a jackass to the number  most powerful person in the land and then to some kind of Master of the Assassins he also acts like a jackass to GODS there is a difference between admirable pluckiness and the kind of bizarre behavior that is a sign of mental unbalance  i hate when nonhuman species act like humans in costume that is lazy writing or unimaginative writing take your pick this happens with at least a couple nonhuman speciesthe pros the imagination on display except for characterization eriksons imagination is actually a little breathtaking this is a fascinating and incredibly complex world so many fertile concepts just one after another almost overwhelming at times for example an insane wizard trapped in the body of a puppet running around various dimensions about a half dozen nonhuman species many of whom seem genuinely alien the two i mentioned above being the notable exceptionsa great sense of scope of so many larger things happening throughout so many places a floating moon palace the world took a while to understand but slowly but surely i was taken in and reading the novel turned from a frustrating experience to in the last third a truly pleasurable one the last part of the novel was read in a big rush  i felt like i read my eyes out that night in the end despite my issues i am now really looking forward to reading more of this series besides depth of character  excellence of dialogue are not absolutely necessary for my own enjoyment also the author clearly favors larger women two big ladies are represented as very attractive enticing even that was unusual to read and i loved it as far as the ladies go i think erikson must have great taste   This is my second reading of Gardens of the Moon Ive long suspected that the best way to read Eriksons Malazan series is to read it again I can now confirm that suspicion has been proved correct as far as this book goes I loved rereading this book There were so many times reading the series initially that I felt certain information and story arcs and characters just came out of left field But having read this first book again I am astounded at the sheer level and volume of foreshadowing contained right from the beginningAs a first time reader it is almost impossible to conceive of the notion that the author trusts the reader to discover the mysteries of a story for themselves One of the things I like about whodunit stories is the quest to discover the answers simply from the clues given in the plot But even then most such stories still end up withholding just enough information so that there was no way to discover the story from the clues Well this book turns that idea on its head You get ALL the pieces to the puzzles and when you have enough pieces Erikson assumes you also have the answers Erikson spends very little time and often none with confirming whether you were right or not Confirmation are mostly implied or inferred by dialogue andor what happens nextI remember on my first read that I spent about a third of the book thinking this guy couldnt write to save his life But around halfway when I figured one of the mysteries of the book all by myself the penny finally dropped Erikson was trusting me to figure things out but I hadnt been trusting him to give me what I needed And from then I was hooked on the Malazan universeThankfully that first time around during the initial phases of the book Eriksons style of writing included some fantastic imagery as well as some of the most badass action sequences ever that kept me coming back There are some fantastic scenes that you could paint in detail as picturesque snapshots Im thinking in particular of the epic mage battle over the city of Pale with the sky fortress hanging overhead and waves of power reigning down carnage Im thinking of mage assassins battling on the rooftops of Darujistan Im thinking of lords of war free falling from the sky to engage their enemies Dragons Tyrants A possessed puppet for goodness sakes And my personal favourite for snapshot poses of pure awesomeness  Anomander Rake  with his two handed sword that sings with the sound of thousands of enslaved soulsApart from the snapshot imagery  there are also some very intriguing characters The Bridgeburners in particular Quick Ben Then theres Shadowthrone and The Rope and the Hounds of Shadow And who can forget Magnanimous Kruppe who has a weak spot for pastries and employs his vast talent and magery to lift cakes and sweets vacuum cleaner style as he walks through the markets of downtown DarujistanOne of the difficulties I had the first time round is that I had trouble caring about any of the characters Part of that maybe that there is such a vast cast and the narrative doesnt impose on you who to side with in the conflict But mostly I realise now was because I wasnt paying attention Very little of the detail in the writing exists purely for background or to simply set the tone of the book Most of what you read is significant in some way Erikson wastes few words If a character briefly notices something in passing its your cue to pay attention By the time I cottoned on to this fact I had already missed so much and lost a lot of continuity And I knew it And I can tell you on this reread the clues and the detail and foreshadowing I missed the first time round is staggering Im getting answers that alluded me through the series in this very first book They were there hidden in plain sight all alongSo I say all that to say this re read was a different and far superior more enjoyable reading experience than the initial read And the level of detail is such that I think I could read this again and still get further revelations As such I am rerating this from  stars to a very firm  stars   "},

refused to read Harry Potter because of something I read in the back summary of the first book that lead me to assume JK Rowling was doing it wrong so I turned my nose up at the whole series Seriously I recall this vividly Kids say the darndest thingsAnyway the Dragon Chronicles series was one of my favourites for a variety of reasons  I loved that the dragons were intelligent misunderstood creatures who just wanted to live no different from any other large predator I also loved that the baby dragons act like any actual baby animals  theyre bratty difficult to control and sometimes unintentionally dangerous but with their moments of sweetness and silly mischief I liked that the protagonist was a tall awkward tomboyish girl  I could never relate to delicate waifs as a kid  and Kaeldra was enough of an outcast to appeal to my lonely nerdy self The series does have romance in it but its toned down to the point where its really easy to flatout ignore It doesnt feel forced or tackedon like romance tends to in a lot of other YA novels God I pray for the death of the love triangle as a plot point These are mostly stories about girls and young women thrust into complicated painful situations where right and wrong arent necessarily clearcut I loved that nuance just like I loved that the books are very sad characters die and have to make some very difficult choices Theres a lot of sacrifice and sweat and tears and blood in these books and when the characters are in danger you really feel like theyre in danger  theres very rarely that voice in the back of your head like Yeah right shes not going to kill off any important characters Nothing comes easy for Kaeldra and at many points in the book I ached with sympathy for herKaeldra makes a great cipher  you learn about the world as she does so theres not a ton of exposition dumped on your head all at once Her story was believable and her journey captivated me to the point where I read this book over and over and overIts worth noting that I also love the covers  the art is beautifulDoes it still hold up to my childhood obsession Nothing really does But I would absolutely recommend this book and the sequels to anyone with a young fantasyloving girl in the family If shes anything like me shell reread them until they fall apart   When I read a book I dont enjoy I have to read a couple books I know Ill love to get the bad taste of bad reading out of my head Its usually a more recently discovered comfort read but if it was a really bad book I might feel compelled to reach deep into the past and draw out a very old favoriteI read a very bad book the other day This book is a very old favorite I probably read it first when I was nine or ten and it immediately became a muchread favoritepossibly just because it was so different  I hadnt read much fantasy besides Tolkien at that point But it has been a very long time since I last picked it up so it was nice to go back to it I was kind of worried that after so many years it might not be as lovely as I remembered But it was even if it was not quite as epic or romantic as I remembered Its a lovely little book that I am glad to find I remain very fond of   Originally posted at Worlds AboundDragons Milk starts with our introduction to Kaeldra a young girl living in a small village on a farm with her adoptive family Unfortunately for her she is obviously the only Krag a type of people that are tall and blond in a village full of Elythians smaller people with dark hair When her younger sister Lyf contracts Vermilion fever Kaeldras grandmother reveals to Kaeldra her heritage of dragon speaking and that the only way to save Lyf is to get milk from a dragon Luckily a dragon dam just happened to return to their land after decades of absence to hatch her eggs I really enjoyed this book even in its predictability The book is short I finished it in a couple of hours and is perfect as a I dont really know what I want to read next but I dont want anything too taxing kind of book Kaeldra is likable and not constantly noble she wants to be rid of her dracling charges and go back to her normal life But she wont just leave them to fend for themselves Some parts were sad I dont want to say too much but this author is not afraid to kill off characters For those out there there really like some type of romance in their book this kind of has some but seriously very minimal There are three more books in this series but this one gives closure to Kaeldras story and the next two are about different characters I will probably check them out the next time Im in the mood for a light easy read but for now Im satisfied with how this played out Definitely check it out if youre interested in dragons fantasy and middle grade fiction Its a cute little book    I read this at least a dozen years ago What I remember there is a young girl possibly adopted but definitely less parentally favored who tries to save her sick younger sister with doses of dragons milk To get the milk she makes a bargain with a dragon But after the mother dragon is killed Kaeldra takes on the responsibility of the three baby dragons left behind She and a wouldbe dragon slayer traverse a surprisingly wellthoughtout fantasy world trying to keep ahead of their enemies    This book had a decent story but in my opinion wasnt very well written Its about a girl named Kaeldra who lives with her adoptive family She feels excluded from society because she is from a far away land Not only that but she has the green eyes of a dragonsayer one who can communicate with dragons When her foster sister Lyf falls ill her grandmyr sends her on a journey to retrieve dragons milk from a nearby dragon Kaeldra finds the dragon easily and eventually settles on a trade milk in return for watching the dragons  babiesThe dragon Fiora is killed by dragonslayers and the rest of the story is about Kaeldra trying to get them to other dragons Along the way she has to avoid a mysterious dragonslayer and disguise herself so she is not recognized as a dragonsayer The book ends with the hope that one day people will return to being at peace with dragons and then they can live on the earth againThis book is nonstop action which is good sometimes but in this case it seemed like the story progressed and randomly developed too fast Not a book that Id make an effort to recommend but an amusing and easy read   "},

felt as if I was reading a seventh graders failed attempt at a creative writing assignment Jane Yolen tries to give credibility to her appallingly poorly written story by adding adult elements like the constant reference to the bag girls aka prostitutes and blearyeyed abusive weed smokers She also invents cusswords for her world which she readily uses with gusto making me cringe as if she had actually used a real one She apparently does not know or understand the audience she is aiming for and therefore entirely misses her target Im not normally a harsh book critic but I wish I could rate this book with negative stars It was bleak and boring from beginning to end and I felt absolutely no sympathy for any of the clichd characters It felt like a cheap rip off of every fantasy novel since the birth of that genre they even greet each other with a version of the star trek Vulcan salute gasp I know there are more books in this series and Ive heard they get better But no one could pay me enough money to even pick one up    First I gave it a  Then I took a nap and realized it was closer to a  The world sounds beautiful but the characters are decidedly not I usually dont care much what

said anything to that effect in the entire book Your dad gave you to me and one day Ill have enough money that youll gladly accept me as your master facepalm She seems like the only decent character in the book I hope she develops her medical skills and sells his kidneys on the black market while he sleeps   This is a story about a boy and his dragon which takes place in a fantasy time period and setting Jakkin Stewart lives in slavery with other men and women they are known as bonders The only way to get free from bond is to become a master not only a master of humans but of dragons The book explores Jakkins journey into manhood as well as a friendship with a dragon hatchling The book starts a little slow but after the first three chapters Jakkin faces hardship after hardship from stealing an egg to fighting evil drakks There is even a love interest a mysterious girl named Akki Overall it is a good read for a young adult between the ages of eight and fourteen Despite being an adult I enjoyed reading this book However I found myself wishing the author had done more with the themes and issues that arose during my reading such as slavery the idea of a master and a slave the treatment of the dragons both in the pits the training and the horrible culling and finally the achievement of a dream was it really everything you wanted However since this is the first book of a trilogy I think Yolen will address the unanswered questions in the later books Most of my disappointments about Dragons Blood though relate to the way Yolen translated some of the themes for a young persons mindset Because of this many of the issues felt diluted or too easily solved   Reread in May  Im wondering if I got all the references to drug addiction and prostitution when I read this as a child because as an adult it leaves me baffled that a short simple supposedlyaimedatmiddlegrade story could be so skeezy Dont get me wrong I thought the worldbuilding was good but the bleakness and the Serious Issues most of the population are slaves and women are treated as objects seemed at odds with the simplistic narrationThe story is predictable but its kind of hilarious how useless the hero Jakkin is He steals a dragon which is later revealed to have been set up as a test so really not that impressive a feat and then sets about training it out in the desert but doesnt give any thought to how hes going to transport it to the fighting pits in the city He doesnt even register it or book it in for its first fight Of course its a woman Akki who thinks about all these details plus a million other things including saving Jakkins stupid life at least twice But instead of her competence and strength and extreme patience around stupid men being recognised we have to endure a lecherously awful scene where her father chucklingly tells Jakkin that Akki needs a strong master and Jakkin should be the man to take her in handUgh Head meet desk   I love dragon stories but this series disturbed me enough to sell them back Which is something I never doIt was a very difficult read for me and Im college age The intended age is for young adults I understand trying to teach children to be empathetic to nonhuman species as well as human but I wouldnt want to teach them with this bookSpoilers warningThe main characters start out by fighting these dragons sometimes to the death Then in later books the two heroes are reborn through a dying dragon which causes them to be permanently changed and disgusted with eating meat because they can now sense life like never before

Lightand seals his destiny as the hero of King Arthurs Britain Framed by historical realism Gillian Bradshaw expertly weaves convincing magical elements into her fantastic tale of Gwalchmai the So when I was growing up and madly in love with all things King Arthur my opinion about Who Was My Favorite Knight changed on a fairly regular basis based mainly on whatever book I was reading at the moment andor what part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail I was most obsessed with So I read The Squires Tale and I was like OMG GAWAIN FOREVER And then I read The Forever King and I was like OMG GALAHAD FOREVER And then I read The Mists of Avalon and I was like FORGET YOU KNIGHTS GIRLS RULE And so onAnd it didnt matter what exactly the books were about because I loved all of it the grandeur of the castles and the knights and the romance and the heartbreak and the betrayal and the quests and the magic and the devastation and the hope and so its REALLY surprising to me that I could not get into this book at allI dont know guys There was something very exhilarating about reading an Arthurian novel where Arthur was still running around kicking ass and uniting the tribes of Britain and all that as opposed to just sitting on his throne watching his wife cheat on him Plus the cover appears to feature Val Kilmer circa  ICEMAN YOU CAN BE MY WINGMAN ANYTIME But I could put it down clearlyI think part of it might have just been the pacingwhen Im reading four or five books simultaneously as I am wont to do its inevitable that the slowest one gets the least of my attention Sorry ponderous novels that require a great deal of focus I do not deserve youPacing aside it was the typos and the weird phrasing that killed this particular one for me Like this particularly bizarre paragraphLot was annoyed at firstAgravain had understood very little of what he had heard and on the occasions he did suggest some course of action it was invariably the wrong onebut Agravain was still the chosen heir to the kingship and Lot was determined that he should know the chief men and clans of the kingdom and how to deal with them However our father concluded that Agravain was still the chosen heir to the kingship and Lot was determined that he should know the chief men and clans of the kingdom and how to deal with them However our father concluded that Agravain was young and that the hunting was good that year and it was excusable for a young man in such circumstances to tire of the talk of his eldersWhatOr this oneThis is not a weapon for Men I am honored that you should think of it for me but I could not bear such a wordThats supposed to be sword for those of you playing the home gameI just couldnt deal with it especially given how many other books Id rather be readingAnyone know if the other editions were edited better Because I am willing to give this sucker another try typofree   Gwalchmai ap Lot the middle child of Morgawys and Lot learns sorcery from his mother to make up for his short comings as a warrior However his mothers sorcery is seething with Darkness and Gwalchmai flees the Orcades set on joining Arthurs warband Before making it to Britain he stays in Lughs domain for what ends up being three years acquiring the sword Caledvwlch and horse Ceincaled Will Arthur accept him knowing who his mother isIve read a fair bit of Arthurian fantasy over the years Forget Lancelot and Guinevere my favorites have always been the boys from Orkney or Orcades in this case Gwalchmai Gawain in most tales is an interesting character close to his younger brother Medraut and contemptuous of his older brother Agravain His journey from outcast to young sorcerer to berserker warrior is well done an interesting metamorphosis He can feel his heartbreak when Medraut goes down the dark path as well as when Arthur mistrusts him This story takes place just after Arthur is crowned emperor so hes still uniting Britain making it a nice change of pace since most stories have Camelot already established and Arthur more as scenery than a characterOne of the more interesting aspects of this book is that Bradshaw draws the story primarily from its Welsh and Celtic roots Gwalchmai is linked to CuChulainn on several occasionsId recommend this to any fan of Arthuriana with a few hours to kill and break from the usual Arthur trappings like Merlin Lancelot and Guinevere    I really disliked this book I love both historical fiction and fantasy and have really enjoyed other Arthurian books so why did this one rub me the wrong wayI think it was because in an effort to create the warrior of light this author took a path I thought we had long abandoned of old ways and old gods being a darkness needing eradication Students of history know of course that this is what happened that pagans were considered witches and heretics and even as recently as the th century witches were burned at the stake even for such evil acts as practicing herbal medicine I really thought that we had learned enough about those times to not glorify the practiceAnyway it started off bad for me and just got worse I gave up before finishing I dont do that very often but this author does not understand the history of the British people Also she seems to have mixed up the Britons and the Bretons Ugh This author wrote a great forward about using the old tales to create the magic in her book and I was really looking forward to it However having somehow read the history without understanding it instead she has cast the old Gods as the darkness and the new religion as the light with the Sidhe somehow supporting what was actually the brutal extermination of a religionI will keep reading in the hope that she redeems herself but at the moment I am ready to throw the book out the window I understand the concept of fiction of course and understand that the Arthurian legends were written from a Christian point of view However to claim to have added historical accuracy while doing the opposite is obnoxious and self serving   An Arthurian fantasy from the point of view of Gwalchmei later named Gawain this book caught my eye in a used bookstore because it is one of the few recent books Ive seen to draw almost entirely upon the earliest Welsh versions of the legend although some elements from later stories are incorporated for familiaritys sake by the authors own admission Nevertheless what that means is that many familiar faces are missingthere is no Lancelot and so far at least no Merlinand certain traditional elements are missingfor example Gwalchmei not Arthur weilds Caladfylch sp Excalibur This was hardly a deterrent for me though as I have long been fascinated by the early Welsh forms and this also weaves in a good bit of Celtic history and mythology Maelgwyn Lugh CuChulainn sp the Sidhe to create a very believable if not  accurate for the sake of dramatic license vision of th century Britain and Arthurs kingdom as it might actually have been   King Arthurs rise to power  its what makes England what it is in so many ways The overcoming of darkness and petty feuding between rivaling mini kings to be united together under one man  one king  and the lightThis is a lightly veiled intro into Christianity actually I dont really remember seeing Arthurs story that way but it is And  truth be told  this book isnt about Arthur per se Its about another character  Sir Gawain  and the complicated story of how he came to be the man he was and how that story fit into Arthurs life and times Its also a look at how a past power of faith collides with what is now a present one So it is both familiar and strange and that makes it a great story to read Somehow I was under the impression that this book was a standalone dont ask why  probably because I didnt hear about it first on Goodreads So I was mildly surprised to come upon the first few pages of the second book of the trilogy at the end of this one But glancing back I can see why it has to be Although this story is concluded you know the whole story isnt So it will be onwards with the next bookAll in all this is a great adventure book It took me some time to get over the names and keep the characters straight  and Im still unsure of some of them regardless of continually wrapping my head around the letters But that really is neither here not there as there are really only a few that youre interested in I like to keep the terrain in my mind so there was a map of sorts at the front side of the book for reference  although I thought it could have been larger and better illustrated Its pretty weak Considering this is not an imaginary place but the early times of Britain and I am not a scholar on all things historical on Britain despite extensive reading of fictional stories that is it would have been nice to have a better bloody map to track the where of the who But thats a personal pet peeve and if you just let it go and go with the flow the story is fine It certainly has a spiritual feel to the story which as noted before I wasnt expecting Certainly was expecting the mythical aspect of it  as King Arthur really is that  but not the spiritual It lent a fresh way to see it for me and I didnt find it unpleasant Onwards with the second book   "},

with allusions to a detailed magnificent history and a wider world that draws you in and makes you long to look under every stone and behind every tree for some new thread of Tolkiens magical tapestryyou get a clunky illformed world depicted by clumsy tinny prose that fails utterly to imbue any sense of tension and emotion into the narrativewell other than outrageEven the back stories of

take   Alright Before anyone goes into a tirade of why I gave this book a fivestar rating read onI was never the novelreader type I was never much of a novelist either I live in a Third World country so when I was young we kids amuse ourselves by learning to climb trees playing hideandseek and all sorts of outdoorsy gamesUntil I met Terry Brooks through The Sword of ShannaraA neighbor of ours was moving out and with the bulk of books and other stuff they have they decided to sell most of them Ms Susan saw me browsing through the books they were selling one afternoon and when I was about to leave without buying anything I had no money since my parents never really gave me money to spend on anything until I was in High School she beckoned me to come closer and gave me a seemingly old yellowedpagekind of book with the cover ripped off and no more first few pages For an eleven yearold kid it was kind of cradling a treasure add that to my overactive imagination hahahaThats when I started reading In earnestThe Sword of Shannara engrossed me In bibliophyllic terms I was heavily intoxicated hahaha Sure it had a very similar plotline with that of the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien which I found out years later when I was in college already but as you go further into the story you would see where Brooks originality lies Besides JRR Tolkien is Terry Brooks mentor It would be highly improbable if Tolkiens Middle Earth wouldnt rub off on any of his students DWhen I started working I made it a point to collect all of Terry Brooks works from the Sword of Shannara trilogy I bought a brand new hard cover version of The Sword of Shannara to the Genesis of Shannara books I would often end up comparing how beautiful was the first book the Sword of Shannara is compared to the rest of the following materialsWhere others see repetition I see consistency Where others see a ripoff copycat work I see one of the many variations in the seeds of literature that Tolkien sowed into the world of reading and writingTerry Brooks The Sword of Shannara will always hold a special place in my heart as it awakened me to the world of fantasy fiction and magic    Now this is what I like to see in a fantasy novel This has everything that makes the genre so appealing to me its got a diverse set of races and cultural systems its got both great darkness and profound good But most importantly its got history When I read books like this I want to feel like the fantasy universe has existed a thousand years prior and will exist a thousand years after With Shannara it feels like Ive stepped into the middle of a vast complex and beautiful world that has always been and always will be  The Epic Quest The wonderful adventure begins with two young men a wise and powerful historian and destiny the mightiest force of all One of the men is a decedent to the long dead elven King Shannara His name is Shae and he is destined to wield his ancestors sword the only weapon capable of destroying the mighty Warlock Lord and bringing an end to the tension that is about to cause an allout war Does this sound familiar I will address the Tolkien parallels later on in my review So bear with me Shae has no experience in adventure he has spent most of his life in his fathers inn so he has a mighty task ahead of him One in which he is naturally reluctant to undertake You see his life was fairly ordinary till the historian Allanon appeared and informed him of his quest Shae and his brother Flick turn to their friend for help Well I say friend I mean to say Shaes friend Flick hates Menion Leah he thinks he is a reckless waste of space This makes for a rather awkward and funny group dynamic one that sees a reluctant hero in the middle of his two greatest friends that dont stop bickering The trio depart run into a heap of trouble and get unbelievably lost The situation is amusing and desperate Shae does find his courage though as he learns to wield the ancient elf stones that the historian gave him They run into more danger and later more allies as the historian urges Shae ever closer to his all too important destiny  A party of desperation It quickly becomes clear that this is no simple adventure story I was really quite glad of this because it made the last parts of it really intense The group is forced to split up and rouse the allied forced to stand against the huge incoming invasion Its all tied up with Shaes destiny Evil is striking first with the purpose of preventing him from claiming the only weapon capable of severing the darkness Its one big race of survival with legions of foes marching on the lands of the heroes The sword is the only hope of victory Herein lies the heart and soul of the nationsHowever theres more to it than that Brooks forces of evil are not just some twisted things form the darkness They are races of goblins and trolls which are like the heroes They have been manipulated into serving a greater power They are not without redemption they do not have black hearts they have simply had their free will stole from them and then unleashed in a brutal war This for me made the entire conflict quite interesting it meant that there could be both great evil and good on both sides This can be seen with the great betrayal and the rock trolls that show reactance when they find Shae It felt like a real war but in a fantastical setting  Is it too Tolkienesque Is such a thing possible Brooks has borrowed heavily from Tolkien and I mean heavily More so than any other author Ive read Robert Jordan did this too but with Brooks the entire structure of the novel is like a condensed version of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Not only are there similar characters uncannily so but there is also an almost exact replica of the siege of Minas Tirith However the book is still worth a read Certainly the crossovers are a little annoying in parts but as a huge fan of the genre I cannot simply overlook what Terry Brooks does well This is his first novel and whist it resembles Tolkiens world I know that his later books dont entirely I think this book should be approached with a very open mind Its a simple stepping stone that Brooks has used to go on and explore his own world in greater depth in later books Its almost like he has used Tolkien as a crutch to get himself started with his own writing I cant condemn the book for this reason alone Moreover I like his writing style and his own influence can be seen in later books of fantasy and even some video games such as The Elder Scrolls franchise and World of Warcraft There are original aspects in here though they are few in numberTolkiens story was also that excellent that when a few early fantasy writers regurgitated it it wasnt completely terrible They could get away with it because they were the first to do it I have no major problems seeing the repetition here this is a great fantasy adventure I urge other readers to try it for themselves before they shun the author because of his copycat label because in this case its not necessarily a bad thing I for one will be reading the rest of the trilogy However I am hoping for improvements in the writing Im willing to enjoy this book in good humour as its the authors first book but if the similarity is constant I may not persist in reading another trilogy The Original Shannara Trilogy  The Sword of Shannara  Four worthy stars    A friend who was also into fantasy insisted I read this series and I got as far as the first three books before I stopped believing him when he told me they were magical and wonderful and would get better and better As far as I can tell they all have the exact same plot Mysterious Wizard shows up at home of person Tells person he is Chosen for an Important Quest What follows is chapter after chapter of I dont WANNA go on a Quest You MUST go on a Quest Seriously I know the reluctant hero who doesnt want tofeel worthy ofis afraid of his Quest is a staple of fantasy literature but this series takes it to a whole new level  the perpetually petulant hero Nothing but whine whine whine through the whole damn book And then the book ends with our hero crabby but triumphant and returning home and the Mysterious Wizard apparently dead or missing Only to turn up again at the beginning of the next book to browbeat the next whiny member of the Chosen Family to go on HIS Quest Lather rinse repeat Oh and the writing sucks too    "},

Twilight was such a book for me After reading several huge bricks containing complex tales all the while also reading tons of historical texts I needed something light and easy I picked this book after having considered it for more than a year and I couldnt have been happier with that choiceThe Dragonlance series is one of the pillars of modern fantasy and even though it contains any number of overused tropes it also produces new ones tropes that have been used by numerous newer fantasy series since the publication of this book back in There are of course quite a few downsides to the book Most of them are in some way connected to the fact that it is really simple The story is very straightforward the world is not as developed as most other fantasy worlds and the writing is not impressive in any way This could in many ways be considered a YA fantasy but even so it was a whole lot better than every single YA book Ive ever read beforeI also should mention that I found the book to be a lot funnier than even what seemed to be the authors intention Some characters like Fizban the senile mage were obviously just introduced as comic relief and it worked perfectly whereas others had hilarious sides to them like the dwarf Flint Fireforge and his extreme aquaphobia Perhaps it went a bit too far with the immeasureable stupidity of gully dwarves and the evil goblins utter uselessness in combat but hey it made me smile so Im not complainingOne aspect of the book I enjoyed quite a bit more than I had expected was characterisation According to most of the reviews I read before starting this the characters were generic shallow and onedimensional I could agree with the first of those to some extent but certainly not with the latter two Some of these characters like Tanis HalfElven and Raistlin Majere were really interesting though not on the level of my favourite Fizban They were not among the best fantasy characters Ive ever encountered but I liked them and thats all that matters The only complaint I can come up with is that the book is too short for the reader to really get to know them but with so many other books to read from this world I suspect that wont be a problem for very longThis was not a brilliant book and it had lots of flaws But what matters to me is that I really enjoyed reading it To be honest this rating would be way too high if I was considering the objective quality of the book But who cares about objectivity   Dragonlance was the first fantasy novel series I ever read so it holds a special place in my heart The Chronicles Trilogy was the first in a series of  core books There are probably well over a  books set in the Dragonlance world but these are the ones you need to readChroncicles TrilogyDragons of Autumn TwilightDragons of Winter NightDragons of Spring DawningLegends TrilogyTime of the TwinsWar of the TwinsTest of the TwinsTransitions to next generationDragons of Summer FlameThe War of SoulsDragons of a Fallen SunDragons of a Lost StarDragons of a Vanished MoonI especially recommend the Legends trilogy they are the only books I know to mix time travel and fantasy Also they are about Rastlin and Caramon by far the most compelling characters   Someone played a dungeons and dragons game which is based heavily on Tolkiens books and then decided to write down what their characters did and publish it And while dungeons and dragons is great fun for those playing it everyone has had to suffer through players who labor under the mistaken impression that their adventures are just as interesting to everyone else as they are to the playerSo then like you know this Orc came out of the weapons room but I rolled a  and I threw my  sword and it went right through his shield and practically killed him And so then like Arabella threw a level  fireball spell at him while Tantros cast an ice spell at the Orcs feet and so he was you know frozen to the floor like when the fireball hit him   Wow not a good wow I just read some of these reviews and ratings I have to raise my hand and be the voice of reason The public deserves thisLets get something straight here these books are unreadable for anyone older than  I love fantasy and I dont have an issue with the world building or the story here In my reviews I sometimes excuse poor writing characterization and other literary elements when the author does other things extremely well Most novels have multiple flaws and their relative importance to each reader will dictate how much enjoyment is sucked out of the read I could not excuse the literary flaws in this book They were repetitive sharp and massiveThe characters are as flat as pancakes At least pancakes have two sides These guys are so utterly simple I realize that this book was a relative trailblazer in the early s so its hard to say that they are stereotypes But they are stereotypes The first  pages basically consists of gathering members of the Quest They are picked up like gum stuck to your shoe theres no subtlety As every typical fantasy element was gathered for the Quest I wondered how this was different than LOTR other than being crappyI thought it would be interesting to read the annotated version of this book so I could see what the authors were thinking Normally this gives you insight into their thought process how this plot line impacts the overall story or some background information for characters that might be interesting Somehow the notations made it worse My eyes almost rolled straight out of my skull several times as the authors simple thought process was revealed to me like the opening of a pack of Kraft cheese singlesThe writing is simplistic to the Nth degree Ive never encountered so many adverbs in a single tome I only got to page  or so with my effort set to maximum Perhaps pages  and beyond are genius but Ill never know Ill live As a gigantor caveat Ill add that I would not discourage kids from reading this  it would be accessible and fun for them   My daughter is getting older now and asking me for suggestions on books that are age appropriate  her term I purposely havent read all of the Harry Potter books nor seen the movies because I was hoping to readwatch all of them with her Shes  and hasnt shown the slightest interest in those books but she just became interested in Star Wars this summer so Im willing to give her time I use this anecdote and the age appropriate tag because as a young lad in love with reading this series came along at the right time to fill a need I really liked these pulpy pageturning fantasy sendups lacking the creative stones of Tolkien I was a  year old boy Camus would have been lost on me  and if he wasnt I would have been carving Morrissey lyrics onto my forearm unironicallyI dont know whether Id recommend these to my  yearold daughter in  years time but if she is into light fantasy Ill do it without hesitation Would I ever read these again Not while there is still Camus volumes Ive yet to read and The Smiths Bsides to discover    "},

father and took over his lands Now the time has come for Lessa to shed her disguiseand take back her stolen birthright But everything changes when she meets a queen dragon The bond they share will be deep and last forever It will protect them when for the first time in centuries Lessas world is threatened by Thread an evil substance that falls like rain and destroys everything it touches Dragons and their Riders once protected the planet from Thread but there are very few of them left these days Now brave Lessa must risk her life and the life of her beloved dragon to save her beautiful world    I understand that this book and series has a lot of haters Their complaints are valid but I still regard this as one of the best scifi fantasies Ive ever read I started reading this series really young and got so caught up in the whole OMG DRAGONS part of it that I didnt even realize until later that this book had scifi elements namely that we are on a different freaking planet here Its a mishmash of several genres that worked surprisingly wellFrom the other reviews of the book Ive read the main complaints about the book seems to be the fact that the leading male character is kind of an asshole of the JerichofuckingBarrons sort Let me tell you that I hate JerichofuckingBarrons come ON I have a fucking shelf named after him for Christs sake Yes this book can be conveyed as being misogynistic but I dont think thats fair to the main characters Flar is an asshole at times but he needs to be tough and a leader Im not using that as an excuse Im just saying that his character was not over the top and he is not an asshole for the sake of being an asshole unlike JerichofuckingBarronsKeep in mind also that this book was published a long time ago  You have to make reasonable accomodations for that and this book was pretty well advanced for its days Lessa the main female character may be a bitch at times but taking into consideration her very difficult background her behavior is perfectly fitting with her characterHowever dated it is this book still has one of the most wellthought out setting Ive ever read in fantasy and scifi The dragons and how they came about the societal structure the culture everything was wellwritten and believableNo this book is not perfect but I adored this book and this seriesRead this review and more  The Book Eaters   What a disappointment It started out just fine with Lessa sole survivor of her family wreaking revenge on the evil dude who conquered Ruatha Hold The whole dragonhuman mind meld thing was okay too The part that really disgusted me was the whole rapingphysical abuse shtick by the supposed hero My thoughts were if this was my daughter as the heroine then the only thing to be done would bag and tag that Flar ahole cause I would have invented the  cal and then blown his head off with it I dont get why this was important to the storyline gee abuse the girl long enough and shell fall for you in the end Frankly thought it was stupidAnother thing that rally annyed me was the stpid apstrophe wy to spll evryones friggin nmes I want to pour scalding hot klah on the whole bunchThe premise that the world forgets within a few years a recurring extraterrestrial threat that destroys entire continents was idiotic If they really forget the whole technological base that enabled them to defeat the threads the whole society deserves to perish And threads are not a very exciting enemy wow look at them falling from the sky in clumps Dialogue sucks mostly Toward the end there were parts where somebody roared with laughter but I never saw anything remotely funny to cause itI was really looking forward to a long and interesting series but not here Good thing I didnt buy any of the followons I may have a tough time starting some of her other novels I have on the toread list   It always pains me when a beloved classic is just not good enough Dragonflight by Anne McCaffrey was unfortunately plain unenjoyableThe setting is the least intriguing one I have been faced with in quite a long time There was just nothing to pique my interest on the world of Pern In the authors defence she wrote this book in a time when only Tolkien had had the vision and ambition to take a fantasy world to marvellous complexity and long before the intricacy and skills of the likes of Jordan Martin Erikson and Sanderson surfaced to take up the mantle But I have seen many wonderful worlds in stories from before the current generation and Pern simply does not measure upThe plot was in my eyes horribly executed If if was supposed to be exciting it all happened in the wrong order with the wrong people and nothing ever went wrong in short no suspense was created nor any interest sparked and there was no reason to care about what happened As for the characters the most special part about them was the silly overuse of apostrophes in their namesDragonriders of Pern is inarguably entry level fantasy That is never a bad thing in itself and I am sure McCaffreys fans have reasons why they enjoy her books But personally this is fantasy on a level which I would not recommend to anyone and I would much rather suggest the heavily criticised Inheritance Cycle which was partly inspired by this series but in my eyes is far less overratedIn the end there was nothing to inspire or excite me in Dragonflight and not even anything to connect with The only thing that even slightly interested me was the combination of fantasy and science fiction elements which we of course see very little of   This whole review is a Spoiler so dont read it On the other hand nothing interesting happens in the book anyway so might as well save yourself the trouble of reading the actual book People of Pern Whats that in the sky Is it a bird Is it a Plane Is it SUPERMAN Ugh no Its those goddamned Dragonmen trying to filch our resources Dragon People  We are Dragonmen We will protect you from the evil threadsEvil ThreadsPeople of Pern Sod off theres no such thingLessa Aha The dragonmen are here I will use them to regain my kingdom Wait where are you taking me I dont want to be a dragonwoman I want to rule my kingdom Actually scratch that On second thought I want to be a dragonwoman Oh I love my dragon her eyes are so beautiful I want to get lost in themDragon Lessa  I hate Flar I like Flar I hate Flar Ill have sex with Flar Only because his dragon chased mine and raped her Dragon sex makes me feel so kinky BUT I STILL HATE YOU FLAR YOU SON OF A BITCH  Flar  Im having sex with Lessa and she is the Weyrwoman yet I will continue to call her girl because Im from the stone ageTime Travel is discovered HoorayEvil Threads start fallingPeople of Pern Oh no Dragonmen Dragonmen Save us The Evil Threads ExistEvil ThreadsDragonsFlar Ahahah I am so clever I knew this would happen all along Ahahaha Now if I could only get that Girl to love me Lessa  Lets time travel and bring more dragons Hooray I hate Flar I like Flar Im going to have some more sex with himEnd of Book    It should be stated that I squandered most of junior high reading Anne McCaffreys scififantasy novels nearexclusively but this was my first time revisiting her since then I was surprised to find that the first book in the Dragonriders of Pern series actually does have a good story with interesting characters and an excellent invented world However the writing is just abominable and in spite of being a woman McCaffrey is frustratingly chauvanistic The lack of copyediting makes me cry and the writing is something you just have to suffer through but the idea is really inventive and I can totally understand how I got so sucked into her books as a kid I wouldnt exactly recommend that you run out and check her books out but if you liked them back in the day revisiting them isnt as painful as you might have thought it would be   "},

"text": "Even as a young girl Jill was a favorite of the magical mysterious Wildfolk who appeared to her from their invisible realm Little did she know her extraordinary friends represented but a glimpse of a forgotten past and a fateful future Four hundred yearsand many lifetimesago one selfish young lord caused the death of two innocent lovers Then and there he vowed never to rest until hed righted that wrongand laid the foundation for the lives of Jill and all those whom she would hold dear her father the mercenary soldier Cullyn the exiled berserker Rhodry Maelwaedd and the ancient and powerful herbman Nevyn all bound in a struggle against darkness   and a quest to fulfill the destinies determined centuries ago Here in this newly revised edition comes the incredible novel that began one of the bestloved fantasy seers in recent yearsa tale of bold adventure and timeless love perilous battle and pure magic For longstanding fans of Deverry and those who have yet to experience this exciting series Daggerspell is a rare and special treat Daggerspell is an epic fantasy novel built on the idea of reincarnation If we have failed to fulfill our destiny in one life we are compelled to return to this life in another form to do that As I read this novel I was confronted with my feelings about that inalienable destiny There are some people that you have in your life that seem only to bring pain and hardship and the comfort is that when you leave this life you leave that pain they cause you behind In this novel that is not the case And more importantly a person cannot run from themselves and the anguish their own actions will deliver them In some ways that was a bitter pill to swallow as I read The blessing in this novel was that one man Nevyn which sounds like no one has lived through three lives and walks that anguished road with those people who he failed to help the first timeAnother integral part of this novel is the Welshlike feel to their world Im not an expert on Welsh language so if Im wrong I apologize But it felt as though this novel used some of the Welsh language particulars and it felt pretty distinct and authentic to me I was afraid that the names and the language would be an issue but it wasnt After I read the novel I read through the glossary and surprisingly I was able to discern what most of the terms meant through context The CharactersNevyn and Jill were standout characters for me I felt deeply for Nevyn The huge burden of seeing people he had cared for in the first goround suffer through their Wyrd destiny again and again until they got it right That was tough I loved that he had followed his own destiny not without loss or sacrifice and had used this incredible skills as a dweomerman magicianwizard to help people and to fight for the forces of light In the first life he made a selfish choice and it cost the life of a woman he loved He had vowed to help her find her destiny and it took him three life cycles to do it Thats determination Jill was young but she had substance and a strong heart One of her choices in this novel gave me heartburn For a romantic I was surprised I didnt want her to follow that path and go in another way Im glad that this worked out despite my apprehensions about it Cullyn was also a compelling character He had me worried a few times He was a man who had one heck of a wyrd to work out and it was a rough one What I loved is that he was able to overcome that dark destiny through the power of his integrity and love for his daughter Rhodry was a character that didnt quite convince me he was worthy of Jill He was a decent person a little spoiled but I didnt feel he was Jills wyrd at least not in a good way I guess the author knows better than me about such things In the first life cycle it was like watching a car wreck before it happens I mean literally That really took me out of my comfort zones I was actually shouting at the book saying Please dont do that It took some fortification to keep reading after that but part of me couldnt let go of this story because like any good fiction novel it made me ask the central question What happens next Im not a believer in reincarnation but the way things work out for the characters in that life cycle kind of made me glad that it exists in this novelMagic and Magical FolksI loved that Jill could see and interact with the Wildfolk Especially the cute gray gnome who was often her boon companion and her comfort through her tough young life I liked this idea that those marked by the dweomer are able to perceive the Wildfolk It was also interesting how many normal folks feared the magic and many more didnt even believe in it It seemed strange to me since this felt so real and their lives were deeply affected by the power of the magic around them I appreciated how within this landscape of humanity there were pockets of legendary creatures such as a dwarf metalsmith who gives Jill her silver dagger and the Westfolk who are actually elves I really liked the elvesMy final thoughtsI went into reading this cold I had never heard of this book until it was recommended on the fantasy group I saw it at the bookstore and thought Why not And I am glad I read it I think the writing was strong the storyline interesting although a bit on the tragic side in some ways It felt intricate and complex and deep and that appeals to me The idea of having to work out the consequences of the choices you make in life resonates with me and for a foundation of a fantasy novel it works surprisingly well I think I would like to continue this series to see where Kerr takes this story and the characters next I recommend it to readers who enjoy epic fantasy   Kerrs Deverry series is a classic in the epic fantasy field and its no surprise why World building is excellent detailed and consistent she does an amazing job of bringing early almost primitive Welsh culture to life albeit a culture with more magical tendencies than our own From a village tavern to the womens hall in a lords dun to riding patrol through a forest it feels earthy and real The magical system is a kind of sophisticated spiritualism that is vital to development of the plotOne of my favorite things about the series is the complexity of character development We witness people struggling with personal and political issues occasionally failing but occasionally overcoming challenges with grace I particularly enjoy how women are developed though the culture is at heart sexist we see the many ways women take power for themselves at different levels of society from the common lass Jill to the lady of the dun Lovyan Also notable is Kerrs refusal to glorify violence even as one or two of her characters are some of the most feared swordsmen around An additional noteworthy aspect is that Kerr includes nonnobility classes without glorifying their struggles or minimizing the role they play in maintaining the nobilitys lifestyle One of the central concepts to this series is the idea of Wyrd an aspect of destiny combined with reincarnation Characters are not completely fated to a particular course of action but will find themselves repeating illnegotiated challenges until their soul gets it right The central characters in this series are drawn together across space and time because four hundred years ago family obligations injustice and tragedy occurred in such a way as to bind their threads together Nevyn a sorcerer known as a dweomermaster is the only one of the people in this situation who is aware of the cycle of Wyrd and one of his goals is to connect with the others as they enter their new life cycles and correct his mistakesWhat adds depth and complexity to the overall plot is that the characters are working out their Wyrd in three different time periods As we go back in time we also experience the culture in earlier forms allowing the reader to get the sense of development of society Somewhat unfortunately names are in dialect and it lends itself to confusion in keeping track of each person and their three names The first time through I found it confusing but I was younger then Its a shame I only discovered the reincarnation end notes after finishingit might have helped me keep some of the namespersonalities straight during the three periods covered On reread the time changes flow better and the situations playing out slightly differently in the second time period adds to the sense of tragedy to the first and hope for the thirdTruly a great read for those who like complex epic fantasy Star one worldbuilding Star two character development Star three nicely developed plot with what could have been very conventional fantasyyes there are serfs and nobles and battles and elves and even a dwarf but they are done in a way that feels real and emphasizes the loss as much as the magic Star four complexity in all of the aforementioned categories The beginning Deverry series achieves a rare pathos and likely spoiled me for many subsequent fantasiesCross posted at httpclsiewertwordpresscom   The Deverry saga is a long fantasy saga but the great thing is that the it is organized in cycles the first one being the first  books The Deverry cycle And at the end of a cycle you get a real endingSo if you hesitate to buy this book thinking that youll have to wait too long to know the end dont Youll have a real ending at the end of book The story is set in an alternative th century Kerr imagining a celtic culture having survived and evolved into the Middle Ages thanks to a group of Gaulishlike people having settled long ago in a new territoryOur heroes are Jill Rhodry Cullyn and Nevyn Rhodry is a young lord threatened with death by another lord and his army for an unknown reason Jill orphan of mother since she was  but now a young adult follows her father Cullyn on the long road He is a silver dagger a mercenary a dishonoured man kicked out from his warband and compelled to sell his service here and there She too now is a silver dagger probably the only girl having ever done that but she has never known anything else Nevyn is a very smart and old herbman Or rather this is how everyone sees him He is actually a fourcentury year old sorcerer or more precisely dweomermasterThe dweomer is at the center of The Deverry Cycle This is the name given to magic A magic common folk is afraid of or dont believe in but that is truly known only by long trained dweomermasters The dweomer is a very spiritual magic it gives you the possibility to use telepathy with another trained mind to meditate to see omens etc A dweomermaster is also able to see and communicate with the Wildfolk gnomes sprites undines or salamanders elemental spiritsSpirits that Jill is also able to see an ability denoting her predisposition for dweomer And Nevyn mission among others is precisely to bring her to the dweomer and to train her but he cannot force her He can drop hints but the choice must entirely come from her A difficult task that unfortunately he has failed to accomplish several times in the past when Jills soul lived in other bodies And he will have no rest until he accomplishes itThe great originality of course of this saga is to make the readers discover in long flashbacks the past lives of our heroes This creates a very deep psychology of characters and is just fascinating The depiction of both the system of magic and the spiritual world and the fictional th celtic culture are enthralling Kerr has obviously done quite an amount of research on both these subjects before beginning her saga Ive always liked it when you can relate fantasy or fantastic works to history and this is definitely the case here I admire the blending of historical references and pure imaginationThe thing I also completely dig is Kerrs writing and I definitely dont understand why some reviewers here criticized it One thing for sure her sytle is literary and I guess some people find it tedious because theyre only used to read books with very basic styles However it is not difficult at all to follow her writing which is very visual direct and lively No overlong boring passages every sentence hits its targetI saw some people complained about the incest and the sexual scenes Its true that Kerr doesnt hesitate in taking risks with her story and she explores new territories And this is really enjoyable You read something new something daring Anyway Kerrs writing is always classy and careful and the books remain material suitable for teens theres nothing sordid here The sexual scenes not yet in Book  are necessary because a dark character is involved in ritual sex and later a protagonist is sexually abused Kerr is not showing our heroes making out Those few sex scenes are here to serve as key points in the story and are not described in visual detailsConcerning the incest that is at the center of Book  there is no scabrous details and that people would stop reading the book just because it talks about it is very weirdTo finish I really recommend this book to everyone I lent the first book to my best friend and to one of my teen student and they both loved it They bought all the others D   Ehmm A friend of mine recommended this book to me and now I regret reading it This book really wasnt my type of book Not that I have a particular type but this just isnt itFirst I have to confess that the only reason I finished this book was because I went on a trip and hadnt thought of bringing more than one book This is something I deeply regret WhyThe story in itself isnt all that bad I find the overall plot quite intriguing actually but not all the politics in this book Frankly I was bored out of my mind The only times I were interested were when we finally got Jills point of view and it didnt really happen all that often Some of the parts I didnt really understand why were there in the first place Year  anyone I get that Aderyn is important but less words please And I really shouldnt be complaining since I have no trouble reading G R R Martin but still I have a feeling that most of the parts I felt were unnecessary will be explained in future books but Im not sure if I have the patience for that I particularly had some trouble with the incest part of the story It isnt exactly like it was approved of in the book but the fact that he almost couldnt help himself just made me mad Just because you love someone deeply you dont have to want to fuck them THIS BOOK WAS REALLY ANTICLIMACTIC The evil guy just escapes And his minions just die What Oh and yeah Exile BECAUSE HE DID SOMETHING BAD IN HIS LAST LIFE Maybe Im just in the wrong mood but I will definitely not be reading this again    This is the first book in Katharine Kerrs longrunning series about Deverry and the Westlands It introduces the three linked characters of Jill Rhodry and Nevyn This book  and indeed the series  is set up in such a way that it will jump from future to past and back again It can make for complicated reading and an issue with pacing but it genuinely brings the events to lifeThe idea is that in the year  Galrion who is to become Nevyn makes a series of decisions that causes his lady love Brangwen to turn away from a life of dweomer the name for magic and become embroiled in an incestuous relationship with her own brother Nevyn makes a vow that he will never rest until he has put things right Consequently he is unable to die and experiences the characters being reborn again and again while he tries to bring Brangwen to a life of dweomer Jill is the latest woman that has the soul of Brangwen The strength of Kerrs writing is not so much in the story itself but in the characters who inhabit it and in the way she is able to tell each of the short stories about one of the lives that Brangwen lives Her ability to invest you in what is essentially a short story is exceptionally goodThere are some tired cliches  the Elves for instance Here called the Westfolk or the Elcyion Lacar they are nomads with pointed ears and cat pupil eyes They are foreign to the humans and able to see the Wildfolk  the denizens of the etheric planeI also got frustrated with two recurring overuses of description Many of the characters especially the women toss their heads Constantly Many of the characters keen in mourning Frequently Barring these two things the writing flows wellI enjoyed the heavy Celt flavouring to Deverry it was tied richly into the story I do have a small complaint that a number of the names are familiar and Kerr does not bring on the characters of those in the secondary string enough for you to tell easily between your Pedyrs and your Daumurs I thoroughly enjoyed this first instalment of the series and will read onwards eagerly   "},
{"title": "Dragon Wing",
"isbn": "0553286390",
"author": "Margaret Weis",
"text": "Preeminent storytellers Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have redefined epic fantasy Since the publication of their Dragonlance series millions of readers have enjoyed their imaginative worldbuilding rich characterization and intricate storylines Now these bestselling authors bring their talents to one of the most innovative fantasy creations ever in Dragon Wing the first volume in The Death Gate CycleAn assassin and the royal child he has been hired to kill form an unlikely and unstable alliance as the plots of human sorcerers elven pirates and dwarf revolutionaries threaten to overwhelm the airborne kingdoms of Arianus I did not expect to like this one as much as I did Sure Id heard good things about the series and had always kinda meant to read it but just about everyone who raved about it or about any of Weis and Hickmans combined work would talk about how amazing said books were when read at a relatively young age So when I found this one used and cheap I was in a mood for epic fantasy but wasnt considering much more than funNow dont get me wrong fun is probably the best word to describe Dragon Wing but its really really welldone fun thats more complicated than it seems when you think about it and expertly crafted escapism is Ive always thought just as lofty an artistic goal as any other I used to insist that it was the MOST lofty but Ive finally come around to literary works which isnt to say that I prefer themThe thing about this book that really made me realize Id been grabbed by it was when it occurred to me rather suddenly that I didnt know who the heroes were nor if there would even be one Again Id come into it expecting welldone but generally tropefulfilling fantasy and I knew it began a  book series so I expected that pretty soon Id have my hero and my villain and know who I was rooting for The style of the book is so entertaining and at times genuinely funny and fun that it took me quite some time before I noticed that I was following disparate characters with no idea of how this was all going to work in a plot context nor which sides theyd be on when they collided It doesnt call attention to its moral ambiguity like say A Game of Thrones does I loved that book by the way but its there nonetheless Theres only one main character who seems genuinely decent good and wellmeaning and hes largely useless Within the last  pages or so I finally had a handle on how I felt the series would as a whole go but it was a more interesting one than I had anticipatedThis is just one way that the book defied my normal fantasy expectations It is on the one hand a very classic fantasy world with elves and dwarves and wizards and dragons but at the same time it splits them up in ways that other worlds only hint at or changes them altogether Elves as violent bigots and dwarves as oppressed but unaware proletariat was pretty great shades of Wagners Ring Cycle in there actually and it was handled very well I did not expect so much of the book to be caught up in dwarvish internal politics but it was great when it did in no small part because the dwarves  or excuse me Gegs  were great fun to follow and the free indirect voice was good at picking the right moments to move into someones head and the right moments to view the whole world with ironic detachmentThe characters in general were engrossing and especially so because I really didnt know what each of them would actually end up doing Certainly not every one was amazingly wellrounded but what was there was great and what wasnt there wasnt necessary for the story to keep bounding along At times the dialogue could feel a little cliche or try a little too hard to be funny but it was never distracting The depth of the worldbuilding and the ambiguity of the plot keep things moving at such an entertaining clip that many times I had to stop for a moment and think just so I could realize how dark some of the themes had gotten and how bleak the world we were looking at actually was Now thats good escapism   This is certainly an example of thinking out of the box as far as world building is concerned Im not too sure how to approach a review of this book Ive never read the Death Gate Cycle before and I must say that this book left me intrigued I did initially have a struggle wrapping my mind around the world of Arianus and the different realms The maps and diagrams in the front of the book certainly helped One or two of the characters left me cold but that didnt really alter my reading experience Lets face it the worlds being presented here is almost a character in its own right I did enjoy the surprises and twists although the intrigue political and otherwise being presented here is not nearly on the same level as what can be found in other series I think that actually helps the plot in this case where too much skulduggery could seriously bog things down There are secrets and conspiracies though and enough adventure to keep the pages turning I would recommend this to people who intend reading the whole series Its blatantly obvious that some loose ends are only going to be resolved right at the very end Like I mentioned I wasnt sure how to approach this review I couldnt help but feel it might have been better to wait until Ive finished book seven On the other hand by then I would likely have forgotten what I wanted to say in the first placeAnyway Ill not go into plot details This series has a large following it seems and most folk likely already know what its about It is Fantasy with just the slightest touch of Mechanical SciFi if that is even a term I enjoyed it and will check out the sequels Oh and the cover art is pretty cool too So if youre into Dragonlance era Fantasy that is reminiscent of Dragonlance whilst still being something else entirely you might want to check this out   I split the review for this up Too long  too lazy to read admit it I first read these as a teenager and I was completely and utterly hooked Its been roughly fifteen years since then and of course the reading experience changedThis is scififantasy at its hugest form Tolkien has created a massive fantasy world in all its glory The Death Gate Cycle can rival Middleearth in its magnitude though Im not sold on its ability to speak to peoples imagination Weis and Hickman wrote something that entwines scifi and fantasy and adds tons of physics magic and very nonsensical moments to the mix This book is characterdriven and it is hard not to get involved From the unreadable Patryn Haplo to the lamentable Jonathan book  Fire Sea to the overconfident proud Xar and the very intriguing and oneofakind truly Zifnab I always felt like W  H had done their utmost to create characters you wanted to read more aboutWhen youve grown used to Alfred you can actually feel other characters despair most notably Haplo when Alfred  once again  faints in the face of danger As their bond grows I was often torn between God no and Hell yes I love how in the end they interact like lifelong friends Dare I use the word bromance Hell yesIt is impossible not to feel endearment and frustration at the interaction and evolution of the relationship between Jarre and Limbeck the dwarven rebel couple in book  Dragon WingOne can only love the dog who roughly goes by that name dog and who is ridiculously important for Haplo Wont say Spoilers He has

lot of trouble and truly got on my nervesIll get to Hugh the Hand and Haplo elsewhere These characters were the reason I got sucked into the stories What how why when Take me on this adventure and show me all this world has to offer   Im rereading the Death Gate Cycle because its been a long time and it seemed like a good summer series The first book is amazingly spry in that they dont bog it down with endless details and make it carry the entire worldbuilding burden Plus they are pretty sneaky by starting the reader off with a main character Hugh the Hand who isnt really the main character at all yet he makes a good entry point for the reader You think you are getting some pretty standard fantasymedieval realm story and then you realize that this will be something quite different Enough details about the world and upcoming conflict are hinted at but the world and story can be enjoyed as a stand alone effort in this volume Especially engaging are the Gegs and their world involved in KickseyWicksy a giant machine that no one quite remembers what its supposed to do and yet the entire race of Dwarves lives to serve it and actually worship it Our main antagonists Haplo and Alfred are introduced and by the end of the book I was sucked back in and ready to read the next one A good start and I thought this held up surprisingly well after so many years away   The Margaret WeisTracy Hickman novels make up one of those corners of the Fantasy genre that you either enjoyed in your teens and remember fondly or you didnt I have to admit that Im of the latter camp and while I strongly suspect that there was a time when I could have greatly enjoyed Dragon Wing that time has passed me by These days Im a little too jaded and Ive read a few too many works in a very similar vein Dragon Wing isnt bad necessarily but Id be lying if I said I particularly like itIt starts well mind you as master assassin Hugh the Hand is employed by the king for that most politically

{"title": "The Children of Hrin",
"isbn": "0007246226",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "It is a legendary time long before The Lord of the Rings and Morgoth the first Dark Lord dwells in the vast fortress of Angband in the North and within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the war waged by Morgoth against the Elves the fates of Trin and his sister Ninor will be tragically entwinedTheir brief and passionate lives are dominated by the elemental hatred that Morgoth bears them as the children of Hrin the man who dared to defy him to his face Against them Morgoth sends his most formidable servant Glaurung a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless dragon of fire in an attempt to fulfil the curse of Morgoth and destroy the children of HrinBegun by JRR Tolkien at the end of the First World War The Children of Hrin became the dominant story in his later work on Middleearth But he could not bring it to a final and finished form In this book Christopher Tolkien has constructed after long study of the manuscripts a coherent narrative without any editorial invention It has been said that all good things must come to an end In this case the end of Children of Hurin also marks the end of my quest to read a book by each of my five favorite authors It seems like a fitting way to end this journey in that Tolkien is the oldest of my favorites and if there was ever a modern author suited to endofquest tales it was Tolkien He was also the author on my list that gave me the greatest concernnot only has he passed away but his body of published work is relatively small I didnt want to reread the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings not because I dont love them but because I wanted to be able to read something new just as I had with the other authors Having read the Silmarillion several months earlier I was hard pressed to think of what else to read Sure I could have gone for Letters From Father Christmas or Farmer Giles of Ham but neither of those somehow felt right Tolkiens tales of MiddleEarth were what cemented him as one of my favorite writers and I wanted to go back to MiddleEarth as part of this projectFortunately the publishing gods smiled upon me and gave me Children of Hurin This is another in a line of books composed by Tolkiens estate taken from various notes fragments and other unfinished writings and molded into a coherent whole In that respect for the record its very well done The text flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter and I never once had the sense that I was reading something out of place or inauthentic This feels like Tolkiens writing and if it isnt exactly what he intended I have to believe its pretty damn closeBut what of the story itselfThe story of Hurin and his offspring is told as part of the Silmarillion but not in the detail that Tolkien intended Tolkien believed that this story was one that could be told apart from the Silmarillion as a wholethat it was strong enough and vibrant enough to stand on its own And he is absolutely correctChildren of Hurin is an epic Its also a tragedy If you come into this book expecting glorious battles and happy endings you will be sorely disappointed though if you come to Tolkien expecting nothing but happiness and light I submit you havent read Tolkien very often or carefully This is not a tale of good triumphing over evil but a tale of a family brought down by an epic curse More Macbeth than Star Wars in other wordsThe writing itself is epicChildren of Hurin reads a lot like Beowulf or the Iliad Tolkien apparently originally tried to write the tale as an actual epic poem but was never quite able to make it work Still his prose captures that same spirit rhythm and cadence As a huge fan of epic and epic poem I love itDespite the epic prose and tragic scope the characters of Children of Hurin are very well crafted and ultimately very human Their actions while not always rational are often understandable and while the tragedy has its origins in the supernatural it is Morgoth who curses the line of Hurin there is not a strong sense that the plot is forced simply by supernatural means Instead we get the sense that these are perhaps well meaning but ultimately deeply flawed people who suffer for their choices and the choices of others The final scene of the book when Hurin is finally reunited with his dying wife is absolutely heartbreakingTheres also a wonderful scene much earlier which really stuck with me and I need to mention it here just because its so wonderfully crafted It occurs shortly after Hurins capture by Morgoth when Morwen his wife is trying to figure out what to do with herself and her children Turin the son says something to the effect of I know my father is dead He must be because I know that his love for us is so strong that if he were alive no chains could hold him and no amount of enemies could keep him from returning to usAnd Morwens answer is I do not think either of those things is true my sonIts a wonderful if completely heartbreaking moment where a childlike view of heroism clashes completely with the harsh realities of the world It strikes me as a very Tolkienesque moment in many ways much of Tolkiens work deals with the interplay between heroics and the personal cost or realities of those heroics At least thats my initial thought In any case its an immensely powerful sceneThe text of the book is aided by the wonderful illustrations done by Alan Lee who has done a lot of Tolkienrelated art in the past His illustrations are interspersed in no particular order throughout the book but each one of them is gorgeous and really adds to the flavor of the text It would have been neat to see some more of themThis is yet another Tolkien book Ill be rereading in the future Its a fine addition to the Middle Earth canon   As a general rule I try to write my reviews in a vacuum as much as possible that is before I read through the other reviews already here I am not going to be able to do that here I have spent more than twenty years with this story since my mother first read the Unfinished Tales version aloud to me when I was eight years old and if Christopher Tolkien had not put this volume together I might have eventually had the hubris to do so myself Let me start by making a couple of points First this is not a new book in any sense of the word other than it is now standing on its own between two covers and without visible editorial apparatus for the first time Second Christopher Tolkien cannot be said to have written any portion of the narrative of this book despite many reviewers intimations to the contrary The bulk of this text appeared in Unfinished Tales with significant gaps Tolkien the son has filled in these gaps using the relevant sections from the much more concise version that was used in assembling The Silmarillion as well as framing material at the beginning and end of the current volume also from The Silmarillion Christopher Tolkien has done little more here than the literary equivalent of very carefully stitching a few patches to mend the gaping holes in an otherwise noble and beautiful garmentOn to the story itself then This is as so many others have already noted with varying degrees of enthusiasm a very dark tale If you dont like very dark tales well then you will quite likely not like this It is also in a prose style as is the vast bulk of Tolkiens work that is very susceptible to being called stilted because compared to contemporary prose it is But as at least one reviewer here has wisely noted the tone is in keeping with the tone of the Nordic sagas of which Tolkien was so fond of and inspired by And like so many ancient sagas and myths this tale is about an entire family haunted by a doom they cannot escapeOr is it I think that Tolkien has done a wonderful job here of subverting the curse of Morgoth and the doom of Hrin and his kin with another motif free will Tolkien who strenuously avoids almost any hint of allegory throughout his vast imaginative work nevertheless imbued almost every corner of that world with reflections of his own deeplyheld Catholic convictions and sensibilities The core of the story is the tension between doomfate on the one hand and free will on the other Trin makes decision after decision that invariably lead to tragic consequences But does he do so because he is doomed to do so Or because he is a man of haughty pride who stubbornly refuses to consider any viewpoint but his own using his considerable gifts natural charisma and rightfullylegendary physicalmartial prowess to charge willfully forward regardless of even foreseeable consequences to anyone and everyone around him I believe that it is very much the latter but without necessarily completely repudiating the former The malice of such a being as Morgoth is a very real force in the tale of the Silmarils and such malevolence bent upon a single family and largely upon a single individual as Trin rises to prominence can be understood to have tangible effect on individuals and events And even on a more mundane level the incursions and aggressive actions of Morgoths forces both the marauding armies of Orcs and the Easterlings who occupy Trins childhood homeland can be understood to push Trin in a particular direction in his life that he might not have gone had circumstances in his life and in his world been otherwise So there is some range to the senses in which Morgoth can be said to have cursed the children of HrinBut Trin has also grown up the proud child of a proud mother effectively orphaned from the age of nine he receives ostensibly every advantage yet the pride instilled in him from the earliest age tragically unravels every opportunity he is presented with from his youthful fostering in the halls of Thingol onwards It is his human choices not the supernatural force of an evil will that guide him on his tragic path and this complex narrative thread is what makes this to my mind one of the greatest of all of Tolkiens tales    Instead of The Children or Hrin this book should be entitled The story in which view spoilerEverybody Dies  by JRR Tolkien Oh My God And here I thought only Shakespeare wrote good Renaissance tragedies Really This story is so tragically sad I forget it was written by TolkienI wont write a summary for the story but Ill write down some things about it that might persuade you to read this amazing book Elves and more Elves If you like wise brave elves who like to fight a lot and are good with a sword and a bow read this  Dragons Evil firebreathing monsters that destroy everything in their path kill half of the characters and torture the main charactercheck Revenge Always a good reason to ruin your life Stubborn flawed cursed main anti hero Who suffers a lot MiddleEarth A nice little walk across the Middle Earth west of the Blue Mountains Its Tolkien ok Do you need more reasonsOk ok Here maybe these nice pictures convince you to read thissourcesourcebrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   The Children of Hurin is not a for people who saw the Lord of the Rings movies and then read the book Its for hardcore fans The people who remember all the names from the The Silmarillion Or for the few people out there who reread Beowulf a lot The Children of Hurin reads like a Nordic SagaAs a self proclaimed Tolkien Fanatic I enjoyed The Children or Hurin The Heroic epic and ultimately tragic life of Turin and his sisters Its not more The Lord of the Rings but it continues to paint a more vivid tapestry for the Fellowships stories to play out againstThere are a number or jarring transitions in the book Evidence of the unfinished state Tolkien left the tale in But this actually gives a more authentic feeling to the story Like a recovered Saga or Epic that is missing a few passages Hurin is high fantasy and if it were not set in the world of Tolkiens other stories it would be as unaccessible as the Kalevala Even with its grounding in the world of hobbits it is a book for the few not the many   The Children of Hurin provides some great historical material to Tolkiens world of MiddleEarth and adds even more richness to the Lord of the Rings This addition to Tolkiens extensive historical background of Middleearth fills in the gaps and fleshes out stories that have been mentioned and hinted at in other works by giving us a detailed and colorful look at the tragic story surrounding Trin and Ninor Hurins children and the ongoing battle against Morgoth the master of the Lord of the Rings evil character SauronThis is a welltold tale with engaging characters and plenty of action that keeps the reader interested throughout While not as enthralling as the Lord of the RIngs Trilogy or as entertaining and wonderful as The Hobbit The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to the MiddleEarth cannon and is a more complete novel than most other source material that is out there It stands on its own well and one does not need to have read any of the other histories to follow along with what is going on hereOverall a solid work that Id recommend to fans of Tolkiens works or epic fantasy in general   "},
{"title": "The Neverending Story",
"isbn": "0525457585",
"author": "Michael Ende",
"text": "This epic work of the imagination has captured the hearts of millions of readers worldwide since it was first published more than a decade ago Its special story within a story is an irresistible invitation for readers to become part of the book itself And now this modern classic and bibliophiles dream is available in hardcover againThe story begins with a lonely boy named Bastian and the strange book that draws him into the beautiful but doomed world of Fantastica Only a human can save this enchanted placeby giving its ruler the Childlike Empress a new name But the journey to her tower leads through lands of dragons giants monsters and magicand once Bastian begins his quest he may never return As he is drawn deeper into Fantastica he must find the courage to face unspeakable foes and the mysteries of his own heartReaders too can travel to the wondrous unforgettable world of Fantastica if they will just turn the page One of my favorite books of all time this one is definitely closest to my heart Ive certainly read it more than any other Enders Game being a close second Which is interesting because its almost nothing like any of my other favorites besides maybe Watership Down Maybe its because its the first main character I was able to identify so well with Or because Bastian does what I had always dreamed of to enter inside a book to turn your imagination into reality And this book really is an ode to imagination and story tellingThe first time I read this I was probably about  or  and it was after seeing The Neverending Story II in the theater Till then I had never known it was a book and just happened to notice it in the credits Thank god I did The fact that it lead me to the book is probably the only redeeming factor of that movie I read the book all in one day from morning till night with nothing but the same lunch Bastian packed for himself in the movie I may have cheated later on at night Its tough when youre not actually hiding in the attic of your school but lounging on your bed And Ive probably read it at least once a year since then Even as an adult am I really one of those now I still love being transported to this world and I think its a testament to the power of this book that it can still take me there From Atreyus quest to Bastian coming to fantastica to their travels and adventures and Bastians eventual journey home Im with them the whole way A secret part of me still hopes that the Childlike Empress will appear before me and that I can join Bastian and Atreyu for real in fantastica Till then the book and my imagination will have to do For anyone who loves reading through and through and who still has that sense of childhood wonder inside of them please read this book    I have actually never written a review for Michael Endes utterly amazing The Neverending Story I have also never read it in English I first read it in German in the early s I believe and I have reread it regularly over the years Die unendliche Geschichte is one of my alltime favourite German childrens literature books I simply adore itI love everything about this book including the ingenious way the chapters are arranged as well as the different colour fonts red for reality blue for Fantastica or Phantsien in German For me the different fonts are not only an ingenious plot and narrative device they also represent the separation of fantasy and reality However the fantastical first letters of each of the  chapters representing the  letters of the alphabet are all at least in my own copy of the book presented in the same reddish font as the parts of the story that take place in the real world even for those chapters based wholly and entirely in Fantastica this shows on a visual level that while fantasy and reality might be separate spheres and different from one another they are nevertheless forever linkedI remember when we were reading this very novel in the Childrens Literature Group one of my GR friends Kirei asked if the story actually ever did end I have to admit that when I first read the novel as a teenager I kept searching for other novels by the Michael Ende about Fantastica as he was always hinting at precisely that eventuality but that is another story  until I finally realised that this was also a plot device At first this bothered me a bit I felt a bit cheated But then I realised how ingenious this particular plot device was and is It solidifies Michael Endes belief that every book is a neverending story and that books engender other stories and so on and so on Furthermore for a reader who might become somewhat nervous and apprehensive when reading exciting or frightening tales the fact that the author claims that there will be more future tales of Fantastica gives a reassurance that Fantastica will survive that the nothing the emptiness will not succeed in destroying fantasy and the realms of fantasy In the first part of the novel the main emphasis seems to be mostly on the importance of fantasy and how the lack thereof is detrimental to not only the realms of Fantastica but to the real world to reality as well While the story is not openly didactic it does possess an obvious message against pure materialism and the disallowance and discrediting of fantasy The childlike empress will succumb to her illness and with her all of Fantastica unless a human being can enter Fantastica and give the empress a new name humans used to regularly find their way to the realm of fantasy but they are seemingly losing this ability or are perhaps unwilling or afraid to make use of it And while Bastian does in fact possess fantasy and imagination he is at first too unsure of himself to give the empress the name he has created for her moon child Indeed the empress must resort to trickery and subterfuge in order to persuade Bastian to finally utter her name to stop the nothing and to become part of the world of FantasticaIn the second part of the story Bastian is then given the opportunity to use the power of his own imagination his own wishes and desires to reconstruct Fantastica At first it seems that there are no limits imposed in fact the empress actually tells Bastian that he should do what he wishes what he wants There are internal limits though namely that Bastians main responsibility his main goal is to find the nature of his one true his dearest desire which is something that Bastian only learns slowly bit by bit And it rapidly becomes obvious that Bastians desires to be strong and courageous of wanting to change his outward appearance are not only not his actual true wishes they portray that Bastian at this time only uses imagination and fantasy as an escape from a world that he does not like very much a world where he can neither love nor be and feel loved Bastian thus does not truly reconstruct Fantastica by creating new realms of fantasy he uses these mostly to escape from both reality and his own personality In fact Bastian becomes quite dictatorial even attempting to usurp power from the childlike empress Luckily for him this proves unsuccessful and faced with the loss of his memories Bastian finally realises that his dearest wish is to love himself to be able to love that without love there truly is nothingThe Neverending Story demonstrates and demonstrates quite clearly how the interaction and interplay of fantasy and reality of Fantastica and humanity only succeeds if one strives to use fantasy and imagination to improve reality and that because Bastian is unable to love either the world or himself he uses fantasy not to improve reality but to escape from it This causes him to almost become permanently stranded in Fantastica which might at first not seem such a bad result except that becoming stranded in Fantastica also means losing ones memories losing ones soul and sanity In the end it is almost too late for Bastian and basically even though he has realised what his greatest desire is love it is only Atrejus friendship which allows Bastian to regain all of his memories and be allowed to return to the real world Atreju takes over the responsibility of finishing all of the stories that had been started by Bastian and it is this which liberates Bastian allowing his return to realityWith Bastians return we also notice that Bastian has not only learned how to love and allowed his father to love again he has also learned to take responsibility for his actions He himself goes to Mr Coreander to tell him about taking the book he does not rely on his father to do this although his father does offer The main point of The Neverending Story at least for me is and always will be that imagination and fantasy are essential for life and happiness but that they must also not be used to simply escape from reality from the world that they must be utilised in a responsible moderate temperate manner They are to be used as a tool an enjoyable tool but a tool nevertheless as a method of allowing fantasy and reality to exist together in harmony    I loved most of what I read yet Im stopping on page  I just cant continue And you know Im not entirely sure why I cant continue  I just know that I cant But I have a theoryHaving loved the movie version of this in my youth the whole story is etched into the part of my psyche that deals with childhood that time when so much is new where much in the world is observed through an innerwonder of the mind and a stirring of the soul a magical state by adult standards Freud may have been a kook with some of his beliefs but psychologists today with all their studies and timetested proofs and technology measuring brainwaves chemicals etc now heavily emphasize the impact our childhood has on our adult self And self is everythingMuch of what I read captured me putting me in a state in which I was accessing stirredup feelings through a strange inner memory that Im incapable of generating even partly on my own without help as an adult The inability to directly replicate the magical feelings that used to be a normal part of our existence as children yet somehow being aware of them in some odd way now is in part I think why our childhood has the power to affect us so greatly Even though past thoughtprocesses cant be fully realized our greater psyche has a keen memory of them  it knows exactly what once existed And sometimes we can reinvigorate hints of what we felt during parts of youth through songs pictures books and movies and if its something that was specifically wonderful to us as children all the more magical and powerful our hint of feeling now will be if triggered properlyI hadnt seen the movie in many years not since youth in fact So reading this swept me into that childlike place of consciousness where everything is awash in wonder Each piece of familiarity was somewhat cognizant yes I knew I had experienced these scenes before through the movie but the feelings they evoked were wonderfully vague and surreal awakening reminding some part of my innerself how the world seemed when newness and innocence ruled the day an encompassing sense of past magicThe movie version is completed at the books halfway point so it shouldnt have been a surprise that that was when my captivation vanished The book is very well written and fantasy fans are sure to completely dig it its a smart engaging book with important themes But its strong pull left me and I was unable to continue in the same state of enthrallment and wonderment Just like now as an adult I can never truly feel like a complete child again I can only hope to get dashes of that former self and can only do so in rare circumstancesBut when I am gifted such magic I will gladly take it and realize it for the priceless treasure that it surely is    Like many people of my generation I loved the film adaptation the first not the second thank you and never realized that it had come from a book until a number of years later In fact I read it the first time in  and not only was I delighted at how imaginative it was I was flabbergasted joyfully so that it lived up to its nameIts quick reading by any standard but so deliciously dense in imagery mythology and an engrossing plot that I swore that if I had any children this would be a staple of their dietNow that I have a little girl Im just too anxious to start reading it to her I really cant sit still I keep picking up the book and going Is she old enough yet Is she Is she Then I set down the book and tear out my metaphorical hair and let out a forlorn cry Then I get a fantastic ideaI could just read it again for myselfThen everything is right with the world again and Im able to write a new review This is easily one of my favorite tales everAn extra goodie April had a great review that forced me to think and respond in I hope a comprehensible way Check it out Aprils Review   Read this to my daughter recently A very mixed bagFirst off I should say that although the book was written in  it reads as though it were written in  The translator has consistently reached for the most complicatedhigh falutin word available and as a result the childs book ends up unreadableincomprehensible to many modern kids Im not one for dumbing down but this goes the other way pointlesslyI saw the film around the time it came out years ago The book seems to reach the end of the film by about half way through That first half is cleverly done with a good idea about binding the reader and the adventure together in a meta way that works out really well The pacing is ok the imagination great  chaotic but goodFor me Ende should have stopped there and wrapped it upThe second half of the book feels never ending Its a slow overdone meander through a fairly arbitrary world and the  year old I was reading it to we finished the book on her th birthday was like me less than gripped We soldiered on and on and onEventually the massively drawn out moral lesson  reconstruction of our heros personality completes and the final scenes of reunion are quite touching and upliftingSo the first half was a  for me the second half

"text": "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit Not a nasty dirty wet hole filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell nor yet a dry bare sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat it was a hobbithole and that means comfortWritten for JRR Tolkiens own children The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in  Now recognized as a timeless classic this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins the wizard Gandalf Gollum and the spectacular world of Middleearth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero a powerful and dangerous ring and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent The text in this page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics  and includes a note on the text by Douglas A Anderson  Unforgettable Some books are almost impossible to review If a book is bad how easily can we dwell on its flaws But if the book is good how do you give any recommendation that is equal the book Unless you are an author of equal worth to the one whose work you review what powers of prose and observation are you likely to have to fitly adorn the work The Hobbit is at one level simply a charming adventure story perhaps one of the most charming and most adventurous ever told There see how simple that was If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable At some level there is little more to say Enjoy the story as the simple entertainment it was meant to be Read it to your children and luxuriate in the excitement and joy that shines from their faces Thats enoughBut if it was only simple entertainment I do not think that it would be anything more than just a good book Instead this simple childrens story resonates and fascinates It teases and hints at something larger and grander and it instructs and lectures as from one of the most subtle intellects without ever feeling like it is instructing lecturing or being condescendingAt its heart the complaint I opened the review with is just a variation on one of the many nuanced observations Tolkien makes in The Hobbit when he complains that a story of a good time is always too quickly told but a story of evil times often requires a great many words to cover the events thereof How often has that idea fascinated meConsider also how the story opens with Bilbos breezy unreflective manners which are polite in form but not in spirit and Gandalfs continual meditation on the meaning of Good morning How much insight is concealed within Gandalfs gentle humor How often do we find ourselves like Bilbo saying something we dont really mean and using words to mean something very unlike their plain meaning How often do we find ourselves saying I dont mean to be rude but when in fact we mean I very much mean to be rude and here it comes If we did not mean to be rude surely we wouldnt say what we say Instead we mean Im going to be rude but I dont want you to think Im someone who is normally rude or Im going to put myself forward but I dont want you to think of me as someone who is normally so arrogant or even Im going to be rude but I dont want to think of myself as someone who is rude so Im going to pretend Im not being rudeI think that is what makes this more than just a good book but a great one Tolkien is able to gently skewer us for our all too human failings and he does so without adopting any of the cynicism or selfloathing so common with those that seek out to skewer humanity for its so evident failings We fantasize about heroes which are strong and comely of form and we have for as long as weve had recorded literature Our comic books are filled with those neopagan mythic heroes whose exaggerated human virtues always amount to whatever else may be true of them beats people up good These modern Ajaxs Helens and Achilles dominate the box office and I would imagine dominate our internal most private fantasy lives as well Oh sure the superhero of our fantasy might have superhuman ethics to go along with his superhuman ability to kick butt attract the opposite sex and enforce their will upon others but it is always attached to and ultimately secondary to our fantasy of power and virility How different is Tolkiens protagonist from Heracles Lancelot Beowulf or Batman  short small mundane and weak Of all the principal characters of the story he possesses probably the least of that quintessential heroic attribute  martial prowessAnd yet he is not actually merely an average Joe Bilbo is just as much an exaggerated idealized hero as Heracles its just that those attributes in which Bilbo is almost transcendently inhuman isnt the sort of attributes we normally fantasize about having ourselves Bilbo is gentle He is simple He is humble Power and wealth have little attraction for him He is kind He takes less than his share and that that he takes he gives away He is a peacemaker Though wrongly imprisoned he bears no grudge and desires no vengeance for the wrongs done to him Rather he apologizes for stealing food and offers to repay in recompense far more than he took Though mistreated he harbors no enmity He never puts himself forward but he never shirks when others do How often do we fantasize about being this different sort of hero and yet how much better we would be if we did How much better off would we be if we like Thorin could declare in our hearts There is more in you of good than you know child of the kindly West Some courage and some wisdom blended in measure If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world How often is it that we hunger after all the wrong things What profit would we really have if we had in great measure the power to beat people up good What real use could we put it too How much better off would we be individually and as a people if we most desired to be graced with Bilbos virtues rather than Achilles speed strength and skill with arms How much less mature does this mere childrens book of a well litworld cause our darker fantasies to seemNow I admit I am biased in my review I read this book  times before the age of  I broke the spines of three copies of it with continual reading Yet in my defense I will say that Im considered only a moderate fan of the book by many Ive known several devotees of the book who like the protagonist of Bradburys Fahrenheit  can recite whole chapters from memory  ensuring that this would be one of the few books that would survive the sudden destruction of all the worlds technology if only the worlds story tellers survived If you are inclined to think no book can be that good and that my review overhypes it so much the better Go in with low expectations so as to be certain that they will be met or exceeded Forget all I have said save that If you havent read it you should because it is quite enjoyable   There are some days when I actually think that the humble Hobbit is superior to its bohemoth brother    Its a much tighter story and Bilbo is a much more appeal character than is Frodo I also just love this poem from The HobbitFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo seek the pale enchanted goldThe dwarves of yore made mighty spellsWhile hammers fell like ringing bellsIn places deep where dark things sleepIn hollow halls beneath the fellsFor ancient king and elvish lordThere many a gleaming golden hoardThey shaped and wrought and light they caughtTo hide in gems on hilt of swordOn silver necklaces they strungThe flowering stars on crowns they hungThe dragonfire in twisted wireThey meshed the light of moon and sunFar over the misty mountains coldTo dungeons deep and caverns oldWe must away ere break of dayTo claim our longforgotten goldGoblets they carved there for themselvesAnd harps of gold where no man delvesThere lay they long and many a songWas sung unheard by men or elvesThe pines were roaring on the heightThe winds were moaning in the nightThe fire was red it flaming spreadThe trees like torches blazed with lightThe bells were ringing in the daleAnd men looked up with faces paleThe dragons ire more fierce that fireLaid low their towers and houses frailThe mountain smoked beneath the moonThe dwarves they heard the tramp of doomThey fled their hall to dying fallBeaneath his feet beneath the moonFar over the misty mountains grimTo dungeons deep and caverns dimWe must away ere break of dayTo win our harps and gold from him   From a hole in the ground came one of my favorite characters of all time the very reluctant and unassuming hero Bilbo Baggins As a child The Hobbit sparked my young imagination causing wonderful daydreams and horrible nightmares As a teen the book made me want to become a writer of fantastical talesor go shoeless live in a hole and smoke a pipe As an adult Tolkiens novel maintains within me a link to my childhood safekeeping cherished memories and evoking everlasting emotions The troubles with trolls those slinking spiders the finding of treasure cave exploration riddles in the darkit all added up in me a love for adventure I would make many an ornate wooden sword in my fathers basement workshop because of Sting Funny I didnt take to wearing rings thoughBeing pintsized Mr Baggins makes the perfect magnetic character for a young person He is about a childs size yet he is mature Similar yet something to aspire to His diminutive stature made his implausible escapes and victories that much more satisfying Nothing bores me more than musclebound killing machines wielding swords the size of windmill blades I have read this fantastic tale a number of times watched the s cartoon movie version countless times and was counting down the days with unabashed eagerness until Peter Jacksons new live action film came out I will continue to read The Hobbit again and again for the road goes ever ever onAppendixish type reviewsThe Hobbit the  animated film version by Rankin  BassThis may be the movie Ive watched the most in my life This is the one I can quote from start to finish and annoy the fuck out of my friends I try to refrain but when John Huston bellows out I am Gandalf and Gandalf means MEwell I just cant help myself Crazyoffhisrocker Brother Theodore as Gollum still astounds me with the sheer depth of his guttural growl Sorry voicestraining Serkis but this is the real Gollum the creepy muthah that kept me up nights Though Rankin  Basss version skips over the whole Beorn scene entirely coming in at  minutes they actually managed to pack in quite a bit of story Certainly it is truncated to absurdity during The Battle of Five Armies but at least its not overblown as appears to be happening with Peter Jacksons unnecessarily long trilogy of this single book The Hobbit or There And Back Again An illustrated book by Rankin  BassThough its a few pages shorter than the regular paperback version this marvelous parttext partillustrated version seems to be unabridged It includes screenshots taken directly from the s cartoon plus where the movie skipped over parts of the book theyve included extra illustrations admittedly of mixed quality Its a little strange to see the same characters rendered differently sitting side by sidebut nonetheless its always fun to see how artists interpret the work especially when its a work dear to your heartThe Hobbit a film version by Peter JacksonIts never fun to see an artist tear the heart out of a work Peter Jackson was given too long a leash when New Line stretched this one book out to three separate movies Instead of one movie packed with awesome we get three that so far Ive yet to see the third and Im not eager to have been watered down and dragged out Extra scenes are added and add nothing Really a sleigh ride chase scene with an incredibly minor character And honestly can Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield act with any other part of his body besides his eyebrows   EDIT  Ive just about had it with people trying to change my mind on every Tolkien review Ive written Please dont comment if youre going to complain Im glad you enjoy his work but Ive given him more than a fair try and I simply dont like his storytelling I am actually allowed to feel that way no matter how scandalous you find that idea Thank you  To be fair it really is a cool story Mr Tolkiens imagination is endless and I respect him immensely for that To be able to conjure a whole new magical world and all these creatures in it absolutely amazing But it is also a very longwinded story and I found myself struggling to get the job done Reading is not supposed to be a job its supposed to be fun and relaxing For me The Hobbit was not an engaging story  I was distracted constantly and kept missing paragraphs The story in itself is pretty great but the way it is told makes the magic disappear I am not quite sure how to explain Maybe it was the way it was written or the fact that they take a long time before anything happens I should also mention the highly anticlimactic end of Smaug and the fact that I cant tell any of the dwarves apart And the songs Dear Merlin the songs I felt like I was in a ruddy musicalIm sad that I didnt like it as much I wish I did In any case still a cool story bro   Maybe one day soon Ill write a proper review of The HobbitIn the meantime I want to say thisIf you are a child you need to read this for Gollums riddlesIf you are an adult you need to read this book to children if you dont have children rent borrow some for at least one opportunity to roleplay GollumBecuz       Click on the link to see a hilarious videoOf course the most compelling reason to add this to your reading list in haste is that its coming to the MOOVIEZZZ Update commentary on the moviez belowBtw if you like kickass fighting elves not to mention pretty kickass sheelves and some sizzling elfdwarf romancewell then you might like the second Hobbit movie more than the book ahemPart  coming to a cinema house near you soonish My PRECCIOOOUUSSSSSand soon Ill have a copy of the all the moviez and they will be me MINE all mine just like my precciousss illustrated copies of the novelHa you didnt think one copy would be enough did youIf you get around used bookstores a lot do look out for an illustrated version of the bookUpdate About the  films by Peter Jackson I didnt find the first  films very memorable He seemed to draw it out almost unbearably and it also felt to me as if he was embellishing the original story a bit The whole thing seemed like actiony rubbish though I personally actually quite enjoyed the swinging shooting swordfighting ninja elves and the bit of romanceBut the THIRD film The Battle of the Five Armies  now that was a good one I almost missed it on the big screen because of the mediocrity of the first two films But I was glad oh so glad that I actually did go and see it The cinematics acting and editing was all very well done but it was the screenwriting and directing that really shone Here we saw a story of courage and cowardice of generosity of greed and avarice of greatness of soul and of smallness of soul of love of selflessness of brotherhood of hatred of humanity of pain of sacrifice of struggle of moral and spiritual victories of sadness and loss but above all of triumph of the soulYes The Battle of the Five Armies  is certainly something that does Tolkien justice at the very least and what a joy it was to behold on the big screen PS The movies also taught us that dwarves CAN be hot   "},

"text": "Sent to a boarding school in Ancelstierre as a young child Sabriel has had little experience with the random power of Free Magic or the Dead who refuse to stay dead in the Old Kingdom But during her final semester her father the Abhorsen goes missing and Sabriel knows she must enter the Old Kingdom to find him With Sabriel the first installment in the Abhorsen trilogy Garth Nix exploded onto the fantasy scene as a rising star in a novel that takes readers to a world where the line between the living and the dead isnt always clearand sometimes disappears altogether I picked this book up from the library and noticed stickers on the book declaring that it was part of a reading challenge here in NSW for grades This book is acceptable to read for  year olds Fuck me can we turn around and go back to the library I asked my husbandHe shook his head and smiled at me Just try it You never knowIts for twelvetothirteen year olds No sex No swearing Minimum violence I dont fucking think soIn the end we brought it home and I sulked the whole way However yesterday I opened it up and thought Id actually give it a try and Im really glad it didIt actually managed to have more romance in it than Darkfever did and that bloody book has NAKED people on the front cover for crying out loudI thought this was going to be a story about a young girl on a magical adventure with a sword and a bad hairdo But it turns out its about an eighteen year old woman with dark deadly skills being chased and hunted by a terrible and deadly enemySabriel has a good clear head on her shoulder Shes smart shes strong shes a wellbalanced and interesting character The characters in Sabriel are all interesting and capturing in their way Mogget was just pure win He cracked me up Touchstone was annoying at first but quickly won me overThe world is interesting and complex filled with enough creepy things that go bump in the night to really freak me outThats the best thing about this book Its not TRYING to be a childrens book The rising action climax and VERY short denouement had me on the edge of my seat I was actually on the edge of my seat throughout most of the bookIn some parts its really freaky and quite scary in other parts its sadThis is the second male author Ive come across lately that has written female characters BETTER than the women have been writing them lately You cant even compare Sabriel to a character like Bella Unless you were to really dumb it down into this Bella  sucks Sabriel  awesome beyond all beliefGive this book a go It was fun scary action packed and I absolutely cant wait to read the sequels   This book really should have been exciting but I actually would have had a much better time had I just blared Monster Mash from my stereo and danced around like a zombie with chicken skin pasted to my face  I feel like this was probably really cool in the s and if I had read it then as my preHarry Potter  year old self I probably would have loved it But now my brain has descended into different forms of oblivion and I laugh voraciously at danger  Ah shiznit  I just used a Disney movie to demonstrate how grown up I am Not to mention I said shiznitIm going to give you my bored face halfhearted summary because the story is way to convoluted to go into much depth without lulling myself into a comaSabriel is told from the third person perspective of a young girl named Sabriel what a coinkydink a necromancer whose father disappears into the realm of the dead She tasks herself with going to retrieve him because she believes hes still alive Blah blah Monster monster Magic magicOur heroine Sabriel who I probably would have thought was the kissass queen of kickass when i was younger seems to know exactly what to do all the time without any internal dialogue insight or even advice Not to mention  training How did she know all this stuff Because she was destined to become the Abhorsen Maybe that would have worked for me when I was young naive and believed that I was going to marry Han Solo But now I need to see the character work and earn the right to their abilities I need to see them struggle and angst over it like young Harryimage errorThe overall tone of the book was chilling And I think if I was younger I would have been thrilled and frightened during this book but now it just didnt phase me I wasnt even all that interested I just felt kinda meh about the whole thingAction scenes abound in the book however every single one felt completely contrived and many were repetitive Sabriel meandered about with unclear goals and even more unclear talents It wasnt easy to distinguish her allies from her enemies but I didnt get the impression that this was done out of poetic symbolism merely from indistinct plotlines and story progression I wasnt captivated by much of anything in this book Although I did like the cat MoggetOh and Im saying its slow even though I was listening to it in audio Usually I can tolerate slower books in audio form but this one really left a lot to be desiredThe narrator was very good at distinct voices for each character but some of them namely the monsters were unbearable with gasping and hissing and gurgling He also has a teensy bit of a pretentious tone which is understandable since he is the illustrious Tim Curry of The Rocky Horror Picture Show But sometimes it became annoyingThe writing was good The worldbuilding was good The narration was good but I never felt invested I wasnt blown away or engaged in the story or characters I was majorly bored And it was loooooongThe scale of the book is huge though If you love sweeping epic fantasies that offer destiny as a solution to every problem with nothing to back it up which lets face it is alot of fantasy then youd probably love thisI really do think that this would be great for a younger audience I think it was good just absolutelywrong for me at this age And if Im being completely honest I would much rather do the Monster Mash  times than go through this again   I shall write a wee bit about my thoughts on this book as I read for I do not trust my foggy brain to keep up with them if I wait until the last minuteI like the juxtaposition of th Century early Ancelstierre with a medievalesque world of the Old Kingdom It threw me for a loop at first how the prologue was very medieval preIndustrial and the first chapter was modernesque I was thinking are they immortal or something But further reading clears that upI dont read as much pure fantasy which I am working on changing but this magic system stands out to me The Charter concept The magic system is based on sketching out these symbols that have a magical power behind them They can also be whistled or sung if bells are not available There are some geniuinely creepy elements that make this story borderline horrific if not dark fantasy in tone There were moments that held me breathless my stomach tight with dread I like the manner in which Nix incorporates zombies Zombies are not a favorite horror element of mine But this type of zombie is scary because the emphasis is on the dark spiritual if you will aspects The ability of dark Charter mages to command spirits to come back from the realms of the Dead binding them in service Dark stuff The loss of free will is a big sticking point with me Nix succeeds in unnerving me in a deeper way and doesnt focus on the gory squeamish aspects of zombies that repel rather than cause the fear responseThe authors ability to describe and propel the narrative without being too dense I like a more natural simplistic form of prose when Im reading That is what has kept me from starting some of the magic fantasy sagas thus farThe welcome elements of subtle humor Mogget is a spirit in the form of a cat He could not be more feline in personality I love this sceneMogget had no time for such introspection mourning or pangs of responsibility He left her watching blankeyed for no more than minute before padding forward and delicately inserting his claws in Sabriels slippered footThats exactly what one of my cats would do to get my attention HahaSo far Im enjoying this read I didnt even turn on my computer and get on Goodreads last night I just read my book And I turned off the tv to better concentrateThats it for nowUpdate Okay I finished this book after am this morning I loved it It was intense it was moving it was written in a manner that allowed the story to flow but with a richness of detail that made it visually stunning as I read The magic was fascinating Intricate but written so that the reader doesnt feel cluelessI absolutely loved Sabriel Shes a strong girl She went through such a harrowing experience I mean there are some truly dark moments in this story Her father must have been so proud of her I know I was Although the book doesnt really show Sabriel with her father the present Abhorsen a person who sends the restless dead back where they belong all that much I loved the relationship between the two A rich fatherdaughter relationship always appeals in a story and I think readers of a similar mind will enjoy this part of the bookFor many years I didnt read fantasy I am sad about that and resolved to make up for lost time Urban fantasy and paranormal romance rekindled my childhood love of this genre This book has truly lit me on fire to read more fantasy I was drawn to the heroism but also the ambiguity of this world where the power of magic has the power to corrupt those who are not strong of mind and spirit Im drawn to a story where the heroine is on a journey that tests her spirit and she comes out of it a stronger wiser person Sabriel definitely fits the bill for that kind of storyAlthough Sabriel is the major focus of this story I felt that Mogget and Touchstone were strong characters that added to the texture of this story The light romantic elements between Sabriel and Touchstone were more than welcomeSabriel was a vivid captivating often scary introduction to the Abhorsen series and my first read by Garth Nix It will not be my last   Possibly one of the greatest fantasy adventures of our times Garth Nixs first novel is a lush magical darkwitty adventure about a young womans battle with the hideous DeadThe story starts with a flashback in which a special necromancer named Abhorsen saves his baby daughter Sabriel from a creature called Kerrigor in the spiritual river of death Many years later at an Englishesque boarding school Sabriel must take up her fathers magical sword and bells and try to find out what has happened to him To do so she must leave her relatively hightech home for the Old Kingdom where magic rules and evil things are stalking herAlong the way she is accompanied by the guard Touchstone and the menacingfunny catspirit Mogget They must try to defeat the evil Kerrigor who wants to blast the Charter which keeps all things from descending into evilSabriel is the best fantasy hero Ive read about since Lord of the Rings Too many fantasy heroines are either damsels or warrior womenSabriel is neither She acts and thinks precisely like a young woman in her position Strong intriguing and no slack with a sword in a bad situation she is a wonderful role modelTouchstone is a darling but Mogget really is unique Is he evil Good Or some peculiar mix This ancient spirit forced to live as a cat is enslaved to the Abhorsen family for the good of everyone we get a glimpse of how dangerous he is The world that Garth Nix dreamed up a mixture of Tolkien and WW England is unparalleled in the fantasy genre Its populated by animated ghouls ghastly Mordicants the almosthuman sendings Charter ghosts the inhabitants of the river of Death where only Abhorsens go and so onHis writing style is lush and hypnoticyou can actually see the events unfolding in front of your eyes in this wintry but inviting world    When an otherworldly visitor tells Sabriel that her father has been trapped in the world of the dead she has no choice but to leave her students life in Ancelstierre and venture into the Old Kingdom to save him There in her fathers absence she must take up the mantle of Abhorsen a necromancer charged with making sure that the dead stay dead Although she does not believe herself to be up to the task Sabriel must make the journey with only a mysterious talking cat named Mogget and a reawakened amnesiac guardsman Touchstone by her sideGarth Nix is easily my favorite YA fantasy author of the moment and one of my favorite authors full stop Sabriel made him popular and respected among fans of the genre and I can see whyIts a brilliant fastpaced book that is quite impossible to put down This means a lot coming from someone like me with an average attention span of  pages or less It has a solid plot realistic characters and a unique world built so seamlessly its entirely believableGarth Nix is a good world builder in that he lays down the foundation of a brandnew world and lets the fantastic details seep through not by longwinded infodumps but by winding them so neatly through the narrative that you hardly notice what hes doing The world and magic of the Old Kingdom is unlike many magic systems Ive come across and its great how he never once spends more than two pages to explain things away Of course this means that a number of things are left unexplored but I suppose since there are two more books in the series theres still time to explore them thereHis characters are also some of the most human I have ever come across Sabriel and Touchstone are competent as heroine and hero but are flawed enough to be interesting without ever falling into the emo or whiny and melodramatic pits that adolescent characters are wont to do in this genre For all the strangeness of the world they live in the characters are as real as can be and the relationship between Sabriel and Touchstone develops with taste and subtlety Most admirable is how Sabriel is portrayed as a normal girl with normal concerns rather than either a weeping confused damsel or an overly masculinized is that a word warrior woman Also she doesnt dissolve into a spineless sexobsessed sap when presented with a boy despite clearly having the usual anxieties and feelings in that regard She proves to be a quickwitted heroine and Garth Nix doesnt cheapen her character and throws her into some really awesome breathtaking conflictsAs a last note although this is the first book of a trilogy its a solid story all on its own so you can pick it up with no worries as to whether you should complete the series or not   "},

"author": "Raymond E Feist",
"text": "To the forest on the shore of the Kingdom of the Isles the orphan Pug came to study with the master magician Kulgan His courage won him a place at court and the heart of a lovely Princess but he was ill at ease with normal wizardry Yet his strange magic may save two worlds from dark beings who opened spacetime to renew the ageold battle between Order and Chaos Earlier this year I got back into the fantasy genre by reading Patrick Rothfuss The Name of the Wind Since then Ive been reading backwards finding the authors Rothfuss was favorably compared to and reading their books I was very taken with the author I read next George R R Martin and would happily have continued the Song of Fire and Ice series but apparently the next book in that series has been postponed till  So I chose Raymond Feist who was next on my list To a total fantasy virgin it may hold some appeal but even the books I read at the peak of my dorkiness at a time when I read almost nothing except books by RA Salvatore and others published by Forgotten Realms are significantly better than this book Simply put Magician Apprentice lacks the subtlety beauty and complexity of the other works of fantasy or even plain old fiction Ive read this year Overall Id say it reads like the collected notes of what were probably very engaging DD styled scenarios and RPG adventures The characters are perhaps overloved by the author All are sort of generic nice guys thrown into tough situations They lack flaws they have no weaknesses and so they dont broaden as characters Theyre chivalrous and handsome When they fail rarely its through no fault of their own All personal conflicts are resolved with a good cry some laughter and then drinks The most major change in a character is enacted not by learning from experience or harsh reality or personal introspection but instead by donning mysterious magical armor None of the characters face more than brief moral or ethical dilemmas Because these men are only faced with deus ex machina type problems their growth is never shown were merely told its happened after random narrative leaps Four months has passed and generic male hero  wishes to return home or  years have passed and generic male  is now battle hardened Okay I guess if you say so The females are even more one dimensional All those given more than one line of dialog are beautiful playful strongwilled and eager to find a partner Even the elven Queen is essentially the same she just has a title Leaving aside for a moment the other worldly opposition the only villains are mentioned in passing None are full characters just useful tools to create minor shifts in the action The opposition from another world are the most interesting but unfortunately much of the consideration and description of them is repetitious They have different notions of honor theyre fearless they speak a tonal language they come from a world without metal and employ a magic beyond the understanding Midkemians Those basic points are hammered home over and over again Over and over again is one of the main problems of this book So much feels like repetition of the same fight the same history and the same description I read the authors preferred text or edition or some such nonsense Having not read the original I cant be sure but Im sure that with  pages trimmed while many of my complaints about the characters would be the same at the very least the plot would move that much fasterI also read Magician Master which I wont bother reviewing but is a slight improvement Id probably give it two stars The description and consideration of the Kelewan world its people and their customs is far more interesting than anything in the first book but the writing and characters still feel tired and one dimensional   Magician Apprentice is an appealing introduction into an epic fantasy series that a newbie can enjoy It offers a young hero who is just at the beginning of his journey to find his purpose in life Feist offers a fantasy world on the brink of war from a threat that has the capacity to bring great change to Midkemia as they know it While the world has a typical medievaltype feel the variety of races presented give the world an incredible texture I loved the descriptions of the elves and their way of life how they are similar and different from the Dark Brotherhood Elves who have fallen into a darker way of life I have to say that the dwarves really caught my attention Their beliefs values and their skill at fighting and navigating the mines of the Stone Mountains Of course loved the dragonI wasnt sure about the Tsurani storyline initially but it takes this story in a different direction from what I initially expected It sets up an incredible culture clash that takes this novel to a wider focus as the Midkemians have to work together to stave off the invasion of forces from another worldInitially it seems that Pug our young magician apprentice is the center of this story But it becomes clear that various characters gain the focus of Feist Starting out like a coming of age story and I suppose it continues to be one in some way this story becomes one about people dealing with their world being invaded by a formidable group of people whose values are completely alien to their own and who seem invincibleOne detractor Id have for this story is that its not a standalone The story doesnt end on an obvious cliffhanger but you definitely have to keep reading to find out what happens to all the pivotal characters With a massively overflowing to read list I am not eager for too many series to add but the strength of the story and the good writing here guarantees I will be back for moreFantasy Beginner Rating    I first read this book shortly after it came out in the early s while in my s Its every bit as enjoyable on the th read almost  years later In many ways it is a very typical fantasy but the characters pop very well  the world has enough new elements to make it quite intriguing The quick pace hides a complexity that becomes apparent as the story progresses  were led deeper into the world Since I have a towering TBR pile I reread sparingly Im so happy I did this againOn to Magician Master In the HB  UK editions these are published as one volume I prefer PBs  am glad the two were split Unlike the Jordan bricks these PBs have withstood the test of time due to their reasonable size   Started out well I liked the main character it seemed like it might be interesting Then they walked into the mines of Moria visited Galadriel in Lothlorien but he renamed them all cuz hes smart like that and the main character disappeared halfway through the narrativeThe characters were flat as cardboard particularly the females and he spent most of his time telling rather than showing Eventually the main character shows up in the second half of this book which was published as MagicianMaster By that time hes utterly useless except as a plot device boring self important and overall I wished he had stayed kidnappedBasically it was a load of derivative and nighunmitigated crap and I cant believe I actually read the sequel to this What was I thinking   I wanted to like this book I really did First a major caveat The Magician Apprentice is only one part of a twovolume novel The second volume The Magician Master completes the tale Given this it isnt really fair to judge the first volume on many points so keep in mind that my review applies almost exclusively to this first volumeThe Magician Apprentice is a story centered on  you guessed it  a magicians apprentice named Pug who finds himself an unlikely hero when the world of Midkemia is invaded by the Tsurani from another dimension Unfortunately the whole thing sounds more exciting than it really is First of all I found myself perpetually annoyed that our hero was named Pug It kept conjuring images of a dogfaced boy with bugeyes The name is cute in a way that distracted me from believing that he could ever become anything more than a pubescent putz Furthermore Pugs character is thin and cliche Fiest provides plenty of narration but Pug performs so few characterdefining actions and has so few lines of dialogue that he remains a mystery Rather than being a participant I often felt as though the story were happening to himSadly Kulgan the magician to whom Pug is apprenticed is your stereotypical fantasy magician he is tempermental wears long robes and a funny hat sports a long white beard and puffs away on a pipe That isnt to say that a fantasy magician shouldnt appear this way its just that this is all I know of Kulgan He too is flat and boringI really liked the concept of the apprentice magician It reminds me of Luke Skywalker apprenticing with Obi Wan and Yoda But we never really see Pug do any apprenticing He becomes an apprentice reads a lot and thats pretty much it In fact we dont see him doing much other than being conflicted over the Dukes daughter which frankly I thought was lame I picked up a book called The Magician not An Average Awkward Fourteen Year Old Boy Discovers GirlsWe also never get to see a scene like the one in which Skywalker observes the master at work such as Obi Wans Jedi mind tricks  These arent the droids youre looking for  or Yoda lifting the XWing from the swamp on Dagobah We never see Kulgan do anything interesting with magic so we really dont have any idea what Pug is shooting forThere are also problems with the plot itself First I have read some of it before in a little tale called The Lord of the Rings You may have heard of it Feists world is so Tolkienesque that it gives me heartburn Take for example the trek through the mines You know the mines dug out by the dwarves who dared to delve deeper than was safe So deep in fact that there are unnamed evils lurking there No Im not talking about the mines of Moria Im talking about the mines of Mac Mordian Cadal Yeah even the name is somewhat familiar This is a setting too associated with the The Lord of the Rings to work well anywhere else Moria is a place that truly scared me but the mines of Mac Mordian Cadal make me feel like an adult walking through a Disneyland version of Moria To be fair the first three quarters of The Magician Apprentice are almost an unnecessary part of the story These chapters serve to introduce a variety of characters and place them in position for the inevitable Tsurani invasion After the invasion however the story finally loses its Tolkiensque flavor and begins to take on a life of its ownFeist fails to consistently pace his story we jump from We have been invaded to The war has been going on now for a year and now were tired Youre telling me that all the excitement surrounding an invasion from another dimension is going to be frittered away like Adam Sandlers life was fastforwarded in Click WTF I want to be where the fighting is not in some drawing room talking about strategy a whole year after the war has startedFeist also has trouble with perspective At first we think were in third person limited but Feist frequently hops into third person omniscient On more than one occasion he switches perspective midscene with no line breaks or visual cues This drives me up the wall There is nothing more annoying than being in Pugs head one moment and then hopping over to Kulgan and then back to Pug It is enough to make a reader go crosseyed Furthermore when were supposed to be in Pugs perspective Feist insists on telling us things that he cant possibly know The narrators voice creeps into the story and I find myself wanting to slam the door in his face and tell him to get the hell outOverall I found myself trudging through this book Although I think the concept of the rift is genius Feist failed to bring it to fruition I cant help but think that Feists editor should have rapped him on the knuckles with this manuscript It never should have left the editors desk looking like this Once I hit a point when I realized that the story had jumped two years ahead in time I nearly gave up Massive temporal shifts like that are tough to pull off but they are made even more difficult when the reader doesnt give a damn about the charactersHaving started reading the second volume I can say that much is improved Feist has finally managed to bring Pug into focus and  despite its flaws  I am honestly looking forward to continuing the story   "},

book the way I didYou have to be in the sixth grade a freakishly precocious reader whose beloved sixthgrade teacher brings a box of her ten favorite books to class and sets them up on the chalkboard and leaves them there for weeks for you to look at including one HUGE book that looks like its a billion pages long with some cool fairy priestess chick on a horse on the coverYou have to have grown up reading King Arthur stories and LOVE the movie The Sword In the StoneYou have to be so hopelessly nerdy that you would rather sit on the side of the playground reading than play kickball never mind how much the other kids make fun of you about itYou have to be Catholic enough to understand the mentality of the occasionally hateful Christian characters in the book as well as to be baffled and perplexed by all the sexuality which will make a number of plot elements only make sense to you when you reread the book as a college student and go Ohhhhh Now I get itYou have to be the kind of girl who loves and relates to the plain outcast Morgaine who is treated as a freak has to learn how to rely on herself alone You have to hate the shallow blonde princesses even when they seem like they might be kind of nice people and always root for the feisty brunette You have to be a fantasy geek who LOVES any book with swordfighting magic princesses and doomed romance You have to be patient enough to read  pages that cover one womans entire lifetime from before her birth to old old ageYou have to come to the end of the book and secretly wish that despite your religious conviction in your Catholic upbringing Britain had never been Christianized and we were all still witches You have to secretly wish you belonged to a mystical female cult where you had to have a blue crescent moon tattooed on your foreheadYou have to wish you knew how to ride a horse in a dress and look majestic instead of falling off every time you were forced onto a horse at camp or on vacation and now you hate them and they scare you    OK I admit when I told my college Arthurian Lit professor that Id read and enjoyed this book he proceeded to give me a quickbeforethenextclasscomesin lecture about how Marion Zimmer Bradleys interpretation skewed wildly from the genreBut I dont care Its a difficult book long and utterly depressing but it takes the first indepth look at both women and the pagan Celtic religion of Britain which Christianity usurped around that time Evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay is transfered into multifaceted Morgaine a woman deeply committed to her family especially her aunt Viviane halfbrother Arthur and cousin Lancelet Gwenhyfar the simpering Christian princess was my least favorite but even she had some complexity an unhappy childhood inferiority complex made worse by her bareness and obvious jealousyissues with Morgaine concerning the womens relationships with Arthur and Lancelet Perhaps the most dour of Morgaines familial ties is that with her son Mordred the illigitimate heir of her brother whom she foolishly put up with her aunt Morgause easily the most shallow and greedy woman in the entire bookReligionwise I found it impossible not to root for Morgaines Avalon not only because I knew it was destined to recede into the mists but because it was matriarchal and so much more comforting to me than the expansionalist narrowminded and mysoginistic version of Christianity prevalent during those times At the end Morgaine herslf shows the most tolerance and versatility for diverse cultures she outlives most everyone else and grows to accept that her mother goddess is now worshipped as the virgin mary Quite the contrast from the cronelike Morgan Le Fay whose only purpose is to destroy the kingdom of Camelot   The Arthur myth from the point of view of Morgaine le Fay pagan priestess Supposedly a feminist take on the old legends There is one main problem with this approach lets face it womens lives in the dark ages were pretty boring And rather than break out of this mold with strong female characters Bradley talks a lot about spinning weaving and having babies The female characters are either contemptible or irritating or both The male characters are cardboardArthur is as heroic as a limp dishrag Merlin just an old man sitting in his rocking chair The paganChristian thing is overwrought and shrill devolving mostly into interminable theological debates between characters that cover the same ground over and over and over againA lot of things irritated me about this book but nothing more than the simple lack of a compelling narrative construction Nothing happens There is dialogue which mostly rehashes things that were already talked about And then there is monologue in which the weak and mostly contemptible characters thrash around in their heads so much that it would make Dostoyevsky cringe It makes me angry that you could even try to tell the Arthurian legendeven from a feminine point of viewwithout looking at the epic clashes between the knights of the round table and their enemiesHorrendously disappointing For a fantasy novel George RR Martins A Game of Thrones does everything that this book tries to do and does it ten times better For more of a historical view Bernard Cornwells The Last Kingdom is a much more fun and interesting look at the clash of Christian and pagan civilizations and even has characters that you dont hate    Good lord I havent ever hated a book as much as this oneI picked up The Mists of Avalon because I really love Nordic myths and usually any stories about King Arthur Everyone seems to adore this book even my librarian told me that this was a really good Arthurian tale Well its not Its horribleFirst let me say how turned off I was by all the bashing and hating there was of Christianity And Im saying this as the atheist that I am I dont believe in God yet that doesnt mean I am not bothered by the unnecessary and often narrowminded and uneducated hate towards a religion Thats all there was in the first  pages and it was a very recurring theme throughout the book As if having one stupid priest wasnt enough the authur just had to fit in several more and call each stupider than the previousYeah there were dumbevil priests and followers of that religion but there will always be bad people who call themselves followers of a religion However that doesnt mean the religion is outright evil okay There were dumber than sht Christians Jews Muslims atheists and whatnot and there always will be But you cant call a whole sect bad based on its worst people If you did that then you might as well hate the entire human race and live in a hole the rest of your life because there are some really evilidiotic people out there And all this blabbering about stupid mean cowardly priests did nothing to advance the plot At all I mean if you wanted to write a book in which the antagonists were all evil Christians then youre on the right track but this was supposed to be a book on King Arthur dang it not of your personal hate issues with Christians Personally I really dont like it when authors bring up religions in books that arent nonfiction theologypsychologyhistory works Stuff gets brushed over and embellished to make the book in question seem more interesting and its infuriating what youll read Thats exactly the case with The Mists of Avalon Keep that in mind Marion Zimmer Bradley You can rant to a therapist but dont take it out on a book THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT A WELLLOVED FANTASY TALE Just dont take it out on a book in general Although based on this books rating people loved all the hate on Christians Snort People these days shovel down any garbage given to themWhats worse the author couldnt seem to create a halfway decent female protagonist in all the  pages and the countless women charactersIgraine No Shes a whiney pushover who convinces herself shes in love with a man her husband hates because she hears a prophecy that shes supposed to bear that mans child if I heard a prophecy like that Id run away screaming avoid the guy whos supposed to knock me up and in case he did come near me Id at least have pepper spray handy Okay she didnt love Gorlois but he was good to her up until she started spending time with a man he clearly distrusted and told her to stay away from not that I really like Gorlois but wouldnt you be freaking mad if your wifehusband got all cozy with someone you consider evil And besides stabbing her husband Igraine doesnt do anything She just sits at home Wow my new heroVivianne plotted adultery and incest acted like she loved everyone but in reality did horrible things to them She was even surprised when Galahad who she barely had anything to do with didnt love her Also did anyone else notice how Vivianne always corrected people and told them All gods and goddesses are one and then proceeded to ridicule the Christian God and call him and his followers morons Hah I dont know if that was meant to be funny or if Ms Bradely was just too stupid to notice the contradiction Morgaine failed at everything in life I felt bad for her at being used like that then for being rejected by Lancelet But then again she couldnt care less for her child hated pretty much innocent Gwenhwyfar and came up with plans to have Lancelet sleep with her even though she knew he didnt love her so whatever sympathy I had for her went pretty quick And it gets even better  she gets married sleeps with several more people goes to Avalon again and acts like shes the main goddess even though she did so many ungoddess like things I loved how Niniane thought She should be here in my place the GREAT Morgaine of the Fairies HAH What did Morgaine ever do besides sleep with her own brother Gwenhwyfar was worse than Igraine On the other hand it was so obvious that Bradely created her solely to make fun of Christians She must have been like Oh Ill create this woman whos a dumb little bitch in heat who everyone will hate And bonus Ill mention how beautiful she is every two pages to make sure all the female readers will be jealous of her and hate her even more Then Ill make sure to have her pretend to be a pious follower of Christ even though in reality an adulteress is not a pious follower of Christ and Ill have created a perfect epitome of all Christian women to show the world what nasty morons they are YayI mean really And a lot of people actually agree with this exaggerated biased ridiculous nonsenseWhen I was browsing through star reviews of this book to try and understand why exactly human beings love this trash someone actually said this book makes me want to leave behind my life and become a pagan  That wasnt the exact quote but that was the gist of itI just I cant even Oh yes I can Become a pagan then and have a baby with your own brother at a drunken bonfire Next make sure you neglect your child and run around effing tons of other men By the way back then protection didnt exist so be sure not to use any of that either and see how many STDs and unwanted pregancies youll get Homeless and vulgar isnt Morgaines portrayal of a pagan lifestyle just wonderful Back to the characters  the males were all onedimensional and flat They were all extremely handsome and extremely skilled knights and extremely horny Coughs A little originality please Bradely Maybe divert from your view that all men are chauvinist pigsThe one character I kind of liked was Morgause  shes independent seemed to have a good relationship with her children and kept Morgaines secret But she was so slutty that I stopped rooting for herThere also seemed to be a whole lot of describing boring daytoday activities that just like all the Christian hate did nothing to advance the plot Its like somebody gets up stares in the mirror and thinks about some complicated love web goes downstairs starts knitting talks to an old woman who came in from the cold  pages later something tiny happens that helps the story along Then another good  of the book was made up of describing how beautiful this and this person was and then another person is introduced who is WAY MORE beautiful and so on and so on In Morgaines case it was terrible One minute shes plain then someone calls her beautiful then shes called ugly then shes supposed to have an inner beauty then Morgain does something horrible so I cant see what inner beauty theyre talking about then shes beautiful ugly beautiful uglyLike did the author have bipolar attacks while writing this I honestly dont spend a whole lot of time detailing characters faces Tell me theyre tall redhaired have a scar on their face and thats just perfect Im interested in the plot not the size of everybodys big toes SeriouslyThe writing itself could have been okay but because its subject was crap it was not okay This book was bad it really was After a good  pages I just skimmed another  and then skipped the last part and skimmed the epilogue I honestly could care less what happens Im against book burning but Id probably spray extra kerosene on a stack of The Mists of Avalon copies if I had the chance   There is no such thing as a true tale Truth has many faces and the truth is like to the old road to Avalon it depends on your own will and your own thoughts whither the road will take youAgain I feel the need to put my thoughts down about some of the books that changed my life and made me into the guy I amThose who know me just one tiny bit also know that The Lord of the Rings is my favourite book ever Go a little bit deeper and you also know that Frank Herberts Dune is high up on my list of alltime favourites The point is that those two books were the first real fantasy books using the term loosely here I read in my life But in reality I have a holy trinity of fantasy books from my childhood The three books that made me love fantasy in the first place and go to explore other worlds and the magic between the pages of masterpiecesIve already confessed my undying love for LotR and Dune The third aspect of the trinity is The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer BradleyLike I already wrote about in slightly more detail in my review of    Marion Zimmer Bradley is despite it all one of my favourite authors This book is what introduced me to her worksBut as I write these words I realise one sad fact about this wonderful story I remember nothing of it Not one bit Unlike the other two books mentioned in the beginning I have never read this one again after the first time And now Im scared to actually do it Because I dont want to sully childhood memories with the harshness of realityThe only thing I do remember is that I absolutely loved it And still do passionately so And thats the important part rightSo depending on whether or not I eventually read this again and depending on whether or not I have more thoughts to think and more words to write maybe there will be a full review about the loveliest work of Arthurian fiction at some pointAnd so perhaps the truth winds somewhere between the road to Glastonbury Isle of the Priests and the road to Avalon lost forever in the mists of the Summer Sea   "},
{"title": "The Lies of Locke Lamora",
"isbn": "0553804677",
"author": "Scott Lynch",
"text": "In this stunning debut author Scott Lynch delivers the wonderfully thrilling tale of an audacious criminal and his band of confidence tricksters Set in a fantastic city pulsing with the lives of decadent nobles and daring thieves here is a story of adventure loyalty and survival that is one part Robin Hood one part Oceans Eleven and entirely enthralling An orphans life is harsh  and often short  in the island city of Camorr built on the ruins of a mysterious alien race But born with a quick wit and a gift for thieving Locke Lamora has dodged both death and slavery only to fall into the hands of an eyeless priest known as Chains  a man who is neither blind nor a priestA con artist of extraordinary talent Chains passes his skills on to his carefully selected family of orphans  a group known as the Gentlemen Bastards Under his tutelage Locke grows to lead the Bastards delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr and no wealthy noble is safe from his stingPassing themselves off as petty thieves the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of lightfingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworlds most feared ruler Capa Barsavi But there is someone in the shadows more powerful  and more ambitious  than Locke has yet imagined Known as the Gray King he is slowly killing Capa Barsavis most trusted men  and using Locke as a pawn in his plot to take control of Camorrs underworld With a bloody coup under way threatening to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life Locke vows to beat the Gray King at his own brutal game  or die trying Back when I was first published people made a lot of comparisons between me and Scott Lynch The sentiment was mostly along the lines of Pat Rothfuss is the next Scott Lynch Heres the thing Lies of Lock Lamora had come out almost exactly a year before my first book The Name of the Wind It was Scotts first book the first in a fantasy series The world was gritty and real and it had knocked everyone over with how good it was So I knew it was a flattering comparison but at the time I was kinda irked by it I remember thinking Why do I have to be the next Scott Lynch Why cant I just be the first Pat Rothfuss Ill probably be a lot better at that Ive got way more experience at it if nothing else Years later I finally got around to reading Lies and enjoyed it I saw that it was a clever book and gritty with a cool world And there was an orphan boy in it who was a witty mouthy thief A while after that I met Scott and really liked him as well So I let go of what little residual irritation I had not that there was very much Fast forward to now This last week I started rereading Lies and I was absolutely fucking stunned by how good it is The construction of it The language The world The cleverness The wit There is nothing I dont like in this book Seriously Okay Fine One tiny tiny quibble Even so do you know how rare it is for me to say that Right now in the full flush of this second reading I think Lies is probably in e in my top ten favorite books ever Maybe my top fiveIts not really fair to compare the two books Theyre different styles Different subjects Different worlds That said heres the things that The Lies of Locke Lamora does better than The Name of the Wind  The beginning of his book is stronger than mine Seriously  pages into my book youll have reached the point where someone is starting to actually tell a story  pages into Lies you know the main character and are halfway into a fucking heist  His title is better than mine Dont get me wrong The Name of the Wind is a good title its the right title for my book But The Lies of Lock Lamora thats a faboo title right there And his series title is better than mine too Gentleman Bastard beats Kingkiller Chronicles handsdown  His cussing is better than mine Not in real life In real life I cuss like a sailor But the language in my books is pretty genteel and tame In Lies Lynchs lowlife street thugs are vulgarian virtuosos This might seem like a little thing but its not It builds the world It shows character It helps make the story feel truly perfectly grubby and real Here it is in a nutshell When I was first published I was irritated when people compared me to Scott Lynch Only now do I realize how huge a compliment I was being given If you havent read it you should If you have read it you should probably read it again    Oceans Eleven was great and everything but know what wouldve made it cooler If the setting had been during the late middle ages possibly the Renaissance Better yet a fantasy world version of the Renaissance with an intricate system of magic and a complex set of political conspiracies to add some flair And what if the city was built upon the ruins of an earlier city and the earlier city was built by some enigmatic science fiction creatures that have since disappeared And if instead of a handsome tepid and understated George Clooney in the lead we had a short guy who cant swordfight a whit and has a bit of an anger management issue And he drops unexpected oneliners that make you literally laugh out loud while youre in the breakroom at work and suddenly everyone is looking at you like youre psycho What if the character went to the Mel Gibson school of Masochism requiring he gets beat to a bloody pulp and stabbed and drowned in horse urineoh I dont knowseveral times per story arc How about this character well call him Locke is absolutely fallible and occasionally screws up on a cosmic level The kind of screwup that would get someone less clever killed in mere seconds And what if improbably this protagonist somehow escapes and stillin a manner of speakingwins That sounds like fun But it COULD end up a little predictable So the author should be a recent graduate of the George R R Martin School of Bumping Off Prominent Characters Yes these schools do exist And the con game Locke is building should hit tons of snags that continue raising the stakes and drawing in new more dangerous characters increasing the risk until you just cant stop reading even to put out house fires for the last couple hundred pages And then when somehow the Gentlemen Bastards emerge on the other side coated in their own blood and the blood of others triumphant you put the book down and say Wow Furthermore How about even though the book is the first book in a ridiculously long series this hypothetical book is a complete story For those of you who read a lot of Very Long Fantasy Serieses this may be a foreign concept It may help to wiki the words climax and resolution When you finish this one you arent forced to keep reading in order to find out how the conflict is resolved You actually know That sounds pretty cool Well it is cool It is witty profane violent over the top and frequently hilarious I cant believe this is Scott Lynchs first novel and I cant wait to read more This is an incredibly fun adventure novel Find yourself a copy and read it    With blood deaths betrayals money and drowning in horse urine With a shtload of nonPG humor All for the price of one And its SO GOOD  Warning If you are not a fan of strong language you should back away slowly from this book It gleefully takes the fbombs and casually throws them around But as the author has mentioned before foul language is the least issue of this book full of violence blood and drowning in horse piss Regardless consider yourselves warnedAdd the above together and you have Camorr A Locke Lamora our lovable antihero would like you to believe hes nothing more than a petty thief Well not so much He is the Thorn of Camorr puling one heist after another on the unsuspecting secure in their birth nobles of his medieval Venicelike city Until one day he gets in way over his head There are plenty of people who would love to see him dead  if they could ever figure out who the hell he is    Locke Lamora is a Gentleman Bastard who doesnt care much about becoming rich So why does he steal on a truly grandiose scale Of course    And because he is not a fan of nobles feeling invincible just because they are nobles He loves being a Thorn in their side and giving them the taste of their own medicine   Locke is a proverbial smartass He is stubborn clever and disrespectful Basically he has a knack for attracting trouble After all someone has already paid for his death before Locke even turned eight He is not so great with weapons  unless you count wits sheer tenacity and enormous disrespect for authority What he IS great with is friendship He gets by with a little help from his friends so to say   Locke Lamora has only one BERSERK BUTTON unless you also count a certain redhead     Seriously you dont want Locke Lamora pissed at you view spoilerJust ask the Gray King  And thats what I really adored about this book  the depiction of honest strong friendships between Locke and his gang Formerly a bunch of misfits they have formed strong bonds of friendship that will only be broken by death They always have each others back no matter what the situation is Locke and Jean Tannen have the best bromance ever since Joey and Chandler or Turk and JDI loved this book  so much I want to have grandbabies with it Its a fun fastpaced skillfully written smart and snarky but surprisingly touching read that had me laughing and shaking my fist in anger within a few pages Easy  stars for the enjoyable ride   brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   So I was surprised to discover we owned this book since its a very well known book but nobody in my house had ever mentioned it to meTurns out my wife bought it tried it found it too slow and gave up Ive convinced her to give it another goI enjoyed Locke Lamora and his lies quite a bit Immediately I liked the writing which combines wit with solid prose Like my wife I hit a bit of a soft patch early on though for me it was that I was finding the point of view very surface sharing almost nothing of Lockes thoughts or desires leaving him a bit of a blank Lots of fantasy fans quite like a blank to project themselves onto  but Im not one of them Fortunately Lockes personality continued to develop and the point of view seemed to settle a little deeper into him as things progressedThe real strengths of the book are the plotting the dialogue and the atmosphere The dialogue banter brings the Gentlemen Bastards to life the plotting keeps the reader on their toes and the city is very well imaginedI was surprised to find that the lighthearted tone set primarily by the banter between Lockes gang actually allows a slew of quite dark themesscenes to slide past with less impact than they might have The child prostitution the gruesome torture scenes and the mutilation dealt out by our hero are all absent in my own dbut which is often called out for being very darkIn any event I found it to be a rewarding read well written and entertaining Id recommend any fantasy fan to give it a try   Buddyread with the super sweet Sakina Click to read her review   Locke Lamora   Orphan becomes a Master Con Man   Fucks up along the way   Creatures exist

{"title": "The Silmarillion",
"isbn": "0618391118",
"author": "JRR Tolkien",
"text": "The story of the creation of the world and of the First Age this is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part The three Silmarils were jewels created by Fanor most gifted of the Elves Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth the first Dark Lord Thereafter the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middleearth The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fanor and his kindred against the gods their exile from Valinor and return to Middleearth and their war hopeless despite all their heroism against the great Enemy I had tried to read this book multiple times in the past and had basically given up but I finally realised that I was attempting to read it the wrong way I was trying to read The Silmarillion like I have read and reread LOTR as a story an epic story of course but still a story Now while The Silmarillion is of course partially a story it is at least for me first and foremost a religious type document a biblical mythological account of the Elder Days of Middle Earth So this time I read The Silmarillion the way I used to read my Bible and how I approached Hesiods Theogony and other books on Greek and Roman mythology reading small bits and pieces following along via audiobook at the same time if possible And I know this might sound a bit strange I actually tried singing some of the parts to myself And I will likely have to reread sometime soon because there is no way I am going to be able to keep all of the different names etc clear in my head But for a first full and complete read I can only say wow As good as LOTR but also very different and I honestly believe that in order to truly appreciate savour and enjoy The Silmarillion a different approach and a different method of reading are required it just does not work as a typical novel because it is not a typical novel it is not even a typical epic   Ever since I joined GR Ive been putting off the writing of this books review but since Im high as fuck on cold medicine I feel like I can do it so here suffer thru itAlong long time ago a little rd world kid with an afro became fascinated of what he read on the internet about some British writer named Tolkien he wanted his books it became his obsession so he embarked on a quest to find his books and read the shit out of them but alas The book was no where to be found on his dumb little island but that wasnt going to stop our little afro hero he looked and looked he went to used bookstores he ordered  times in the expensive ones he looked online on the streets even on the flea markets but they were not to be found one day after wating for  hours for his translator to finish translating and Ecopy of The Lord of The Ring The Fellowship of The Ring Into Spanish and realizing that it made no fucking sense once translated our little afro hero went into the internet and founded the only bookstore with most of Tolkiens work on stock in Spanish But there was only one problem the fucking bookstore was in freaking Spain the cost of the books  SH was way more of what our hairy friend had on his piggy bank so he did the unthinkable his parents had been bitching about his afro for months So he proposed to them that in exchange of his fro they should give him the books he wanted and they accepted in an act of self mutilation our fuzzy friend shaved his head to show his parents his anger over making him lose his fro after that the money was given to him he could order now his parents werent as stupid as he always thought and that day That day the curse was born It was like the curse of Feanor but lame the books took an entire year to arrive now imagine our froless hero waiting and waiting and calling and emailing and checking and re checking for a whole mother fucking year with his shaved head for those of you who wonder this is why I will never again buy a book from the internet Im fucking traumatized but when they got there how to put it into words I read the first book  pages in one day the second in  days the third in  days the fourth on a day and a half and then it was time for the Silmarillion I didnt know nothing about the Silmarillion I left it for last cuz I thought it would be the most boring one and boy was I wrong The first part The Music of the Ainur was such a mind blowing experience to me to the point of I cannot talk about anything else but how metal it sounded that my friends started complaining somebody got to the point of threaten me that if said something else about Melkor being the coolest I was going to get punch in the balls I mean if you ever read this book you should know how Melkor invented heavy metal on it then it was the lamps and all the gay stuff that I didnt like thats when I used to think Melkor was the coolest then came The Trees and I was just fascinated of how beautiful everything was I know it sounds mad gay But it was And then Melkor did something that made me stop thinking of him as the coolest he killed The Trees is not like I cried or anything like that but you know that was fuck up The guy is cool and all but I know it sounds stupid but I did like those Trees man  by this time I was so lost in this book that one could actually call it an obsession I was walking while reading talking to the characters if I were to get a penny for every time I told a character on this book turn back you fool Id be rich by now look I dont wanna ruin anything to anybody I could honestly talk for hours about how fucking awesome Feanor is Or how big Fingolfins balls are bigger than Stevens or how beautiful Luthien was and how I wished she never met Beren or how fucking sick and twisted Morgoth gets I mean the man was sick But I need to stop Cuz if I dont Ima be here for ever I wanna say is that Tolkien was the mother fucking greatest of all times man this is just such a beautiful bookeven tho the paper dont agree with me on this it was self mutilation She has no idea how attachedI was to that fro   How To Build A Truly Convincing Fantasy World Its all about the language Make sure your worlds language is convincing and youre pretty much there Conversely if your language sucks then everything else will Your book cant include more than a few sentences in your invented language without losing your audience But it can include plenty of names So what people will really judge you on is the quality of the namesThe rest of this review is available elsewhere the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons    Buddy reread with Ive been contemplating whether or not to tackle the challenge of actually reviewing this masterpiece for quite some time now In the end after having finished reading it for the second time I realised that I should at least throw out my thoughts on it So here we goThis is in my eyes the most impressive book ever writtenNotice how I did not say best That was completely intentional I do not believe it is the best book ever written even though I know others think so and I understand their opinions I also know people who have given up on reading this book or been baffled by the thought of even attempting it And I understand them too This is not the most exciting fantasy book youll find But I stand by it being the most impressive oneAfter almost reluctantly publishing The Hobbit and very reluctantly writing and publishing its sequel The Lord of the Rings Tolkien could finally concentrate on what he actually wanted to do to complete his collection of tales on the mythology and origins of Arda often just referred to as MiddleEarth The result though published after the great man himself had passed away became The SilmarillionOn the back of my little blue timeworn paperback which is almost twice as old as I am I read a little quote from the Guardian review of the original release It says How given little over half a century of work did one man become the creative equivalent of a people And the question more or less summarises my own feelings on this book and Tolkiens other works These three hundred pages have given life to the most impressive achievement of human creativity ever No fantasy author has ever done anything matching this and it is my firm belief that no one ever will The only book The Silmarillion can be compared to is the Bible and I hope I do not offend anyone by saying this even it does not come close to thisThe creation of the World by the songs of the Ainur the schemes of Morgoth Bauglir for dominion over the world the making of the wondrous Silmarils the breeding of great Dragons in the firepits of Angband the story of Beren and Lthien tales of war and betrayal and love and loss and joy and grief and everything you could possibly imagine in a tale of fantasy All of it can be found within the pages of this little bookThis book is not for everyone In fact I would only recommend it to those who have read and loved both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings But I wouldnt hesitate to call it the greatest masterpiece of worldbuilding the fantasy genre has ever hadAll that remains is to refer you to my little collection of quotes and artwork from the most important scenes of the book Most of you have already seen it but for those who havent please have a lookWhen the Valar entered into E they were at first astounded and at a loss for it was as if naught was yet made which they had seen in vision and all was but on point to begin and yet unshaped and it was dark For the Great Music had been but the growth and flowering of thought in the Timeless Halls and the Vision only a foreshowing but now they had entered in at the beginning of Time and the Valar perceived that the World had been but foreshadowed and foresung and they must achieve it So began their great labours in wastes unmeasured and unexplored and in ages uncounted and forgotten until in the Deeps of Time and in the midst of the vast halls of E there came to be that hour and that place where was made the habitation of the Children of IlvatarDark now fell the shadow on Beleriand as is told hereafter but in Angband Morgoth forged for himself a great crown of iron and he called himself King of the World In token of this he set the Silmarils in his crown His hands were burned black by the touch of those hallowed jewels and black they remained ever after nor was he ever free from the pain of the burning and the anger of the painThe one had leaves of dark green that beneath were as shining as silver and from each of his countless flowers a dew of silver light was ever falling and the earth beneath was dappled with the shadows of his fluttering leaves The other bore leaves of a young green like the newopened beech their edges were of glittering gold Flowers swung upon her branches in clusters of yellow flame formed each to a glowing horn that spilled a golden rain upon the ground and from the blossom of that tree there came forth warmth and a great lightSo in that place which was called Losgar at the outlet of the Firth of Drengist ended the fairest vessels that ever sailed the sea in a great burning bright and terrible And Fingolfin and his people saw the light afar off red beneath the clouds and they knew that they were betrayedIn the front of that fire came Glaurung the golden father of dragons in his full might and in his train were Balrogs and behind them came the black armies of the Orcs in multitudes such as the Noldor had never seen or imaginedHe passed over DornuFauglith like a wind amid the dust and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze thinking that Orom himself was come for a great madness of rage was upon him so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar Thus he came alone to Angbands gates and he sounded his horn and smote once more upon the brazen doors and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat And Morgoth cameBlue was her raiment as the unclouded heaven but her eyes were grey as the starlit evening her mantle was sewn with golden flowers but her hair was dark as the shadows of twilight As the light upon the leaves of trees as the voice of clear waters as the stars above the mists of the world such was her glory and her loveliness and in her face was a shining lightBefore the rising of the sun Earendil slew Ancalagon the Black the mightiest of the dragonhost and cast him from the sky and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim and they were broken in his ruinAnd thus it came to pass that the Silmarils found their long homes one in the airs of heaven and one in the fires of the heart of the world and one in the deep watersEver they dwindled with the years until their glory passed leaving only green mounds in the grass At length naught was left of them but a strange people wandering secretly in the wild and other men knew not their homes nor the purpose of their journeys and save in Imladris in the house of Elrond their ancestry was forgottenThen the name of the forest was changed and Mirkwood it was called for the nightshade lay deep there and few dared to pass through save only in the north where Thranduils people still held the evil at bayIn the twilight of autumn it sailed out of Mithlond until the seas of of the Bent World fell away beneath it and the winds of the round sky troubled it no more and borne upon the high airs above the mists of the world it passed into the Ancient West and an end was come for the Eldar of story and of song     Ah Sauron Maia of Aulbeyond doubt the singularly most enthralling antagonist whom I encountered as a young reader possessing all of the malevolence and dark charisma and naked power of Satan but unhobbled by the multiaspectual morphology of Christian theology and popular culture that far too often rendered the Devil a ridiculous figure a wildeyed and beastly fornication ringmaster cavorting with naked acolytes a scarletskinned pitchforkwielding fashion model for forkedtails and forehead horns or slyly smiling traveling salesman pitching his gimcrack wares backed by looselyenforced contracts claiming lien upon some drinktossed wastrels dubiouslyvaluable soul But Sauronthe dude fell the dude schemed the dude was scary whether donning the raiments of a beautiful translucent ringwise man or an unbearably searingly abhorrent humanoid vessel of the voidThere exists no other book that Ive read as many times as The Silmarillion Much more than the questing heroic storyline of    was I drawn to the background of all those tumultuous events the grand personages and royal lineages that stretched back into the mists of primordial time Where did Sauron come from From what pit originally arose the Balrog What order was Gandalf exactly a member of Who were Beren and Luthien and what relevance did their own story have to this ultimate chapter of the War of the Rings playing out on the pages before me Immediately that I finished the trilogy I rushed into the Silmarillion and though at that time I was still too young to appreciate the allusions to other great mythologies to the wonderful intricacies of the languages that Tolkien had constructed for his MiddleEarth races to the powerful theme of tragedyalways linked with a hubris of the striving spiritthat was enjoined to the Noldorin rebellion against the Valar and their heroicbutdoomed struggle against Melkor He Who Arises in Might Morgoth Bauglir the Black EnemyRadical Valar Renegade Spawner of the Orcs Dark Lord of the Balrogs Tutoring Patron of Sauron in toto Supreme Badass Motherfucker of all MiddleEarthstill I was held spellbound by these glimpses into the Great Creation the Dawn of Elves and Men the Noldorin Exile and the fate of the Silmarils which ended with such a perfect balance the priceless jewels at rest at the bottom of the sea the deepest of earthen chasms and the highest heights of the heavens Whats more after the breaking of Beleriand the reader is presented with the awesome arc of the founding and the doom of Nmenor in which Sauron gloatingly laughed atop the Islands mountain temple and lustfully defied the punishing lighting strokes that sizzled through the nighttime air and the concluding overview of the War of the Rings in which much is explained that makes The Lord of the Rings even more enjoyably complete than when the trilogyand its prequel The Hobbitwere the only source for the incredibly deep history that Tolkien had woven from his lifelong love of languageThese annals with their brilliantlyetched admixtures of beauty and shortlived heroic triumphs set against an overpowering sense of futility and tragic defeat at the hands of an enemy whose cunning is as deep as the infernal pits of his cavernous dungeons and whose malice engirds the starkissed world whose very corruption has been bled into the core of creation itself were just what were needed to spark a young imagination Tolkiens private amusements and delights mirrored my own in their fledgling form and inspired me to tributary tasks of creation that nobody else could understand or appreciate but which gave me immense personal satisfaction They awoke within me the powerful demiurgical desire to craft worlds populate them endow them with their own gods and mythologies formulate a history laden it with political systems the whole works all in the service of a timebound fate that culminates in an apocalyptic showdown betwixt the dark and the light At that point in a persons life when the complex and inscrutable mathematical rituals and hierarchical causality of allpowerful modern science have immense appeal but few handholds the prismatic and primal allure of myth and magic the intuitive interconnectedness of nature with the sorcerously creative will of man even at that tender age a force struggling to avoid restraint and desperately endeavoring to draw power from those spiritual furnaces deep within the font of dreams such tales of heroism and fortitude in the face of the supernatural are for many very hard to resist Whats more the channeling of natural phenomenon into organic spirits with anthropomorphic features and forms offers another intuitivelyappealing means to understanding a vast material world that otherwise seems awesomely inexplicable and frighteningly unpredictable Stories that tap into our innate desire both to be entertained and be edified by human theatre set within the panoramic vistas of a horizonhid pastTolkien delivered in spadesI dont care that it was edited by Christopher Tolkien and Guy Gavriel Kay and thus cant be declared canonical Who gives a shit Some complain that it reads like a MiddleEarth bible that its archaic style and portentous prose are a labor to struggle through and provide nothing as satisfying as the great trilogy he had wrought Ah tell it to the judge They read like the annals composed from the mythological strains that wend across a mysterious fatebound history that they in fact are its just that this particular history was played out solely within the mental confinesa rich cerebral theatreof the author and possessed a coherence and potency to rival the mythologies of the Greeks or the Northmen What more could a reader want If Tolkiens labour of love crafted and edited reworked and rewritten was of such an amazing expressiveness and beauty and power that it both upheld the Ring Trilogy and lit its mythological intimations with a fulgent blaze that only served to augment ones appreciation of the latters depths then why not put it out there for that multitude of fans who were dying to sample more of the mystical marvels from one of the greatest and most uniquely imaginative minds of the past

"text": "Beginning with a short story appearing in Set in a world of extraordinary circumstances filled with stunning visual imagery and unforgettable characters This new edition of      A few things you should know before deciding how helpful this review will be for you I think the Dark Tower series as a whole is a staggering achievement and belongs in any discussion without qualification of the Greatest Fantasy Series of All Time  There are no spoilers in this review but I have read the series twice all the way through and am doing a third reading as part of a group read this month Therefore my review is colored by my knowledge of how the rest of the series is Hence I only give this book  stars because in comparison to the rest of the series I thought this book was by far the weakest In a vacuum I would have probably given this  stars due to the Chilly PalmerJosey Wales awesomeness of the character of Roland  Roland Deschain is THE MAN and belongs among the truly ICONIC figures in th century literature and is certainly among my top ten favorite characters of all time I think this is even more astounding given the Roland himself was initially patterned on the classic iconic western gunfighter Yet through the series I thought he grew beyond his original programming and became a truly unique figure  I have read a number of Stephen King books beyond the Dark Tower series and have really liked some The Stand The Green Mile The Night Shift and really disliked some Dreamcatcher Cujo and The Dark Half I just wanted to be clear that I like Stephen King but am not a everything he writes is gold fanboybeyond the Dark Tower series that is  I LOVED LOVED LOVED the ending of the series dont worry no spoilers I can not think of a better way to have ended this epic series and believe that it created a much more powerful memory of the journey through all  books I think Stephen King should be applauded for allowing the story to take on such MYTHIC importance as I think he achieved with the way he ended this series I know that MANY and I mean MANY disagree with me on this one and I can understand where they are coming frompsssst however just between usthey are all wrong and Im rightbut shhhhhh  I have listened to all  books are audio the first  read by the late Frank Muller and the last  read by George Guidall I believe that anyone who has read the books and not listened to these stories on audio is REALLY MISSING SOMETHING WONDERFUL Those who have listened to the Dune series on audio can understand the incredible quality and enhancement that a superb reading of a great story can bring As mentioned in the above introduction this book only gets  stars from me In large part this is due to both the quality of the later books and also the fact that it is plagued by some inconsistencies that arose due to changes that King made in the later books I applaud King for going back and rewriting this story to resolve these conflicts but I still think this book suffers from the fact that King did not know how LARGE the story would become when he wrote this That said this book is an absolute essential read as it introduced the world to Roland Deschain of Gilead Son of Steven Gunslinger Champion of the White Descendant of the line of Arthur Eld Bane of the Man in Black and Seeker of the Dark Tower How best to describe Roland Physically he was inspired by Clint Eastwoods The Man with No Name and so a younger Clint Eastwood is an excellent way to visualize him   From there you need to mix in a little MYSTICAL TEACHERWARRIORMASTER SLOGAN DISPENSER  Add a helping of NOBLE KNIGHT LEADER  And then top it off with a large triple shot of BAD ASS MOFO  with the end result being one of the most intriguing layered though it takes some time to peel those layers back and complex figures in all of literaturein my opinion In this first installment which is quite short compared to subsequent volumes we are introduced to Roland and the world he lives in as he is chasing the Man in Black Rolands world appears like a deranged version of the Old West but with occasional references to an older world that was much more technologically advanced We are left with the impression of a very ancient world that is fading and running down As Roland describes it his world has moved onWe also come to find that Rolands world is not our world but that there are strange similarities between the two eg Arthur Eld the great hero of Rolands world would seem to be their version of King Arthur both worlds have a version of the song Hey Jude etc In addition we learn that it is possible though difficult to travel between the worlds which is a fundamental aspect of the rest of the series It is in this story that Roland first meets Jake Chambers who arrives in Rolands world from a version of our New York City I will leave you to learn for yourself the circumstances surrounding Jakes appearance and the results Through a lengthy flashback in the city of JethroTull we learn of both the mad skills of Roland as a Gunslinger and the otherworldly powers of the Man in Black My takeaway Roland can shoot the eyes out of hummingbird and  paces From there the book moves ahead briskly until the inevitable final showdown between Roland and the Man in Black The details the interesting nuggets and the time spent with Jake are best experienced fresh so I will avoid spoilers Overall a good introduction to Roland and his world but merely an appetizer to the warm buttery goodness that is to follow and the epic tale of the Gunslinger really gets going in the next book The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed And you should follow to all the way to the end of the story and discover the wonders of this most original journey HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION    The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed Roland Deschain the last of the Gunslingers is on a quest for the Dark Tower a mysterious edifice that is the axle of worlds and holds all existence together In this the first volume Roland pursues his nemesis across the Mohaine Desert He follows the man in blacks trail to a little town called Tull then through more desert encountering a boy named Jake from our world and then into the mountains Will Roland finally catch his archnemesis after years of pursuing him And what means will he go to to achieve his goalWhen I first picked up this book I had no idea it would shoot to the top of my favorites list I wolfed down the first four books in three weeks then entered an agonizing period of waiting for the last three to be published I think Ive read the first four books five or six times each The whole Dark Tower series while on the surface a fantasywestern is really the story of one mans obsession In this volume we get a hint of what Roland will do to get to the Dark TowerThe writing is great and it warmed me up to Stephen King Rolands world is unique Part fantasy part western part postapocalypse While its the first book in a series its quite satisfying to read on its ownIf your looking with fantasy with a different flavor look no furtherAdditional Thoughts from the April  rereadSome of the additions in the revised edition of this book were muchneeded and brought the first book into synch with the later ones Others seemed a little hamfisted and took away a bit of Rolands mystique view spoilerI like the idea a certain Additional Thoughts from the  rereadIn the forward King mentioned he pushed everything else aside to finish the last three books because he felt like he had a sense of responsibility to his readers If only George RR Martin felt that wayIt is mentioned that Roland is the kind of man who straightens pictures in strange hotel rooms Is this a hint of his obsessivenessI notice something new every time I read this book If I had to pick one book that made me want to write it would be this oneview spoilerbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   I listened to the audiobookBuddyread with the adventurous Karly Click to read her reviewSecond Book The Drawing of the Three Third Book The Waste Lands My Gunslinger theme song that I cant get out of my head when reading Knights of CydoniaListen before you start stoning meunderstand that this is a book that needs to be reread after the entire series in order to be fully appreciatedAnd I for one plan on rereading it I love Kings works and I STILL adore his writing with this one but I didnt click with pretty much everything else And because I care about him so much I will recreate one of my favorite reviews Ive written but instead I will take Khanhs suggestion of creating cookies insteadSo here is my cookie recipe for The GunslingerINGREDIENTS  cups of an important mule tablespoon of finding meals teaspoon of sex with some random named Allie  teaspoons of asking about the Man in Black  sticks of random religious references  cups of fucked up dreams or stories from the past cup of current references like Hey Jude Time Square Zorro Statue of Liberty etc quarts of who the fuck is this Jake kidSprinkle in some weird metaphors and imagery that may look weird but taste impeccable tablespoons of NOTHING MAKING SENSE  cups of King being utterly high and hanging out with Hunter Thompson while writing this cups of my curiosity to keep me goingCOOKS NOTENone of this shit has to make sense to you because I read the damn book and I feel the same damn wayDIRECTIONSSTEP Put everything together in a bowl and beat the batter hardcore until it feels like your readers brains are pounding with annoyance but also create a sense of thirst for knowledgeSTEP Preheat oven to  degrees dont ask why just do it Grab a mixer since you dont know how to beat for shit and put it on high speed until reader turns pale and confused do this for about  hours Beat in characterization  at a time so that the reader never feels satisfied Add some philosophical context at the end Reduce speed to low Add some draggy plotlines and stories within a story beat it all until combined Mix in whatever shit you have leftSTEP Using an icecream scooper or your hand if your a cheap bastard drop that goo into parchmentlined baking sheets and make sure to space about  inches apart or youre going to have one giant ass cookie Bake until golden around edges but soft in the middle or in Kings caselet them burn to a crispBut Im willing to bake another batch and give this series a chance and I will read the next one Because I want those delicious cookies man   Well Im trying this thing where I dont DNF books Lets face it Ill probably mess up that resolution though On a similar note who here is still hitting the gym Ha Thought so Dont judge me then Anyway I know this was a short read but it took me forever to finish it I think that the idea is fine but its the writing that is putting me off I feel the same way about Neil Gaiman in that I really like the premise and want to read their works but Im just not feeling their styleApparently Idris Elba is supposed to play the lead character that is if it doesnt go into production Hell like the other attempts to make this Hes another terrific actor who can play anything crosses fingers that hes the next James Bond    The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed That is the line I remembered for years and years that made me think that someday I would revisit THE GUNSLINGERAs a young teenage girl I read THE GUNSLINGER and really didnt like it that much I didnt hate it it just confuuuuuused me And to review this I will have to take you back to when I first read it as a teenStephen King is special to me Special because when I first discovered him it was the first time I went out on my own and read something that wasnt influenced by anyone but me Before then my books were all hand me downs Books I borrowed from my brother like John D MacDonalds Travis McGee series or Nancy Drew from my sister Agatha Christie from my mother My dad loved the classics my friends VC Andrews I enjoyed them all but something told me there was going to be an author that set me apart from the rest of my friends and family books that were going to be alllllllllll mineOne night I watched the movie Dead Zone In the credits it said written by Stephen King and a whole new world opened up to me I read Dead Zone I read Salems Lot I read The Shining The StandFirestarterCarrie I got used to his writing and I was thrilled with it Then I picked up THE GUNSLINGER and all hell broke loose What the hell was this It didnt fit I didnt get it It scared me that this was going to be what the rest of his books were going to be like As a young girly girl I wanted nothing to do with westerns I wanted nothing to do with Roland DeschainThankfully more Stephen King came out that made me happyChristine Pet Sematary The Talisman Thinner Itand so many others I forgot about The Dark Tower and THE GUNSLINGER and went about my merry way But that line always stayed with me The man in black fled across the desert and the Gunslinger followed Fast forward September  two of my favorite Goodreads friends Stepheny and Jeff were reading about Roland THE GUNSLINGER I decided it was time I tried to get past my confusion and move forward Can I join in Of course you canLet the buddy read beginRoland Deschain travels across the desert with his mule in search of the man in black There he comes across Brown a farmer and Zoltan his crow Brown offers to put Roland up for the nightRolands past becomes clearer as the story is toldHis past in GileadIn TullHis meeting with Jake a boy that Roland grows attached to much to his dismayAnd his future told by the man in blackThank you Stepheny and Jeff for opening my eyes to a book I once dismissed I look forward to the rest of the series What a great new beginning

"text": "The masterpiece that started In the aftermath of the brutal murder of his father a mysterious woman Kahlan Amnell appears in Richard Cyphers forest sanctuary seeking help    and more His world his very beliefs are shattered when ancient debts come due with thundering violenceIn a dark age it takes courage to live and more than mere courage to challenge those who hold dominion Richard and Kahlan must take up that challenge or become the next victims Beyond awaits a bewitching land where even the best of their hearts could betray them Yet Richard fears nothing so much as what secrets his sword might reveal about his own soul Falling in love would destroy themfor reasons Richard cant imagine and Kahlan dare not sayIn their darkest hour hunted relentlessly tormented by treachery and loss Kahlan calls upon Richard to reach beyond his swordto invoke within himself something more noble Neither knows that the rules of battle have just changed    or that their time has run outThis is the beginning One book One Rule Witness the birth of a legend It is always curious to see fantasy authors who dont consider themselves to be fantasy authors Caseinpoint Terry Goodkind The former landscape painter has told us how he isnt a fantasy author in every interview hes ever givenThe books I write are first of all novels not fantasy and that is deliberate Im really writing books about human beingsWhat I have done with my work has irrevocably changed the face of fantasy In so doing Ive raised the standards I have not only injected thought into a tired empty genre but more importantly Ive transcended it showing what more it can be   Then the interview usually devolves into a discussion of Ayn Rand and the meaning of art just in case you missed the pretension of declaring fantasy books not fantasyThe guy certainly has a chip on his shoulder but it makes me wonder whether he has actually read any fantasy He doesnt seem to realize that the things he claims separate him from fantasy are fundamental parts of how modern fantasy works A novel thats fundamentally about character interactions with a magical setting How droll Goodkind doesnt reinventing the novel he doesnt even reinvent the fantasy novel he just twists the knobs to get a little more steam out of itMichael Moorcock critiqued Tolkien as a false romantic which is rather apt considering that his love story takes place almost entirely in absentia prompting Peter Jackson to infuse some extra loving with a hot elven psychic dream sequence Most fantasy authors rectify this by having the girl come along for the journey Goodkind likes to keep the separation for much of the story as our hero tries to seek her out across a continent though she is often just in the next room Oh What a tragic coincidence Actually after the first time its just an annoying and painfully artificial way to try to hold off the conclusion for another hundred pages Its a good thing Terry doesnt have to rely on magical or artificial means to keep his stories freshThe rest of the time the hero finds the girl and lovingly transfixes her on his mighty sword No really Im not sure why these authors always end up feeling as if they have to dump their sex fetish issues at this particular juncture Huh I dig BDSM Maybe I should confide my fantasies in a book for mass publicationI cannot think of a single female character in the entire series who isnt either raped or threatened with rape If you want to give me an example of one remember Im counting magical psychic blowjob rape as rape I wish I never had the opportunity to qualify a statement with dont forget the psychic blowjob rapeI dont mind actual BDSM literature but Id rather have my own reaction to it than be told isnt it totally dirty and wrong but still super sexy right Porn for porns sake is fine but remember Goodkind isnt some escapist fantasy author these are real stories about real people so he has to act like his magic porn is somehow a reflection of real lifeGoodkinds books are cookiecutter genre fantasy but the first few arent that badly done and if you like people narrowly missing one another bondage masochism rape and dragons it might work for you but the series dies on arrival partway through so prepare for disappointmentIf you are enjoying the series you should probably avoid reading any of his interviews as he rarely misses an opportunity to claim that he is superior to all other fantasy authors and never compare him to Robert Jordan becauseIf you notice a similarity then you probably arent old enough to read my booksGoodkind truly lives in his own fantasy world if he thinks his mediocre genre rehash is original or deepThen again Ive never met an adherent of Ayn Rand who didnt consider themselves a brilliant and unique snowflake trapped in a world of people who just dont understand The Randian philosophies are also laid on pretty thickly in his books but at least he found a substitute grandmother figure to help him justify his Gorean sexromp as high artAll in all hes just another guy who likes to hear himself talk Despite what he says nothing separates his work from the average modern fantasy author and like them his greatest failing is the complete lack of selfawareness that overwhelms his themes plots and charactersMy Fantasy Book Suggestions   Terry Goodkind is a grossly inept writer with the writing ability of a somewhat intelligent seventhgrader but he jumped into the wideopen fantasy field when there were hardly any good fantasy writers a state that hasnt completely changed btw and he has the persistence to turn out  page novels and so he got published and now hes grandfathered in because some people dont have better taste than to buy his novels Additionally his early work is grotesquely derivative mostly of Robert Jordan as a matter of fact It also includes all kinds of clich fantasy tropes which then never appear again in the series as though dragons and gars just up and wandered off the planet at some point His bad guys particularly in this book are such a mishmash of evil that they became caricatures of evil and are actually laughable For instance either Darken Rahl or his henchman I dont remember which These guys were not just evil and out to despoil everything in sight and out for total power and in cahoots with the evil underworld spirits one of them was also a childmolester to boot Im sure Goodkind would have called him a Nazi had the concept fit into his milieu And finally after about four novels or so Goodkind sacrifices storytelling on the altar of making a political point and since then every book has been a thinly veiled objectivist antireligious and antialtruism rant I dont care that he has a point of view or that he occasionally slips it into his writing but his evil characters have become now not caricatures of evil but meanspirited caricatures of the philosophy he opposes And so he has shown himself through his writing to be someone I would despise quite apart from it someone who cant conceive that the people who see things differently are men and women of good will who have just come to separate conclusions He tortures the crap out of his writing in order to make it serve his convoluted agendaDo yourself a favor and dont start this series Especially if like me you have OCD tendencies and feel compelled to finish what you startAnd yes I am jealousthat a lousy writer like that can have page volume after page volume published and I cant Because frankly I think Im better than he is   Richard and Kahlens Relationship TimelineDay OneRichard Kahlen now that we just met were the bestestest friends arent weKahlen We sure areDay TwoRichard Kahlen were the bestestest of friends and I would give my life for you even though we just metKahlen Me tooDay ThreeRichard Kahlen I love you more than life itself What Its only been three days Well that still seems sensibleKahlen My sentiments exactlyDays Four through Richard Love love loveKahlen I love you but we can never be together ever because of the magicDays  through Random Mord Sith comes in out of nowhere Days See Days Four through More DetailsSo I didnt quite go into this with the best of intentions I wanted to jump on the bandwagon since I felt like the only one not making fun of Goodkind I can however say that I enjoyed Wizards First Rule Ten years ago I would have loved it more than anything Five years ago I still would have really really liked it Today Ive realized Im not quite the same reader I was before Ive always loved what many term the traditional fantasy Farmerscullion learns true history that heshe is the ultimate of awesome the supreme queen of butterflies and aardvarks the master and commanderWhile I enjoyed Goodkinds twist on this traditional tale it was still a bit much for me at times Richard is the boywhowouldbeinserttitle and hes just too perfect Hes good at EVERYTHING Okay hes a wilderness guide so hes good at tracking and woodsy stuff thats the technical term believe me Im a woodsy guide I can get behind that But then he can fight and solve riddles and do rubiks cubes and everythingThen and I kinda feel like a tool talking about this since I dont really know all that much what Im talking about theres the lack of foreshadowing Theres probably a better term that would qualify this but we jump from one adventure to the next Theres the ultimate good versus bad tale going on but to get to the end theres so much padding with multiple adventures in between We have to go to the mud people so they can tell us stuff Oops the mud people cant tell us we have to go to that mountain over there and its such a dangerous mountain Oops again now we have to call a fairy by tapping our ankles twice while holding our breath doing a somersault on a donkey and spelling the word Goodkind backwardI know Eddings Belgariad does much the same thing but that has a special place in my heart whereas The Sword of Truth was just too late in my reading career Add to that the less than stellar feelings toward the later volumes in the series you may not see me carrying onI will say the ending was pretty good and will actually be moving my  star rating up to a  Lucky duck out of  Stars    Wizards First Rule is a good example of why people think all postTolkien Fantasy is trash It bears one tenth of Tolkiens imagination a smaller fraction of his brilliant study and  oh look swords Cliche family drama an angsty romance between tormented lovers powerful characters who are so unjustly tortured  its immature at best At its best it is a clunky and selfindulgently obtuse heros journey Then theres the hundred page BDSM tangent where the hero goes through excruciating pseudobondage games with his captor This part borders on selfparody because the outrageous subject matter is stretched out for so long that it becomes boring and were just waiting for it to end and we know it will because this isnt an inventive story thats going to venture to brave new intellectual worlds The romance is similarly brutal but on the weepy side rather than the sadomasochistic There isnt even the heroempowerment fun of Eragon to turn this into a fun immature adventure  its too slow and anxious for that Instead it builds to a ludicrous climax and a plot twist that you wouldnt think anyone would pen after Star Wars came out But this book would   This is the beginning One book One Rule Witness the birth of a legendThere are books you read onceyou enjoy them and never give them a second thoughtThere are books you love and want to share this love with the entire worldAnd then there are books that are so precious to you that talking about them feels like sacrilegelike exposing your bare soul and instead you safeguard them like a treasureFor meSword of Truth belongs to the latest categoryThe only reason I decided to write a proper review is because its a series that readers either love or hateand I wanted to show you that despite the negative reviews there is something worth reading herea gem that not everyone can appreciate but the ones who dothey will never be the same againSoheres my bare soul  There is a storm coming in the Three KingdomsThe tyrant of DHara is about to put together the pieces of an ancient puzzle that can either give him unlimited power to control the world of the living or destroy life itselfThe wizards have fallenand the only person that stands a chance against him is the Seeker of Truththe wielder of the Sword of Trutha weapon forged with magic destined only for those that are deemed worthyAnd that person is Richard CypherWith a grumpy wizard and a mysterious woman as his companionshe sets off an epic journeya journey to unlock the secrets of magic and human naturegreed and love and find his destiny  He combines adventure and romancemagicevil queens and dragonssorcerers and wild tribespast and presentdeath and lifeHis magic system is extremely wellwrittenhis worldbuilding solid and fascinatinghis characters realisticWhen I read his booksI feel like hes talking to mehe unravels the multiple layers of my soul and when he puts them back togetherhis story is among themIts a part of who I amBecause his writing contains deeper messages and wisdom about life and love that sank into my bones  Every fantasy books narrates a version of the eternal battle between Good and EvilWhat makes Sword of Truth stand outis that the enemy isnt a dark lord who commands legions of nightmarish creatures and wants powerNothe enemy is one mana man who has given his soul to the darknesswhose goal is to eliminate resistance and free willAnd because of his pervertionthis book is darkmaturecruel and sometimes disturbingand themes like rapetortures and human sacrifices are also includedBut without the darknesswe would not appreciate the light  I struggle to find words sufficient to describe why Richard is the best protagonist you could ever ask forHe is not a childhe is a mana man brave and loyal and faira man who tried for years to tame his anger only to find out that his righteous fury will be the means to use the Sword of Truth and deliver justiceno matter how hard it isHe is kind and noblehe can forgive his enemies and fight for people he never met and above allhe is the smartest character I have ever metHe is a heroAnd so is KahlanShe is a woman of powerstrong and confidentdedicated to her mission and a nightmare to her enemiesBut the price of her power is the isolation and fear she inspires to everyone but RichardTo say that they are my favorite couple of all time would be an understatementI ship them in an Iwouldwalkthroughthefierypitsofhelltomakesureyouenduptogether kind of wayDont expect rainbows and pink cloudsthere are forces that keep them apart but their love is steady as a rockIn factI believe those two give the definition of the word love  When I have a problemwhen I cant decide what to doI think of what Richard and Kahlan and Zedd would doTheyre more than friendsthey live inside meAs soon as I read the first pages of Wizards First RuleI knew that my life was about to changeAnd for that I am

the Wardrobe written in  by Clive Stables Lewis But Lewis did not stop there Six more books followed and together they became known as The Chronicles of NarniaFor the past fifty years The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature Each of the seven books is a masterpiece drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generationsThis edition presents all seven booksunabridgedin one impressive volume The books are presented here in chronlogical order each chapter graced with an illustration by the original artist Pauline Baynes Deceptively simple and direct The Chronicles of Narnia continue to captivate fans with adventures characters and truths that speak to readers of all ages even fifty years after they were first published I discovered The Chronicles of Narnia when I was six years old halfway through my first year of school I had discovered the joys of our school library and I still remember the day and the exact shelf where I found The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe It was the lowest shelf the one that rested on the ground and I had to crouch down to wiggle the book out from amongst its peers By the time Id finished first grade Id read them all and searched high and low for any book series that could be as wonderful and magical as this one had beenNow I could dismiss my love of these books as some quaint childhood memory that I was unwilling to let go of Certainly that is a factor However the magic has never faded Ive read them all so many times that Ive memorized them Ive memorized them so thoroughly that Ive told them as bed time stories to children that Ive done baby sitting for Children who have loved the stories and begged to go to bed early so that they could hear MORE about Diggory and Polly or Lucy Peter Edmund and Susan or more about Shasta and Avaris and so on and so forthIts not just children either My husband and I read a book a proper book for half an hour for our son every night For the past month that has been The Chronicles of Narnia Its gotten to the point where he doesnt want to stop Our sons bedtime comes and goes and my husband insists on reading just a little bit more He says things like I wish Id read these as a child Theyre fantasticAre they perfect No The Last Battle is a hard and frustrating read The Magicians Nephew is a little awkward The Horse and His Boy is just a TAD controversial for some of its content But theyre so so worth the read To me theres a magic to these books that time and life has never managed to dim   Overall I would give this book  stars Below I have provided specific ratingsreviews for each story At first I was skeptical about reading the book in chronological order as opposed to publication order Now that I look back at it it works well both ways I also had some trouble at first with the way the style of writing was presented but I got used to it pretty quickly The world of Narnia is well written and detailed thanks to CS Lewis I can safely say that I liked the introduction of every story But I just personally didnt find it to be extremely appealing as a whole This book nonetheless will be someone elses treasure not mine I liked it but I just wasnt too crazy about it The Magicians Nephew  stars I would surely want to reread this story again in the near future Such an original plot I enjoyed every minute of it Getting to know the backstory and how Narnia was created was interesting to me Many people didnt like how there were connections with Christianity but I found it to be quite creative There were a few metaphors between Adam Eve and the tree of wisdom Digory and Uncle Andrew were my favorite characters even though at times the uncle seemed quite cynical My favorite moment would have to the fight at the lamp post and how they escaped One quote that stood out to me was What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing It also depends on what sort of person you areThe Lion Witch and the Wardrobe  starsI liked these characters they engaged me throughout the whole story My favorite character were the two youngest ones Lucy and Edmund They seemed to always have something going on with them There was also more human and animal interaction in this story than in the previous one but its interesting to read about Again there are several religious metaphors present in this story too It was pleasurable reading and seeing all the symbolism We also get to see more of the magical world of Narnia in this story so that is exciting I had fun with this story The Horse and His Boy  stars This story started of interesting but I just wasnt so captivated by the  main characters The concept is good but it just isnt appealing to me The desert scene felt eternal to me and unexciting I did not hate it but I cant say I liked it It was ok Compared to how great the previous two were this wasnt on that levelPrince Caspian  stars In this story we are introduced to Prince Caspian and I must say he was a well written character The backstory about him and finding out how he commences his journey is interesting I seem to enjoy the introductions of each story quite immensely this one being one of my favorites The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  starsMy favorite part of this story was the involvement of the new character Eustace Even though he was portrayed negatively at first it was interesting viewing how he slowly changed The dragon scene was enjoyable to me I am not a big fan of all the other scenes they werent bad but just not mind blowing The Silver Chair  starsThe beginning of the novel was fun which is when Eustace and Jill embark on their new adventure They are sent on a mission and we read about their journey I found many parts dull This story didnt have much of an impact on me The Last Battle  starsThis story ends the series of The Chronicles of Narnia There were several parallels to heaven and at first these religious metaphors didnt bother me much in the previous strories but I just didnt like how they were used here It felt like one part of the novel dealt with adventure while the other part dealt with religiongodcreation themes      Terrific fantasy setting and storyline spoilt by extremely unsubtle allegory and as the story progresses excessive Christian preachiness Warning Racial stereotypes abound and may offendRecommended for adults who thrive in a Christian religious environment or those who can overlook these aspects totally and enjoy the story Not for gullible children unless accompanied by a discerning adult  I wont insult the intelligence of respected GoodReaders by giving a synopsis of the Narnia stories  I dont think there will be many here who do not know this story even if you have not actually read the books The stories of the four Pevensie children who discover the magical land of Narnia through the back of a wardrobe is the stuff of legend in literary circles  a land which they rule over as kings and queens after freeing it from the enchantment of the White Witch under the benign yet firm supervision of Aslan the lionAs fantasies for children go this is a terrific universe filled with possibilities There are talking animals magical creatures from Greek mythology and English fairylore and suitably satisfying and mysterious landscape worthy of exploration again and again So one feels that if only the author in C S Lewis had let himself go he could have produced something similar to the The Lord of the Rings Unfortunately he does not do that The author sublimates himself to the Christian so that the story becomes allegory  and mostly allegory The spirit of gungho adventure is coated over with sicklysweet preachiness which becomes so cloying towards the end that one almost feels like throwing upThis book contains the novels in the chronological order as regards the story The Magicians Nephew The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe The Horse and His Boy Prince Caspian The Voyage of the Dawn Treader The Silver Chair The Last BattleHowever the actual order in which the books were published is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Prince Caspian The Voyage of the Dawn Treader The Silver Chair The Magicians Nephew The Horse and His Boy The Last BattleIt seems that there is a hot dispute going on about the order in which the books should be read After reading them in the chronological sequence I would advise reading them in the sequence of publication IMO the last two  The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle  are better left unread especially the last one More about that laterAslan the Lion is Christ  this becomes evident in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe itself view spoilerhe sacrifices himself to save Edmund Pevensie and is immediately resurrected  The White Witch and later the Queen of the Underworld are embodiments of Evil with a capital E I was a bit surprised that there was no sign of the gentleman with the horns and the forked tail Evil is entirely feminine  that too with a perverse sort of sexual attractiveness It seems Lewis was genuinely frightened of womans sexuality Susan becomes a nonfriend of Narnia the moment she becomes a nubile young woman Lewiss protagonists like that of Lewis Carroll are prepubescent girlsThe Christian world view is evident from the word go  for example the animals and birds can all be killed and eaten provided that they are not talking animals They have been specially blessed as such by Aslan we are told in the story of the creation of Narnia in The Magicians Nephew This evidently comes from the Bible where Man is given dominion over every living thing on earth In case we dont get it Aslan continuously addresses the boys as Sons of Adam and the girls as Daughters of Eve and says that only they can rule over Narnia As the story progresses it becomes more prevalent  and now racism and intolerance of the heathens also come into playThe Calormenes  darkskinned foreigners who worship a savage god Tash wear turbans and carry scimitarlike swords  are an Englishmans fantasy of the bloodthirsty and lecherous Turk In their country young girls are routinely married off to old codgers and they wage war on the free countries like Narnia to rape and pillage Their God Tash however is a pagan deity who is loosely associated with the gentleman I mentioned earlier  the guy with hornsThe unlikeable brat Eustace Scrubb is the son of liberal parents who are pacifists and vegetarians He studies in a school which does not have corporal punishment and which does not teach the Bible  and is therefore full of bullies who are encouraged by the Principal However Eustace reforms after a visit to Narnia and returns back to the school and hammers the living daylights out of the bullies The Principal is removed from the school and ultimately becomes a Member of Parliament where she lives happily ever after note the point M P s are failed schoolteachers who fail to put the fear of God into childrenIt is in the last book that Lewis outdoes himself There is an ape who presents a donkey as Aslan The ape is part of a conspiracy with the Caloremenes who present their God Tash and Aslan as the same but dont believe in either view spoilerIn an Armageddon of sorts Narnia is destroyed Tash eats up his worshippers and the dwarves who believe in neither are confined in a dark stable of their own creation the fate of atheists  Also the ending is patently silly view spoilerall the friends of Narnia being killed in a train accident so that they can inhabit Aslans timeless paradise  and for me it was disgustingThen why the three starsWell if you can ignore the allegory and the preachiness there are some pretty interesting adventures here The first three books are rather wellwritten although a bit simplistic and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is your classic sea adventure The Magicians Nephew is extremely funny in parts One advise to prospective readers though  please give the last book a missbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   The Magicians Nephew is easily the best story of the Chronicles First of all its the least overtly religious There is a creationoftheworld element but its not our world so it seems more fantastic than religious Not only is there a veil over the religiosity theres so much creativity in this story the magical rings the inbetween place the Deplorable Word the founding of NarniaStarting with The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe the religiosity becomes noticeable with the Witch as Satan Aslan as Jesus and the Emperor as God And because of the talking fighting animals the fantasy seems aimed at children I might have enjoyed it more at age The next story in the series The Horse and His Boy takes a dark ethnocentric turn with its unfavorable depiction of the Arablike Calormen shoes turned up at the toe scimitars suffixed phrases of praise son of lineage declarations In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader we get a notquitepositive summary of the Calormenthey are a wise wealthy courteous cruel and ancient people They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long complimentsbut of course what they wanted was the money they had paidGiven that this book was published in  its possible to forgive the cultural insensitivity but its sad that children around the world still uncritically read such racist materialThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader demonstrates the problem with using God or Jesus in a story there are no real conflicts When the Dawn Treader stops at Dragon Island the boy passenger Eustace wanders off encounters a magical spell and is turned into a dragon This raises all kinds of serious issues about how to keep Eustace the Dragon with them but none of these problems matter because within  hours Aslan just changes Eustace back to a boyThere was a similar deus ex machina the term being used most appropriately in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe To save Edmunds soul Aslan sacrifices his life But it wasnt Aslans only life he had another one readyOne thing I found especially creative about The Chronicles is how a story involving talking animals justifies eating animals   I cant even begin to count how many times Ive read The Chronicles of Narnia The truly amazing thing about these books is that each time you read them they magically become more complex more meaningful and more beautiful I first read The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe when I was about seven or eight years old and I did not get it at all Sure I followed the story but the deeper meaning was completely lost on me Someone later told me that it was a Christian story and when I read the book again as a young teenager I picked up on that element of it In the many times Ive read the books as an adult Ive come to find that the underlying meaning  not just of The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe but of the other books as well  becomes gradually clearer until you cant believe you didnt see it all along The books are like Narnia itself unfolding like an onion layer upon layer Narnia upon Narnia but each layer is bigger and better than the one above it In order of the events that unfold in the story but not in the order that the books were published the Chronicles of Narnia includeThe Magicians Nephew  the Narnian creation story Two children living in London are magically transported to other worlds and witness the dawn of Narnia The story incorporates such familiar elements as a Tree of Knowledge and the fall of manThe Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe  Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy four children living in England during World War II stumble through a magic wardrobe and discover the land of Narnia which has been ruled for hundreds of years by an evil White Witch who has cast a spell over the land so that it is always winter but never Christmas With the help of Aslan the great Lion they seek to free Narnia This is the most obvious Christian parable as Aslan represents Jesus and the story parallels the Resurrection storyThe Horse and His Boy  Takes place during the Golden Age of Narnia although most of the events unfold elsewhere in the southern lands of Calormen and Archenland Shasta a Calormene fishermans son runs away when he hears his father negotiating to sell him into slavery Together with two talking horses and a noble Calormene girl running away from an arranged marriage he tries to get to Narnia The book is a meditation on faith and the concept that God helps those who help themselves Its also my favorite of the seven booksPrince Caspian  Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia to help young Prince Caspian recapture the throne of Narnia from his evil uncle Miraz Not the most overtly religious of the storiesThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader  Edmund Lucy and their obnoxious cousin Eustace join Caspian now King of Narnia on a quest to find seven banished lords who had served his father It doesnt seem all that religious until the end of the book which encourages people to seek God in their own livesThe Silver Chair  Eustace whose personality has dramatically improved thanks to his time in Narnia returns with his school friend Jill to search for Prince Rilian Caspians son who went missing ten Narnian years earlierThe Last Battle  Eustace and Jill return again to Narnia to assist King Tirian the last King of Narnia in his final stand The book is a parable of the End of Days with chaos confusion war unbelief and the worship of false gods Tirian Eustace Jill and their friends can only hope that Aslan returns to Narnia to deliver themRead them then read them again and again and again You wont be sorry   "},

is split and there is treachery at court Worse the vengeancemad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities He claims the Iron Throne There are plenty of fantasy authors who claim to be doing something different with the genre Ironically they often write the most predictable books of all as evidenced by Goodkind and Paolini Though Im not sure why they protest so muchpredictability is rarely a death sentence in genre fantasyThe archetypal story of the hero the villain the great love and a world to be saved never seems to get oldand theres nothing wrong with this story when its told well At the best its exciting exotic and builds to a fulfilling climax At the worst its just a bloodless rehash and the worst are more common by farPerhaps it was this wealth of predictable cliche romances that drove Martin to aim for something different Unfortunately being different isnt something you can choose to do any more than you can choose to be creative Sure Moorcock wrote Elric to be the antiConan but at some point he had to stretch out and find a core for his series that was more than just thatand he didIn similar gesture Martin rejects moralistic romance tearing the guts out of epic fantasy the wonder the ideals the heroism and with them the moral purpose Fine so he took out the rollicking fun and the social messagewhat did he replace them withLike the postMoore comics of the nineties fantasy has borne witness to a backlash against the moral hero and then a backlash against the grim antihero who succeeded him Hell if all Martin wanted was grim and gritty antiheroes he didnt have to reject the staples of fantasy he could have gone to its roots Howard Leiber and AndersonLike many authors aiming at realism he forgets that truth is stranger than fiction The real world is full unbelievable events coincidences and odd characters When authors remove these elements in an attempt to make their world seem real they make their fiction duller than reality after all unexpected details are the heart of verisimilitudeWhen Chekhov and Peake eschewed the easy thrill of romance they replaced it with odd and exciting charactersthings strange enough to feel true In comparison Martins world is dull and gray Instead of innovating new radical elements he merely removes familiar staplesand any world defined by lack is going to end up feeling thinDespite trying inject the book with history and realism he does not reject the melodramatic characterization of his fantasy forefathers as evidenced by his brooding bastard antihero protagonist with pet albino wolf Apparently to him grim realism is Draco in Leather Pants This produces a conflicted tonea soap opera cast for an existentialist filmTheres also lots of sex and misogyny and walltowall rapenot that books should shy away from sexor from any uncomfortable unpleasant reality of life The problem is when people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality start writing about it and it seems to plague every mainstream fantasy authorTheir pen gets away from them their own hangups start leaking into the scene Its not about the characters anymore its the author cybering about his favorite fetishand if I cyber with a fat bearded stranger I expect to be paid for itI know a lot of fans probably get into it more than I do like night elf hunters humping away in WOW but reading Goodkind Jordan and Martinits like seeing a Playboy at your uncles where all the pages are wrinkled Thats not to say there isnt serviceable pop fantasy sex out thereits just written by womenThough I didnt save any choice examples I did come across this quote from a later book  Imagine the process Martin sits hands hovering over the keys trying to get inside his characters headOkay Im a woman How do I see and feel the world differently My cultural role is defined by childbirth I can be bought and sold in marriage by my ownOh hey Ive got tits Man look at those things go whooshing mammary sound effects Okay time to writeWhere are the descriptions of variouslysized dongs swinging within the confines of absurdlydetailed clothing There are a set of manboobswhich perhaps Martin has some personal experience withbut not until book five Even then its not the dude being hyperaware of his owntheyre just there to gross out a dwarf Not really a balanced depictionIf youre familiar with the showand its parodies on South Park and SNLthis lack of dongs may surprise you But as Martin himself explained when asked why theres no gay sex in his books though there are gay characters theyre not the viewpoint charactersas if somehow the viewpoints he chooses to depict are beyond his control Apparently he plots as well as your average NaNoWriMo author sorry none of my characters chose to be gay nothing I can do about itAnd balance is really the problem hereif only depict the dark gritty stuff that youre into thats not realism its just trying to hide a fetish If you depict the grimness of war by having every female character threatened with rape but the same thing never happens to a male character despite the fact that more men get raped in the military than women then your gritty realism card definitely gets revokedThe books are also notorious for sudden pointless deaths which some suggest is another sign of realismbut of course nothing is pointless in fiction because everything that shows up on the page is there because the author put it there Sure in real life people suddenly die before finishing their lifes work fantasy authors do it all the time but theres a reason we dont tend to tell stories of people who die unexpectedly in the middle of things they are boring and pointless They build up for a while then eventually lead nowhereNovelists often write in isolation so its easy to forget the rule to which playwrights adhere your story is always a fiction Any time you treat it as if it were real you are working against yourself The writing feels the most natural is never effortless it is carefully and painstakingly constructed to seem that wayA staple of Creative Writing  is to listen to how people really talk which is terrible advice A transcript of any conversation will be so full of repetition halfthoughts and nonspecific words stuff thing as to be incomprehensibleespecially without the cues of tone and body language Written communication has its own rules so making dialogue feel like speech is a trick writers play Its the same with sudden character deaths treat them like a history and your plot will become choppy and hard to follow Not that the deaths are truly unpredictable Like in an action film they are a plot convenience kill off a villain and you dont have to wrap up his arc You dont have to defeat him psychologicallythe finality of his death is the great equalizer You skip the hard work of demonstrating that the hero was morally right because hes the only option leftLikewise in Martins book death ties up loose threadsnamely plot threads Often this is the only ending we get to his plot arcs which makes them rather predictable any time a character is about to get enough influence to make things better or more stable he will die Any character who poses a threat to the continuing chaos which drives the plot will first be built up and then killed offI found this interview to be a particularly telling example of how Martin thinks of character deaths  Hes not talking about the internal motivations of the characters or the ideas the characters representhe isnt laying out a wellstructured plothes just building up a character then killing them to defy expectation But the only reason we think these characters are important and expect them to succeed is because of how Martin sets them upHe treats them as central heroes spending time and energy on them but it all ends up being a red herring so he can get rid of them for a cheap twist Its like the mystery novels of the s when all the good plots had already been done so authors added ghosts or secret twins in the last chapterits only surprising because the author has torn up the structure of their own book and with it the relationship between author and readerAll authors begin by writing plot arcs that grow and change building tension and purpose Normally when such arcs end the author must use all the force of his skill to deal with themes and answer questions providing a satisfying conclusion to a promising idea that his readers have watched growOr you could just kill off a character central to the conflict and bury the plot arc with him That way you never have to worry about closure you can just hook your readers by crafting a new arc from the chaos caused by the dissolution of the previous one Start to make the reader believe that things might get better to believe in a character then wave your arms in distraction yell and point look at that terrible thing over there and hope your audience becomes so caught up in worrying about this new problem that they forget that the old one never actually resolvedBy chaining false endings together you can create a perpetual tension that never requires solutionlike in most soap operasplus the author never has to do the hard work of finishing what they started If an author is lucky they die before reaching the Final Conclusion the readership is clamoring for and never have to meet the collective expectation which long years of deferral have built up Its easy to idolize Kurt Cobain because you never had to see him bald and old and crazy like David Lee RothUnlucky authors live to write the Final Book breaking the spell of continual tension and expectation that kept their readers enthralled Since the plot has not been resolving into a tight intertwined conclusion in fact its probably been spiraling out of control the author must wrap things up conveniently and suddenly leaving fans confused and upset Having thrown out the grand romance of fantasy Martin cannot even end on the dazzling trick of the vaguelyspiritual transgressive Death Event on which the great majority of fantasy books rely for a handy tackedon climax actually hell probably do it anyways with dragonsThe drawback is that even if a conclusion gets stuck on at the end the story fundamentally leads nowhereit winds back and forth without resolving psychological or tonal arcs But then doesnt that sound more like real life Martin tore out the moralistic heart and magic of fantasy and in doing so rejected the notion of grandly realized conclusions Perhaps we shouldnt compare him to other writers of romance but to HistoriesHe asks us to believe in his intrigue his grimness and his amoral world of war power and deathnot the false Europe of Arthur Robin Hood and Orlando but the real Europe of plagues power struggles religious wars witch hunts and roving companies of soldiery forever ravaging the countrysideUnfortunately he doesnt compare very well to them either His intrigue is not as interesting as Ciceros Machiavellis Enguerrand de Coucysor even Sallusts who was practically writing fiction anyways Some might suggest it unfair to compare a piece of fiction to a true history but those are the same histories that lent Howard Leiber and Moorcock their touches of verisimilitude Martin might have taken a lesson from them and drawn inspiration from further afield even Tolkien had his EddasMore than anything this book felt like a serial melodrama the hardships of an ensemble cast who we are meant to watch over and sympathize with being drawn in by emotional appeals the hope that things will get better in this dark place tragic deaths even if these appeals conflict with the supposed realism and in the end there is no grander story to unify the whole This grittiness is just Martin replacing the standard fantasy theme of glory with one of hardship and despite flipping this switch its still just an emotional appeal Heroes always win is just as boring and predictable as heroes always loseIts been suggested that I didnt read enough of Martin to judge him but if the first four hundred pages arent good I dont expect the next thousand will be different If you combine the three Del Rey collections of Conan The Barbarian stories you get  pages including introductions end notes and variant scripts If you take Martins first two books in this series you get  pages Already less than halfway through the series hes written more than Howards entire Conan output and all I can do is ask myself why does he need that extra lengthA few authors use it to their advantage but for most its just sprawling undifferentiated bloat Melodrama can be a great way to mint money as evidenced by the endless variations on a theme of Soap Operas Pro Wrestling Lost and mainstream superhero comics Plenty of people enjoy it but its neither revolutionary nor realisticSome have tried to defend this book by saying at least Martin isnt as bad as all the drivel that gets published in genre fantasy but saying hes better than dreck is really not very high praise Others have intimated that I must not like fantasy at all pointing to my lowstar reviews of Martin Wolfe Jordan and Goodkind but it is precisely because I am passionate about fantasy that I fall heavily on these authorsA lover of fine wines winces the more when he is given a corked bottle of vinegar a ballet enthusiasts love of dance would not leave him breathless at a high school competition and likewise having learned to appreciate Epics Histories the Matter of Europe Fairy Tales and their modern offspring the fantasy genre I find Martin woefully lackingTheres plenty of grim fantasy and intrigue out there from its roots in epic poetry to the Thousand and One Nights to the early fantasies of Eddison Dunsany Morris Macdonald Haggard and Kipling Then there are more modern authors Poul Anderson Moorcock MJohn Harrison Vance Susanna Clarke Neil Gaiman Mervyn Peake China Mieville Phillip Pullman Howard Lovecraft and LeiberThere seems to be a sense that Martins work is somehow revolutionary that it represents a new direction for fantasy but all I see is a reversion Sure hes different than Jordan Goodkind and their ilk who simply took the pseudomedieval highmagic world from Tolkien and the bloodandguts heroism from Howard Martin on the other hand has more closely followed Tolkiens lead than any other modern high fantasy authorand I dont just mean in terms of racismTolkien wanted to make his story realnot realistic using the dramatic techniques of literaturebut actually real by trying to create all the detail of a pretend world behind the story Over the span of the first twenty years he released The Hobbit the Lord of the Rings and other works while in the twenty years after that he became so obsessed with worldbuilding for its own sake that instead of writing stories he filled his shed with a bunch of notes which his son has been trying unsuccessfully to make a complete book from ever sinceIts the same thing Martins trying to do cover a bland story with a litany of details that dont contribute meaningfully to his characters plot or tone So if Martin is good because he is different then it stands to reason that hes not very good because hes not that different He may seem different if all someone has read is Tolkien and the authors who ape his style but thats just one small corner of a very expansive genre Anyone who thinks Tolkien is the father of fantasy doesnt know enough about the genre to judge what originality meansSo if Martin neither an homage nor an original Im not sure whats left In his attempt to set himself apart he tore out the joyful heart of fantasy but failed replace it with anything worthwhile There is no revolutionary voice here and there is nothing in Martins book that has not been done better by other authorsHowever there is one thing Martin has done that no other author has been able to do kill the longrunning High Fantasy series According to some friends of mine in publishing and some amusingly onthenose remarks by Caleb Carr in an NPR interview Martins inability to deliver a book on time combined with his awful relationship with his publisher means that literary agents are no longer accepting manuscripts for high fantasy serieseven from recognized authors Apparently Martin is so bad at structuring that he actually preemptively ruined books by other authors Perhaps it is true what they say about silver linings   Though I declined to finish this book Ill leave you with a caution compiled from various respectable friends of mine who did continue onIf you need some kind of closure avoid this series No arcs will ever be completed nothing will ever really change The tagline is Winter is Comingits not As the series goes on there will be more and more characters and diverging plotlines to keep track of many of them apparently completely unrelated to each other even as it increasingly becomes just another My Fantasy Book Suggestionsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   Reader LogicI HATE this bookI HATE it so much I had to get a new hardback copy to read so I could underline all the parts I HATE about it so much and post them on GoodreadsI HATE it with such a passion I also bought copies for all my friends and family also in new hardback editions so they could HATE it along with meWhen the TV series came on I was so fuming with rage I watched the entire season twice and bought six copies of the DVD because I could not believe how much I could HATE somethingI had spent so much time discussing how much I HATE this with all my friends who HATE it too and who all bought copies I decided to get a George RR Martin tattoo on my buttock to show how strong my HATRED for his work is There was such a collectivity at the timelike everyone uniting in HATING this togetherthat some of us formed relationships in HATE I met my wife at a George RR Martin convention and we got married as one of the characters reciting parts of the book for our vows and paid GRRM all our life savings to come read from his HORRIBLE book We HATE this beyond belief Maybe one day well read a book we like and the author can get rich on LOVE   I really feel the necessity of a bit of personal backstory here before I start the review Back in  when this book first came out and I was about  or  years old I saw the hardcover on a sale table for about  and couldnt resist a bargain still cant though Im more cautious these days So I started reading this book with the vague idea that it was a flop and that may not have helped but I got through  pages of it before feeling so crapped off with it that I shoved it in my cupboard and tried not to think about it Page  to be exact More on why laterIf youve heard of this book or read it youre probably aware that far from being the flop I assumed it was at the time and I didnt know anyone who was reading it the series has gone on to be one of the big Cash Cows of the fantasy genre Computer games roleplaying games  theres even a board game that looks like Risk Sooner or later therell be a movie or something no doubt Im moderately surprised one isnt in the works already People love this book and this series So Im well aware Ill probably be lynched for this review because even the people on Goodreads who didnt like it still had great things to say about itBut reviews are subjective and heres mineIn the vein of Tolkein Jordan Elliott Goodkind Hobb Eddings Feist et al A Game of Thrones is set in the classicly boringandoverdone medievalEnglandesque setting and is essentially about a bunch of nobles fighting over a throne Great Very original Praised for its focus on political intrigue its lack of magic and similar fantasy tropes and its cast of believable and interesting characters I found the book tedious The first epic fantasy series I read after Narnia was Jordans The Wheel of Time series and its true that I struggled with the first book Eye of the World But there were elements to it that I liked characters who I felt attached to enough to read the second book and become hooked and so on I love page long fat fantasy books I love huge casts of characters and have no problem keeping up with them Ive read Jennifer Fallons Wolfblade trilogy and Second Sons Trilogy both of which are heavy on political intrigue and very low on magic and theyre supurb A Game of Thrones is not It offers nothing new to the genre and does nothing original with what it hasNarrated in turns by Eddard Ned Stark Lord of Winterfell his wife Lady Catelyn his bastard son Jon Snow his very young daughters Sansa and Arya his middle son Bran Tyrion Lannister a dwarf and brother to the Queen and young Daenerys Targaryen last of the line of dragon kings and exiled to the land beyond the narrow sea the book is divided into neat chapters headed by the name of one or the other so you know exactly whose pointofview youre going to get and where you are in the plot Thanks for holding my hand Martin but I dont like this technique The chapter headings Im referring to It encourages me to start wondering about the character before Ive even started reading CATELYN the chapter title reads is she young or old a peasant a farmer a daughter a mother nice mean I start imagining things and then have to correct it all as the character is revealed during the chapter Theres power in names and withholding them or putting elements of a characters personality first is often more compelling and better writing It also made it harder to get through the book because at the end of one chapter Id see the name of the next think oh great himher again their storys boring and put the book downLet me be perfectly straight I did not find any of the characters to be particularly interesting though Jaime Lannister had something about him you hardly ever saw him They all pretty much felt like the same character just in different situations The differences between them for example the goodgirl Sansa and her tomboy sister Arya felt forced superficial and clichd Ned is all about honour and duty but especially honour with love a more minor consideration but honestly could the man be more stupid Eddards a moron and dull and his only saving grace is that hes nice to his daughters Lets be clear about something else right here this world and its people are so sexist and misogynist its ludicrous There are many derogatory references to womens tits metaphors about screwing whores descriptions of Daenerys getting her nipples pinched by her horrible brother Viserys  not to mention her marriage at twelve to a horselord whose men rape women like theres no tomorrow incest and so on The first time I tried to read this book I was offended and disgusted it didnt help that Id read Pillars of the Earth not long before though I did not grow up sexually repressed or prudish or anything like that I have never found reading descriptions of rape to be all that easy especially when theyre treated so dismissively  yet oddly my impressions of the characters were much more favourable I read it now and I just felt contemptNo one character stands out though Arya has potential Catelyn is as boring as her husband and her sister Lysa is lets face it mad as a hatter and a sure sign of why women are unfit to rule a clear message in this medievalesque patriarchal world Queen Cercei too Tyrion the dwarf seems on the verge of having charisma but fails and Daenerys I want to like someone but Martin doesnt give his characters any depth Sure theyre all flawed and a flawed character is a great literary device  the antihero etc But Martins characters are walking clichs even the dwarf The plot is also pretty weak I dont need elves and magic and dragons  in fact I tend to avoid them especially elves yawn  but youve gotta give me something else A bildungsroman does wonders  yes let me see the characters on a journey of life rather than a quest quests are tired Theres no quest in A Game of Thrones and thats fine with me But what is there Jon goes to the Wall that separates the wilderness from the Seven Kingdoms why is it called the Seven Kingdoms when theres only one kingdom and is attacked by an Other a kind of zombie creature Ned goes to the capital to take up the role of Kings Hand because the King Robert likes to spend his time boozing whoring and hunting Catelyn follows to tell him someone tried to kill Bran Ned tries to discover why the previous Hand died And swords with names seriously whats with that Im so sick of such blatant phallic symbols and their representations and the whole creed of honour and duty and gallant knightsWhat frustrates me most is that this could have been a really interesting story if only the author had better talent at writing characters  or letting them write themselves The plot is not the problem though its largely uneventful with no climactic moments because even those are written at the same pace as the rest with no drammatic flourishes come on we all like those lets be honest But the characters sigh their motivations are simplistic their actions extremely predictable and while they dont blur one into another neither do any of them stand out Also the type of setting seems mostly convenient with the focus on the nobles and their squabbling you dont learn much about the lower classes or what kind of food is grown here or what kind of industry supports the economy or anything about the cultures  using the clichd medieval England setting allows Martin to ignore one of the more fascinating aspects of society and leaves his world shallow like surface water without support using this old and worn Fantasy setting allows an author to get lazy about worldbuilding The history of the land is also riddled with clichs and sort of thrown in here and there as if to remind the reader it is a real place look heres what the First Men did As for the writing its easy to read and calm though very slow and rather lacking in tone or any interesting stylistic quirks flat and bland in other words Theres no atmosphere in this book Therere a few bad lines like A storm of rose petals blew across a bloodstreaked sky as blue as the eyes of death p  his one concession to drama it seems though if you read it again youll notice it doesnt actually make sense and a few awkward sentences that leave you scrambling such as Catelyn watched her son Robb Stark mount up Olyvar Frey held his horse for him Lord Walders son two years older than Robb and ten years younger and more anxious p I noticed a similar sentence later and I guess I know what he means but really its terrible writingOn the plus side there were a few things I liked The direwolves  large ferocious animals as constant companions and protectors always a winner with me the intriguing climate where summer and winter lasts years decades even before changing how does that work Seriously what do they eat Daenerys dragon eggs and the Dothraki the horse lords  though they were pretty superficial and confined to a rigid list of adjectives  I would have liked to understand their culture better In many fantasy books my problem is the whole good vs evil clich which generally involves the plot Here my problem is that the characters are so blackandwhite They are described good thats settled now what Theres no grey No character development They never once surprised meI honestly dont know if Ill read the next book The Wheel of Time taught me at the same age as I first tried reading this book  that the first book in a series can be the weakest because of the amount of extrapolation and background etc that goes on I didnt find that problem here it was very grounded in the now which makes me think the next book will be more of the same I keep coming back to the reasons why I struggled to finish this book boredom clichd and empty characters not enough balance as in theres no love in this book and if the characters are so realistic why dont they love and predictable events You know what it reminds me of Marion Zimmer Bradleys equally famous The Mists of Avalon  another book I couldnt finish If you like Arthurian fantasy and that kind of style then this would be a good book for you the excessively patriarchal culture the battles the hint of magic and something glorious lurking around the edges but never coming to the fore its all here neatly packaged Obviously it works for a lot of people But to all those people who say that Martin has opened up the genre in new ways that he is the best writer of the epic fantasy crowd and so on I have to wonder have they read anything else And then I wonder whether its a matter of which author you read first and grow attached to and so compare all the others I dont think I fell into that trap as such because Jordans lost the plot literally Goodkinds personal politics and propaganda have taken over his story and the one epic fantasy series that I love above all others  to date  is Kate Elliotts Crown of Stars series which I didnt start reading till I was in uni But I really wonder how this story grabbed other people If it grabbed you Id love to hear how and why because sometimes I feel like Im too jaded or something too snobby maybe    EDIT  Dec  I no longer get notifications for the comments Feel free to duke it out with each other just dont expect me to respondWARNING If you enjoyed this book even a little bit you may not want to read this review It will probably make you angry Heaven knows that the book made me furious and I intend to turn every bit of that wrath back on itInstead I suggest you read karens review Brigids review Joyzis review or any other of the gushing four and fivestar reviews here If video reviews are more your style I suggest Melina Pendulums vlog about this bookRealistically I know a lot of you are not going to listen which is why the edit is here At least it will slow you down a littleEDIT adding one more thing because despite the warning and the redirect links I kindly provided I have indeed gotten the kind of sexist bullshit comments I anticipated Before you launch into the usual defense therefore I give you thisAlternatively some fans may find it tempting to argue Well this media is a realistic portrayal of societies like X Y Z But when you say that sexism and racism and heterosexism and cissexism have to be in the narrative or the story wont be realistic what you are saying is that we humans literally cannot recognise ourselves without systemic prejudice nor can we connect to characters who are not unrepentant bigots Um yikes YIKES you guysSourceHeres the scoop on this review For a book that I hate I usually write a lot After suffering for several hundred pages I have pleeeenty of things to say Ive never hated a book that was quite as long as this one quite as much as I do so Ive had to alter my review so that I can say everything I want to without going over the character limitThe first part is an unorganized rant I marked pages with particularly annoying quotes on them for these rants I broke the book into segments of  pages and wrote up quotes and responses for each segment into separate blog posts These are all linked belowThe second part will be a more organized rant masquerading as a review MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS A HATER REVIEW IF ANYTHING WAS GOING TO CAUSE ME TO SPONTANEOUSLY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO BREATHE FIRE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THIS BOOKPart Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Pages Part There are books I dont likeThere are books I And thentheres this book which did its level best to drive me to drinkingand I dont even like alcoholI wanted to like this I wanted it to be as excellent as so many people insist it is There are some books that I went into expecting them to be horrible but this isnt one of them Oh my hopes were high here  it was recommended by a plethora of great authors including the guys of Writing Excuses who I absolutely love Reviewers who I greatly respect rated it four and five stars and wrote at length about how awesome it was Other people praised the book as the greatest achievement of the fantasy genre so far and Martin as the greatest fantasy writer of all timeIts those last two that are most important I think because I love the fantasy genre  always have and hopefully always will Fantasy is what got me into reading well Harry Potter specifically and its been one of my mainstays for as long as I can remember I bought this book in large part because it was so often touted as if not always the greatest achievement of the genre one of the major works of fantasy published in our time Having recently read several works by Brandon Sanderson all of which were innovative highly readable and deeply philosophical I was excited to see what Martin by all reports an even better writer than Sanderson could do I expected my mind to be blown repeatedly and to be faced with the challenge of writing a review for a book so staggeringly brilliant that I could hardly think straight after finishing itThat is far far far from what I gotFirst of all this book is definitely not what I think of when I hear the word fantasy Its certainly far from my definition of high fantasy Now I realize that my definition of high fantasy which includes pervasive magic unusual creatures and a setting that is vividly far from the real world is not the definition youll find if you look the term up online I also dont care Seeing as the critical definition appears to characterize high fantasy solely by the fact that it doesnt take place on our Earth and as this definition is written as if high fantasy and swordandsorcery are mutually exclusive Im inclined to conclude that whoever wrote said definition is pretty damn stupid and carry on with my own outlines of what makes fantasy high low urban epic or any other subcategory or combination thereofThat said  this book High fantasy Not as far as Im concerned It is to say the least distinctly lacking in the requisite elements of the fantasticIs it possible that Martin is going for a the magic comes back subplot over the course of the series Definitely Do I give two shits about the rest of the series NOPEThis book comes off as a pathetic attempt at fantasy by someone who doesnt really care about the genre or doesnt know much about it It mostly struck me more as an alternate universe War of the Roses fanfiction with some hints of magic thrown in in a halfassed attempt to give it a place on the genre fiction shelves of bookstores You can explain to me over and over how Martin intended to make his world gritty and realistic and I will tell you over and over that that shouldnt matter that it is possible to have a fantasy which is gritty realistic and also utterly fantastical Its even possible to do it without losing the particular areas where Martin seemed to be trying for gritty realism since he chose to make all of his characters of the nobility anyhow he wouldnt have had to worry about overglorifying the lives of the peasantry as one might with a more economically diverse castNow Im willing to give Martin the benefit of the doubt a little bit on the possibility of the magic comes back thing because there did seem to be elements here that could become fantastical if fully explained later The problem of course is that theyre tossed out without background let alone proper explanation and so feel jarring and out of place  not a coherent part of the world but bits tossed in to be linked together later Right now all they managed to do was trip me up throw me assoverteakettle out of the story and leave me blinking at the page in confusion and not a little bit of frustrationAnd yeah maybe part of why Im so sore about this is that like I said I started this book not long after reading some Sanderson and Sanderson is basically the king of seamless fantastical elegant worldbuilding so pretty much anyone looks bad in comparison but stillIf I had to assign this book to a genre Id call it low fantasy because as far as Im concerned it was running too low on the qualities that make fantasy what it is Its about as much fantasy as fanfiction that translates characters to the modern day is  namely basically mundane with a miniscule twistThe characters of this book also stand out and not in a good wayThere are a lot of them  eight POVs and plenty more on the side  and not a single one of them is likeable They all had the potential to be which makes it worse Bran the Stark boy who learns too much and is crippled as a result could have an interesting arc if it werent so slow and drawnout The hints of genuine pathosinducing story are definitely there Theyre also present in the chapters focused on Catelyn who is the closest Martin gets to a truly nuanced character Ned Stark Catelyns husband is supposed to be the noble one  too bad his nobility comes off as stupidity instead Jon Snow Neds bastard child is a truly stereotypical fantasy character the super special outcast who is nonetheless generally loved except by those the narration makes a point to show as bigoted and cruel who never really has to work either for physical skills or personal growth and who gets gifted by the narrative with an absurd number of SUPER UNIQUE TRAPPINGS including an albino wolf really Martin REALLY Are you secretly a fourteen yearold girl writing horrendous anime fanfic or something Answer no and the comparison is insulting to fourteen yearold girls and a bastard sword that was a family heirloom of a noble house not his own Arya is by far the most entertaining of the Starks but only because she fulfills all sorts of rebelliousnoblegirllearnstofight tropes that Im quite fond of Sansas chapters made me set the book down for days on end she is beyond a shadow of a doubt the most insipid annoying airheaded character I have ever read and she has not a single whisper of a redeeming quality Tyrion Lannister is what Jon Snow could have become without the heapings of Gary Stu in his youth a bitter middleaged man with father issues who turns to sex and crudity as his only defense somewhat akin to Catelyn he had the potential to be interesting and nuanced if his behavior hadnt been played dead straightAnd theres one more Daenerys Targaryen Oh Dany Dany Dany I could write a dissertation on Dany and everything that went wrong with her story  but I dont have that kind of timeFor those of you not familiar with this most epic of George RR Martins characterization and plot failures here is a summaryoh and spoilers but I honestly cant be bothered to tag itWhen we first meet her Dany is thirteen years ond and about to be sold effectively into marriage with Khal Drogo a warlord of the Dothraki people by her abusive and notalittlebitcrazy brother Viserys Viserys has convinced himself that Drogo will help him take back his kingdom  this being the Seven Kingdoms where the rest of the book takes place  hence the whole selling his sister to be raped by married to someone he obviously sees as a barbarian thing The marriage occurs and then the wedding night in truly squicky halfdetail There then follows a long journey across the plains to a Dothraki city during which Dany is raped and no I will not call it anything else by Drogo By her fourteenth birthday she is pregnant When they arrive in the Dothraki city Viserys makes such an ass of himself that Drogo kills him by pouring molten gold over his head in the middle of a feasting hall Robert the current king of the Seven Kingdoms who the Targaryens see as a usurper sends assassins to kill Dany  naturally they fail  and Drogo gets so angry at this that he decides to commit all his people to attacking the Seven Kingdoms in retribution They leave the Dothraki city at this point Dany is heavily pregnant and go out to wreak havoc across the countryside on their way to conquest In one such battle Drogo is wounded because he refuses to care for the wound properly it gets infected When it is clear that he is going to die Dany appeals to an old woman to perform forbidden magic to save him the rest of Drogos people do not approve and try to cast Dany out End result Dany loses her child to create a Drogozombie which she then smothers When his body is placed on the traditional pyre she adds in three supposedly dead dragon eggs given to her as wedding gifts and which any fool could see hundreds of pages off were bound to hatch and surprise surprise they hatchTo which my primary objections are The blinding obviousness of the ending The fact that this single plotline  this single POV among eight  is so far distant from and so barely related to the others  The first two are selfexplanatory the third of course is the big thorny problem Now I can sort of understand the perspective which argues that Dany is taking control of her sexuality  she comes to enjoy sex and even to initiate and control it at times However SHE IS AT NO POINT OLDER THAN FOURTEEN Theres a reason that such a concept as an age of consent exists  there is an age at which teenagers are genuinely immature and probably shouldnt be making lifechanging decisions like say things that could get them pregnant Now I understand that in the medieval times like those that this book is based on girls were getting married and having children a lot earlier and that people in general were more mature at an early age However Dany shows none of that maturity until after shes been with Drogo for weeks  if not months When shes married to him she is if anything unusually innocent for her age Its a little hard for me to accept the idea that shes taking control of her sexuality when shes so young and clueless that her first sexual experience is a choice only inasmuch as she chooses not to fight back Not fighting back by the way doesnt mean its not rape particularly in the situation that Dany is in vastly younger than Drogo vastly weaker browbeaten by her abusive brother and told over and over that her obligation is to do whatever her husband wants Nor are her later sexual experiences ones of choice in fact it is explicitly stated that even when she had horrible saddle sores and could barely walk she was expected to be available for sex and treated as such If anything her eventual enjoyment of it seems more like a psychological block put up as a survival tactic than genuine pleasure in the act or love for DrogoYet despite the fact that this situation is obviously beyond a shadow of a doubt rape its never addressed intext If anything its portrayed as a positive experience for Dany one that makes her stronger and enables her to stand up for herself Stupid me I thought that the cancerous expansion of rapeaslove was limited to abusive jackass love interests in YA paranormal romances clearly I was wrong Its everywhere people We are all completely fucking doomedWhich brings me to one of the other major frustrations I had with this book the sex Ummm what to say I thought reading some of the Vlane bits of Darkfever while sitting next to my mother on the plane was uncomfortable to my utter shock that was nothing compared to reading the sex scenes of this book alone No worry about someone looking over my shoulder and reading about MacKayla Lane getting hot and bothered  and yet even more awkward Why Well as one reviewer put it and I wish I could remember who to give them credit theyre written kind of as if theyre these tremendous mythic events I cringe at the very thought of quoting them but to give you a little idea of what theyre like worst romance sex scenes youve ever read  bizarre flowerly euphemisms  gratuitous use of the word manhoodgeneral strange reverence for penises above and beyond the norm  incidences of incest  Game of Thrones sex sceneIn general AWKWARDJust to be sure you feel my painThis book felt maleoriented in a way that is so painfully forced that it made me distinctly uncomfortable I dont mean that women cant enjoy it  obviously as all the reviews I linked back at the top demonstrate they can and they do I mean that the book itself felt as if it were written for the most stereotypical male audience imaginable As Tatiana described it it reads like a soap opera for men Because MEN want lots of violence sex swearing by female genitalia and paperthin motivations right Which is exactly what Martin dishes upand so is the book hes producedI thought at around the halfway point that Id finish the book and be able to watch the HBO show to get the rest of the series without suffering through more awkwardly described sex scenes not to mention the rest of it By the time I finished though I had developed such a virulent hatred for this book its author and everything related to either of the above that I start grinding my teeth just reading praise for it Watching the show would be vastly to my detriment  mostly because neither my hand nor my bank account would do well after I put my fist through the screen of my laptopIn conclusionsummaryOh and to the diehard defenders of this series like those who were plaguing Keelys review who like to tell people who disagree with them that GRRM is the greatest writer of ALL TIME and that the female characters presented herein are feminist or to use an exact quote that GRRM has written some of the most independent selfreliant heroines ever to grace the fantasy genre Its more than half the reason hes so beloved His female characters disdain male attention are always smarter faster deadlier and braver than any of their male counterparts Kinda like feminists with swords which is complete and utter bullshit I have only one thing to sayTHANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT   yupnerds now i am among youthis is going to be a review where i just prattle on and on about meee meee meee because lets face it  there are a million reviews of this puppy out there so i dont have to worry about doing a disservice to the book youll either read the book or you wont but you should its got direwolvesi wasnt going to read this after years of watching hordes of desperate sadeyed nerds coming up to me asking any news on the george rr martin release like the bn computer knows more somehow than the internet it doesnt and i would have to tell them not without some schadenfreudeglee nope  it has just been moved back another year it gave me a solid sense of there but for the grace like when you see a very young junkie and you congratulate yourself for dodging that particular bulletdespite what i kept hearing about how awesome the books were i just filed it away in the mental RA folder of stuff nerds like and figured one day i would read them you know  for research but not before they were all out  i wasnt going to get sucked into the trap of so many before me  the waiting game of disappointment and having to reread the older books again and again to keep track of who was even alive at this point when you play the game of thrones you play to become frustrated and impatienti have seen it a hundred timesso when the teevee show came out and people were drooling over how good it was i paid them no mind i pushed it two feet past the someday pile in my brain because i am not one of those people who watch a movie before reading the book am ibut connor wore me down he really wanted me to see it and he wanted to talk to me about it and his bearded little face was all lit from within with enthusiasm and i just couldnt say no to himso i did it i watched the teeveee on demand  several episodes in a row pissed off if i started to get too sleepy to make it through another episodeso so goodso now i had to read it right i owe it to the gods of fine literature and allso i did and god this book is funi am glad they changed a few things for the filmed version  im not sure i would have been too comfortable watching a thirteenyearold actress play daenerys in the same line of thought  natalie  i know you have not watched the show yet but your crush on jon snow perfectly understandable to someone watching the show  he has that dark brooding thing i can see a girl going for but if you have only read the books girl your crush is on a fourteenyearold boy i have notified the authorities you pervin the end i am glad i watched the show first if only so that i know how to pronounce the characters names oh you crazy high fantasy novels and your namesalfonso wont read this series because of the incest and because they never tell you where the soldiers pooped i am not kidding several people complain that the seasonal imbalance complicates the growing cycle and where is all their food coming from this point i can understand  fantasy novels are supposed to care about developing a fullyrealized world and all and that is kind of a major detail but it doesnt bother me at all i am no connoisseur of fantasy i am a dilettante at best so i dont care where people are getting their food  i dont care if the social hierarchy is a realistic one given the particulars of this realm i certainly dont care where the soldiers are pooping nor do i care in any novel where and when the characters poop i just like this books quiet intrigues and betrayals the diplomacy the lack of hesitation when it is time for a character to be killed off i love how there arent any good guys or bad guys only effective and ineffective characters every one of them does at least one thing thatll make a reader go oh bad move so he dropped a few details when it comes to agriculture  he spent all his energies into creating characters that i love reading aboutthere are facets to this thing  sides of the argument rarely seen in a straightahead rollicking plotdriven novel and im not really sure where the misogyny accusations come from is it because women cant really ascend to power except through marriage because i dont think that was invented for this book  i am pretty sure that has happened historically in other places and if its the looting and raping well  that happens in war too wait is it sansa yeah shes kind of a wash but the girl wants what the girl wants shes at least more complicated than bella right there are plenty of good characters here that arent weak or powermad or just regularmad okay  there are a couple but sheeeeit  all the characters here are pretty bad on the moral spectrum right littlefinger is my very favorite but i wouldnt want to know him in my real life i appreciate his devotion thoughso i am super excited about clash of kings both the book i will read and the show i will watch swords and boobies and direwolves i dont even know how i am going to make it until thenoh because i was talking about boobies and HBO just there connor was telling me this story about louis ck and i loved it and i found this quote it is relevant hbo is nuditycrazy but he took care of their lust for fleshHBO was asking us why there was no nudity on the show and what they really meant was Why wasnt Pamela Adlon who played my wife nude When I hired Pam I didnt tell her she was going to be doing anything like that It wasnt supposed to be that kind of show So I said You know what Ill do it And I did that episode and they were like OK we have plenty of nudity thank youhbo thwartedlook dana i read one of your books and i have just discovered betterbooktitlescom   "},
{"title": "Assassins Apprentice",
"isbn": "0006480098",
"author": "Robin Hobb",
"text": "In a faraway land where members of the royal family are named for the virtues they embody one young boy will become a walking enigmaBorn on the wrong side of the sheets Fitz son of Chivalry Farseer is a royal bastard cast out into the world friendless and lonely Only his magical link with animals  the old art known as the Wit  gives him solace and companionship But the Wit if used too often is a perilous magic and one abhorred by the nobilitySo when Fitz is finally adopted into the royal household he must give up his old ways and embrace a new life of weaponry scribing courtly manners and how to kill a man secretly as he trains to become a royal assassin I havent read a lot of fantasy in the last decade so the fact Ive read  of Robin Hobbs books in the last  years says a lot about how much I enjoy reading her work The adventures of Fitz through three trilogies account for a big chunk of that readingRobin Hobb can write a first person story with rare skill She shows you a world though Fitzs eyes and makes it matter makes it vital Some elements of Hobbs fantasy are fairly old school but written with a modern style and a literary skill that one almost never used to see in fantasy and is still hard to find in the genreWhat Hobb does best quite possibly better than every other fantasy writer is build develop and breathe life into relationships She writes great characters that you can believe in but its in interactions that they truly shine The friendship between Fitz and the Fool is the heart of the two trilogies and grows at a slow but steady pace through the booksThe rigid social structure and its constraints generate a lot of frustration for Fitz and by extension for the readers This drives much of the tension and plot Some readers may find it too frustrating and may long for Fitz to break free of it to drive his message home etc but for me it was perfectly pitched for maximum effectI wont address the plot  but its good and the mysterious attackers are chilling and intriguing In short  go read this classic   I feel so sorry for Fitzchivalry because he had such a rough start to life The boy is despised for the simple fact that he exists He is a royal bastard and his dishonourable conception means that his fathers name is forever sullied that much so that he was forced to abdicate the throne thus half the royal Farseer court already hates Fitz because he is supposedly the reason why the popular Prince had to retire from court life Poor poor Fitz he was hated from the very beginning  He was used rather than destroyed  I think King Shrewd truly lives up to his name sake because he has such an interesting way of dealing with unwanted potential claimants to his throne Instead of simply murdering Fitz and ridding himself of a potential threat he binds the boy to himself with unwavering loyalty He turns Fitz into an assassin he gives him a home and protection in return for one day being the assassin of the Farseer court Nobody else could give the unwanted boy such a deal Shrewd is truly shrewd I think this is a truly brilliant idea naming characters this way because the individuals eventually begin to embody their names sake it helps to demonstrate what a particular character is about and make them sound rather royal in the process I love it Not all characters are named this way but for those that are it works really well The character development in this novel alone is phenomenal Fitz is forged into an assassin in just three hundred pages though this is no easy task His mentor Chade is kind and guiding but he also expects a great deal out of his pupil Fitz is forced into an unsuspecting test of loyalty and in his childlike innocence he could quite easily have made the wrong decision Most children would have but he has a slight edge he has Farseer blood And he has also experienced the worse the court has to offer Fitz has learnt to survive and he has learnt to accept his mentors advice almost without question Learning is never wrong Even learning how to kill isnt wrong Or right Its just a thing to learn a thing I can teach you Thats allBut that doesnt mean Fitz has to like his work it is something he must do In this Fitz never loses himself He becomes an assassin but he doesnt become a murderer Its a thin line I know However if the people being assassinated pose a threat to the peace of the Six Duchies then surely the deed can be considered noble and just To my mind Fitz is truly heroic because of this He is the perfect protagonist and he is written wonderfully None of this is easy for him though The killing is hard but learning his innate magic is even harder His upbringing is a truly arduous time because of this he is not only being trained as an assassin but also to wield the ancient magic known as the skill Two fantastic magic systems  Robin Hobbs magic systems are as dangerous as they are spectacular Fitz trainer in the skill a powerful form of telepathic magic is a tyrannical and sadistic man he is one of those strong haters of the boy and uses every opportunity to abuse and torture him He is the exact opposite of the kindly Chade he is simply brutal The Skill masters hatred for Fitz is completely unreasonable and undoubtable As the novel progresses the reasoning behind the cruelty becomes less and less obvious until its odd origins are revealed Fitz truly didnt have much chance picking up the basics of the skill form this so called master of the magic he struggles for many years with it afterwards because of his treatment by the brute Very little worth knowing is taught by fearAnd if that wasnt enough for poor little Fitz to shoulder he also has the Wit magic This is even harder for him to understand because he is not fully aware that he has it It is a rare form of power that allows him to communicate with animals This communication can then form unto a lasting bond if both user and beast mutually agree They link minds in lasting friendship His surrogate farther Burrich views the magic as a perversity and punishes the boy whenever he suspects he uses it thus Robin Hobb has given Fitz a lot to deal with The result is a very confused boy who has too much of a burden Its a miracle he actually manages to get out of bed in the morning with the amount of things craving his time and attention At this point I dont think I really need to say I love this book but Ill do it anyway I love this book This is such a great opening to the series and whilst it is already complicated for Fitz its only going to get worse this is merely the beginning of his life and his story He has barely seen the Fool for what he is yet which is much more than a jester I cant wait to read the rest of the series again and post my reviews This is my favourite modern fantasy series Nobody does this quite like Robin Hobb she weaves such strong emotions into her charactersThe Farseer Trilogy Assassins Apprentice An overwhelming five stars  Royal Assassin   A character defining five stars   With the exciting news of a brand new series about Fitz  the Fool The Fools Assassin in mind we are buddy reading this series in December and continue with the Tawny Man trilogy Yup Im all set for some funky reason Id feel weird about reading Robin Hobb on my Kindle so I got the entire series in English paperbacks toopBuddy read with Kat joins for book  DamianJoshuaEmLeefirst timer woootErika and Im confident well catch up withDayDreamer Original review January Boy if I had never found this book in a discount shop as a teen A few Hobb trilogies further along the way this is where it all started At first Assassins Apprentice seems like your typical fantasy book Yep the unwanted orphan seaside fortress clandestine politics a good dash of magic and adventure are all present However Hobb is something else To say that these books are pretty intense is an understatement I will just mention that while engrossed in the last chapters of the second book and then book three of this series I actually started missing my train station Twice And had to wait for at least half an hour in the dark dreary February weather to catch a train the other way Considering I usually dont enjoy being late for dinner and having to turn to crappy coffee in Styrofoam cups for comfort seriously that SAYS something   I find a lot of fantasy authors are in love with the internalized conceptions of their worlds This can lead to great nuanced detail supporting imaginative storytelling but the flipside can be a creation that fails to translate that vision to the actual page to the audienceAssassins Apprentice illustrates this point fairly well Robin Hobb has clearly lovingly created the world of the Six Duchies and this love is echoed through the tales device born a bastard son to the kings heir Fitz recalls growing up in the intense environment of court and his first mission as the kings assassin Its not the most original premise but Hobb revels in the details of the worlds class divide and trade routes and political alliances However she forgets to tell us why we should care about any of thisIm sure the whole thing is some epic prequel to Fitzs story of some sort but I want to hear that story not the backlog Its not unpleasant but after the fifth exposition dialogue of political machinations in which I was given no stake I didnt really see a reason to continue reading The main character simply meandered around in a seemingly unending training montage with nary a purpose in sight I dont mind a slow buildup but the ideas here while artfully portrayed were still very much in a genericcourtfantasy mold giving me no incentive to stick around no payoff to collect Rating  star   Buddy read with Wearily I regard the faltering trail of ink it has tracked down my page I have seen that shape before I think but it was not ink then A trickle of drying blood on the deck of a RedShip and mine the hand that spilled it Or was it a tendril of smoke rising black against a blue sky as I rode too late to warn a village of a RedShip raid Or poison swirling and unfurling yellowly in a simple glass of water poison I had handed someone smiling all the while The artless curl of a strand of womans hair left upon my pillow Or the trail a mans heels left in the sand as we dragged the bodies from the smoldering tower at Sealbay The track of a tear down a mothers cheek as she clutched her Forged infant to her despite his angry cries Like RedShips the memories come without warning without mercyAn angry old man arrives at the gates of Buckkeep capital of the Kingdom of the Six Duchies dragging his sixyear old grandson along Determined not to listen to his daughters desperate cries from behind them the old man delivers the child to a guardsman and demands that his father take care of him from now on And the childs father he says to the perplexed guardsman is Prince Chivalry Farseer kinginwaiting and heir to the throneThe boy who comes to be known as Fitz becomes something of a liability for the Farseer royal family upon his untimely arrival at Buckkeep Chivalry a man whose honour is everything to him abdicates his position in the line of succession and thus causes an uproar in the Six Duchies And Fitz himself doomed to the life of a bastard must put his life in the hands of King Shrewd And he must decide between being put to death for no other reason than being who he is and being turned into a lethal weapon for the king to use An assassinRobin Hobbs writing is one of the strengths of this novel It is extraordinarily simple and yet greatly satisfying I also really enjoyed the books narrative written from the point of view of Fitz as an old man describing the events of his youth That kind of retrospective nostalgic writing style is deeply reminiscent of one of my alltime favourite authors Bernard Cornwell And even though Cornwell in my opinion does it a lot better Robin Hobb is also quite certainly a master of this artThe setting is not particularly complex or innovative but one could say that it like so many other aspects of this novel grows more and more interesting for each single chapter The Kingdom of the Six Duchies is like most other medieval fantasy settings a feudal monarchy built by farmers and soldiers Most of the story takes place in the capital city of Buckkeep but some of the most interesting events occur in outlying villages or even in the bordering Mountain Kingdoms The fact that Hobb reveals remarkably little of the other locations cultures and nations of this world also helps to make it seem more mysterious and fascinatingThe characters are a bit more difficult to talk about Aside from Fitz himself almost every single character is completely generic and more or less onedimensional In Chivalry Verity and Regal we have three different versions of royal princes all so often found in medieval fantasy and their father King Shrewd is most definitely a rather typical monarch Most of Fitz teachers also fit the various stereotypes of fantasy Despite all that I should say that I really enjoyed reading about them Within the confines of their roles these characters were very well developed Robin Hobb seems to have a way to make her readers care about what happens even to minor characters not to mention the protagonist himself And there are obviously also a few more interesting characters like the Fool and the Lady Patience who were the two characters of this book whom I enjoyed the mostSpeaking of patience that is absolutely something one needs to read this book When it comes to the composition and the progression of the story Robin Hobb so far reminds me a lot of Robert Jordan in the way that both authors apparently write books where nothing at all seems to be happening and then they bombard the reader with tons of excitement and drama in the last five to ten chapters One needs to get almost halfway through this book before the plot finally starts moving forward But when it finally does that its hardly even possible to put it downIn the end Assassins Apprentice was an enjoyable book to read It is not among the best fantasy books Ive ever read but it was great fun reading and it piqued my curiosity enough that I certainly want to read the rest of the books set in the Realms of the Elderlings and get to explore this wonderful world further   "},

"text": "Written by Robert Jordan and completed posthumously by Brandon Sanderson The Wheel of Time is one of the greatest epics of fantasy and a  internationally bestselling series Taking place both in our past and our future the saga tells the story of a man destined to face the Evil One and save the worldor destroy it in the process For me this is the definitive work of fantasy literature Everything I look at reading comes up for comparison with this seriesas well it should as I started reading when there were only  books out I remember eagerly snatching up The Path of Daggers as a teenager when it came out I remember hunting Winters Heart down in a local library and I was devastated when Robert Jordan passed away in I lost track of it over time and only recently reread all  books more than a decade after my journey first started It took about six months but I was able to find the first  books onlineA few cons and then to the prosThe dialogue compared to naturalflowing conversation or todays youngadult novels seems stiff and not how normal conversations would actually go This is especially noticeable in the first book but I quickly became desensitized due to the sheer awesomeness of the storyseveral of the women characters Nynaeve primarily are a littleover the top in their drama and some of the female storylines really bog down the series about halfway through Women play a HUGE part in this series but the interfemale drama is clearly told from the viewpoint of a man who somehow sees women as more complex than they actually are Jordan likes describing things A lot Between this and the thick female drama there are several sections of the series where youre tempted to skim more than to readAt the th book Brandon Sanderson took over writing after Robert Jordan passed away A Gathering Storm was the most difficult to read for me because Sanderson nearly ruined two of my favorite characters up to that point in the storySothese seem like pretty big pitfalls right Why is it still the best epic fantasy everThe characters The story progresses in classic epic style from humble beginnings to the grand scale But the characters are SO fullly fleshed outwith flaws strengths quirks and so on They plot they pursue their own goals and theyre often convinced of something the reader knows is false You become intimate with them like old friends You feel the sense of wonder at the new world as characters discover things you can feel the desperation in hopeless situations you take part in the mirth and frustration and every mood that the characters feel The worldbuilding is massive meticulous and consistent throughout the series I dont mean to say that every nation culture quirk is broken downand explained in detailbut rather theyre fleshed out throughout the series You become familiar with the distinctive dress speech naming conventions habits and temperaments of well over a doezn different cultures through the book without him ever breaking down and having to explain it At the time that Brandon Sanderson took over the writing there were about  million words of Wheel of Time in print Robert Jordans comprehensive notes included more than  million words of unpublished description of the world of character traits of nations and histories everything And that meticulous care is shown in every book The foresight having read most of the series twice is incredible Events in the first book foreshadow events as late as the th book written years after the author had passed away And by foresight I mean not just in hinting at whats going to happen several books before it does but also in anticipating what a modern reader would think up and then implementing that I remember thinking about events and possibilities as they opened up and imagining like a silly fantasy nerd kid how I would do this or use it in that wayand then two or three books later feeling both excited that he thought of the same thing I did and crestfallen because there didnt seem to be an obvious way to improve upon itThe magic system is beautifully complex and Robert Jordan never actually calls it magic which is pretty cool Its presented as a natural force which some can channel and with rules as straightforward but as complex as normal physics The fabric of the universe itself called the Pattern and the way that our lives threads of the pattern weave through it like some giant cosmic quilt creates a really niftybut also deepconcept Which is like other things in the series revealed gradually and maintained consistently throughout the series The humor Sometimes dry sometimes overt but usually theres just a sprinking of subtle comedy mixed in that make it readable Hes superb at summing a character up in one or two sentences from another characters perspective that makes you just stop and chuckle a bit The ending which is worth the whole slog After Book  Brandon brings his inconsistencies back in line and the last two books are almost like one gigantic extended climax Its fulfilling and its satisfying and its worth it And its comforting to know that Robert Jordan wrote out the entire last scene years before we actually got to read it    Started this series June  Around book  it turned from reading for pleasure into a project I was determined to finish so I began just taking my time Once Sanderson took over the story picked back up but even he at times exhibited a bit of Jordans writingjusttowrite feel As another reviewer put it the story is great but there is so much unnecessary burdensome text to slog through that it brings my satisfaction with the series way down That being said the character development is great Although at a minimum I would expect an author to provide indepth character stories when you have thousands of pages in which to do it I did in the meantime finish Sandersons two completed books in his Stormlight Archive series Those are great While I wouldnt recommend the Wheel of Time series perhaps you should checkout Sandersons books for something similar but more succinct    The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again In one Age called the Third Age by some an Age yet to come an Age long past a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist The wind was not the beginning There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time  But it was a beginning Jordan Robert  I knew when I started this beastly series it would be an investment and the investment was worth it by a long shot Wheel of Time exceeded in a fantasy story about heroes It seems fantasy besides Sanderson and a few others has gone very dark lately Dont get me wrong I still enjoy those but nothing rings more with me then a story about heroes that rise up beyond what they think is possible to put evil at bay The Wheel of Time does this as well as any The character list is vast and I grew to actually care about them all Our three core heroes Rand Mat and Perrin were exactly what we wanted and I loved it The series possessed a large detailed vast rich world and a magic system that was fantastically described and written I read about scenes that will forever be printed in my mind and caused me more than once to think that was freaking awesome Now it wasnt perfect a few of the middle books in the series did drag on with lots of description but man writing  books there is bound to be a few we dont like Overall The Wheel of Time series requires some time and investment but the payoff is worth every page you turn and I recommend to all who enjoy heroic fantasy RIP Robert Jordan and thank you for the amazing journey you took me on    I suggest this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy can make the time commitment to get through  pages and deal with some slow books in the middle If you like great prose this will work for you Character development Jordans your pusher Compelling story This is your hook up However be prepared to be frustrated with effusive excess and repetitionMark Twain encouraged James Fenimore Cooper to eschew surplusage Jordan should have done that too And so should I actuallyEverything I have to say about the series can be found in my reviews for the individual booksNew SpringThe Eye of the WorldThe Great HuntThe Dragon RebornThe Shadow RisingThe Fires of HeavenLord of ChaosA Crown of SwordsThe Path of DaggersWinters HeartCrossroads of TwilightKnife of DreamsThe Gathering StormTowers of MidnightA Memory of Light   Well  pages takes some timeIts hard to encapsulate a review of  books in one post But I didnt want to do individual books because after five and until Brandon took over become quite a bit of a blur Some random thoughts The first several books are outstanding After five it starts to slow down but is still fine Eight through eleven become a slog though If I hadnt known that Brandon was taking over I probably wouldnt have survived that I felt like the final three were uneven but at least things were happening At the close of Knife of Dreams so many side quests had finally been completed that maybe the avalanche of events would have finally started anyway But in any case as everything begins to happen in The Gathering Storm its just such a relief The unevenness came in some of the characterizations Mat had grown so much from his entry to Ebou Dar to the end of Knife of Dreams and all that growth was stripped away in The Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight I do think it was reclaimed in A Memory of Light though  Even though Rand can be boring I dont really tend to like the Chosen One in any series Mat and Perrin are great Of course during the middle book slog they at times would become boring too I think the saving grace of the series as a whole is that the three of them were never all boring at once  The conclusion was excellent Many threads were brought together in an emotionally satisfying way Few questions were left unanswered and those that were just contributed to the depth of the world I do think that the busyness which was required to answer the questions showed that there was a lot of room to edit without substantially changing the story eg Padan Fain  While the ending was great I was truly hoping for a longer LOTR style wind down from the Last Battle Of course such things are not done these days but it would have been nice   "},

"text": "Since the debut of Robert Jordans internationally bestselling series in  The Wheel of Time has transported readers to a world so strikingly real so rich in detail and complexity it seems to rise from memory rather than a printed page This essential companion to The Wheel of Time is for the millions interested in the history and the background of this incredible seriesneverbeforetold legends previously unknown peoples and lands exotic beasts and portents of what may come to passWith more than seventy new fullcolor paintings that include stunning new world maps portraits of the central characters landscapes objects of Power and national flags this comprehensive guide is indispensable to any Robert Jordan fan This book is definitely only for WoT fans for it has no story line it is a comprehensive chronicle best possible sic of the universe in which WoT series events are taking place prior and during themThere are a lot of facts related to the lost Age of Legends the Breaking the Trolloc Wars the Artur Hawkwings reign and the War of the Hundred Years But as the author saysThis compilation of the worlds geography sociology and history uses information dating from the earliest available records of the Age of Legends through the current eraThe way chosen to present these historical facts is simply outstanding for as seen above it couldnt have been more better written to make it appear more real than it doesRating it  stars is kinda subjective of me because the illustrations are the ugliest I have ever seen in such a book But I chose to not take them in consideration  Jordans universe and writing genius deserve all the  stars PS this book historical facts are limited to volume  of WoT but in November should appear The Wheel of Time Companion The People Places and History of the Bestselling Series which will cover all volumes in the series Can hardly wait for it   You have to be a special sort of reader to read and enjoy this book thoroughly First of all one needs to take a minute to grasp that all of this history and geography existed INSIDE THE AUTHORS HEAD A lot of this was clearly never intended to be in the novels it was background information that the author needed to shape the places characters and the decisions the characters made You are not going to find a story in this book Basically if you put yourself into the world of the Wheel this would be a history and geography text book This book is for fans of the Wheel of Time series that are also history buffs or simply people who want to know more about the worldI have read reviews from people saying that this book does not cover information found in later books That is correct It says right in the book that it only covers up to book seven in the series Looking at the publication date you can clearly see why that is    Fondly or at least accurately known as the Big Book of Bad Art in Wheel of Time fanatic circles The text is fine  a bit dry mostly superceded this was published barely halfway through the series before quite a few mysteries were settled but generally interesting at least to completist nerds like me The internet is a better resource for nerdery though which would make the only major virtue of the book the artAnd the art she is bad Sloppy poorlyproportioned irrelevant generally contextless and charmless The maps are lovely  and there are quite a few reproduced here  but they are reprints of maps from the hardcovers The fullpage spreads of the covers are nice enough I suppose  the advantage to the book being published only halfway through the series is that none of the really appalling Darrel K Sweet covers were out yet But the original art is just terribleWhich makes me sad because if Tor put out a postseries version of this with some of the spectacular ebook covers theyve recently commissioned and just a few pieces original to the book and of course with updated text I would snap it up in a heartbeat I am a sucker for art books and I am still grumpy that this one only a sucker would buy   Boy if you thought the artwork on the book covers was bad this book will make you think again Absolutely awful The book is written from the point of view of a frustrated historian writing a synopsis of the known history through book  Either way this work rather than encompassing the entire series leaves off details from later books and leaves question marks lingering over peoples kingdoms and events that become very well known throughout this world in the course of later books instantly dating EVERYTHING in this book However thats minuscule in comparison to the absolutely atrocious artwork throughout If you were ever even a little repulsed by the evil creatures in the books the laughable representations here will relieve you immensely The main goodguys look worse than the monsters with Thom Merrilyn being particularly evilzombieesque in appearanceRead the books maybe take this one out of the library to check out some Aiel back story if you need to but skip it completely otherwise   First of all I expect better editing out of a professional publishing house much less one of the Big Five All of Gertrude Steins rejected commas appear to have found a home in this book At one point thai is used in place of that Then theres this sentence The Red Ajah the largest is led by a single woman who wields a great deal of power both within her Ajah Both within her Ajah and  I mean you can reasonably guess if you know anything about the series but still bro finish your sentence Second how about a little consistency in the art Cairhien is described as being laid out in a perfect square    a map of it which clearly shows it as a rectangle The banner of Arad Doman is described as a sword point down on field of green and blue stripes Directly beside that text is a picture of the banner with a sword point up on a field of green and ivory stripes There are two images of Callandor which are almost but not quite entirely unlike one another Mayenes banner A golden hawk in flight on a field of blue and by golden we mean redLast but not least its a bit disappointing when it comes to the content It is nice to have the information organized for reference and there is some additional data expanding upon what is already known from the main books However there is a known and reasonable fan expectation that there will some new material in these sorts of supplementary books frequently in the form of illustrations Astonishingly despite the fact that the series sometimes reads like medieval Vogue there was a complete failure to include illustrations of the meticulously described traditional garments of the various regions and factions If I had paid  for this I would be pissed With that said if I can find it used I might buy it because it is terribly nice to be able to look at all the information on Belal on a specific page in one book instead of searching for his name somewhere in  books with  to  pages each Then again there is also The Wheel of Time Companion The People Places and History of the Bestselling Series and it may turn out much better than this   "},

One Or so it is saidThe city that greets AlLan Mandragoran exiled king of Malkier and the finest swordsman of his generation is instead one that is rife with rumour and the whisperings of Shadowspawn Proof should he have required it that the Dark One grows powerful once more and that his minions are at work throughout the landsAnd yet it is within Canluums walls that Lan will meet a woman who will shape his destiny Moiraine is a young and powerful Aes Sedai who has journeyed to the city in search of a bondsman She requires aid in a desperate quest to prove the truth of a vague and largely discredited prophecyone that speaks of a means to turn back the shadow and of a child who may be the dragon reborn Sometimes I feel like reading fantasy is just a waste of time If nothing else the themes are often distressingly adolescent and no matter how many times I read about slaying dragons its pretty unlikely that Ill ever slay a dragon in real lifePerhaps for me the real attraction that sword  sorcery offers is an escape into a world of imagination It sounds like a corny movie trailer Im sure everyone can hear the movie trailer voice when reading esCApe into a worlld  of imagiNAtion but I guess its trueSome fantasy authors manage to create amazing atmospheres without the encyclopedia details  China Mievilles Bas Lag books and Gene Wolfes Solar Cycle come to mind Others take the encyclopedia routeOf the encyclopediasts one of my favorites is Robert JordanSay what you like about Jordans writing  seriously go ahead  The Wheel of Time series stands out for its highly detailed world buildingAnd New Spring does a fine job of representing Jordans worldbuilding skillsPublished after Path of Daggers book  New Spring is a prequel Book  to the regular series None of the major protagonists  not Rand not Mat not Perrin not Elayne not Nynaeve not Egwene not Faile not Loial not Ishmael not Min  are present Instead Jordan tells the story of how Moiraine met Lan  if youre thinking When Harry Met Sally youre way offIt seems that the Black Ajah has begun hunting for the Dragon Reborn Will Moiraine beat them to the finish lineNew Spring is an enjoyable entry in The Wheel of Time and I dont think its the uncertainty Moiraine feels as she tries to impress her peers or Lan fighting off six countem six swordsman that makes this entry stand out Rather its the world that Jordan created that allows this novella to capture our imaginationAfter all New Spring was published at a time when The Wheel of Time had become almost hopelessly bogged down in ongoing  ongoing  plots and a phone books worth of supporting characters Freed of all this baggage New Spring makes the WOT feel fun againI once read that Jordan had begun to make plans for a second fantasy series after hed finished with the Wheel of Time and its quite saddening that he passed away before he was able to start it I sometimes wonder if he resented having to finish The Wheel of Time before he could move on to a new worldRegardless Jordans writing may suffer from any number of obsessive writing disorders but when Im stuck in traffic I am grateful that Ive taken the time to read fantasy and The Wheel of Time   The plot of this book can be summarized in the following two sentences Moiraine and Siuan Sanche learn a great secret while still being Accepted in the White Tower Moiraine meets Lan There are much more than these events in the prequel and some more familiar faces appear than the ones I already mentionedI gave this book  stars initially but I was sure I would lower the rating to  stars after I read this tale for the second time To my complete surprise I realized that is still worth  stars I think the good prequels must show how some of the relationship already developed in the main storyline came to be and some insights on their development In this regard the book succeeds  no questions about it It also happened to have interesting and fastmoving in the second half of the book plotThe first half of the book is mostly spent on Moiraine and Siuan Sanche training in the White Tower While this part is somewhat slower I still find it interesting I always wondered what the test for full Aes Sedai looks like we are shown test for Accepted from both Nynaeve and Egwene POV but never the former This book gives Moiraines POV during this test as well as preparation for itRobert Jordan once again showed his strength as a worldbuilder he gave interesting glimpses of Malkieri culture original and unique in the first ten books Lan was the only Malkieri we get to seeThe prequel totally deserves  stars as it completely fulfills its purpose while being interesting One last piece of advice the book contains minor spoilers it is better to read it in publication order after book  This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one httpgenebooklikescompost   I read the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan because both my husband and best friend had read them The best friend highly encouraged me to read the books  my husband warned me offThe warning is not because the books are bad The first few actually are very good Great character development interesting universe for those who love fantasy novelsThe warning is because these books never ever ever are going to end EverThere are so far  books including a prequel that came out somewhere between books  and  Each book is close to  pages I think the last six books have taken place over the book plot timeline of about a month Seriously One or two books may have only covered a day or two No lieThe books start off with just  main charactersbut over time I think there become closer to  And everyone rates their own storyline As the books stand now I think almost everyone is in a completely different country on a different mission It can get confusing for those not quite looking for that sort of depthNonethelessonce you get far enough in the series youll keep going If for no other reason than you feel obligated At this point all those of us whove kept us are just praying that Robert Jordan doesnt die before finishing the series because there are so many plot lines left untied For those serious about fantasy fiction these books are somewhat of a right of passage A necessary evil   Prequel New Spring a short book written after book ten in the Wheel of Time series is the story of how Moiraine Damodred and Siuan Sanche became Aes Sedai It also relates how Lan Mandragoran met Moiraine It explains why they decided to find the Dragon Reborn I have finished the entire series and I can say reading this book out of order will not hurt a readers enjoyment of the main series at all It does fill in some history However the reader will not find this novel as exciting as the official first book The Dragon Reborn In all honesty if I had read New Spring first I may have not continued with the series Reading it out of order as I did though I liked it and it was interesting as a backstory   Throughout the series the Two Rivers folk are emphasized more than any others which makes sense because they are extremely important However Moiraine and Lan are extremely important as well Without Moiraine the Two Rivers folk never would have left the Two Rivers and even worse Rand wouldnt have been given his chance to save the world as the Dragon Reborn Moiraine and Lan are crucial to the Wheel of Time storyline and reading about their beginnings helped me to respect them so much more They are strong good people people of noble birth who are willing to dedicate their lives to saving the worldIt was also fun reading about the relationship between Suian and Moiraine All the Aes Sedai nonsense of being completely calm at all times gets on my nerves at times its refreshing to be reminded that they really do have emotions and real stable relationships Moiraine and Suian may have been giggly Accepted while in the Tower but later on they become the epitomy of Aes Sedaibut they are more dedicated to their causes rather than their titles Suian and Moiraine both made something of themselves and I dont think the world could have made it to the Last Battle without themAnd you cant forget Lan in all of this It still seems strange to me that he allowed Moiraine to bond him to some it may have seemed like he abandoned all of his duties as the uncrowned king of Malkier when he gave in to Moiraines leadership But Lan is a wise young man and he knows where his skills and influence will have the most effect Lan is a quiet steady and strong force for good a person the Light needs desperatelyThese three characters Moiraine Suian and Lan are fast becoming some of my most favorite characters Two of them may be coniving Aes Sedai but each is dedicated to the greater good no matter what the costs And more importantly each comes with his or her own set of personalities and skills These are real relatable and strong characters that readers cant help but trust With those three to guide the youngesters the world will be in good hands I think the end of this cycle will be more glorious than any other turn of the Wheel because when this Age fades into a new age the world will be a better place than it ever has been No one is going to have to rectify the mistakes of past lives the next leaders wont have to overcome the horrors of their past Instead they will get to start off with a good beginning   "},

LiteratureCrossroads of Twilight was maddening I read it years ago and ended up giving up on The Wheel of Time after this book I tried again in my preparation for reading Memory of Light and I just couldnt manage to do it again So as with Winters Heart I cheated by reading many of the chapter summaries at Encyclopaedia WOT I skimmed the chapters involving Perrins hunt for Faile because I remembered how slow grueling and painful they were when I read them the first time And even though about  of the novel was about this storyline it did not advance at all I also skimmed a lot of Elaynes campaigning and dealing with the constantly whining Sea Folk because not much happened here either There were only two chapters out of  from Rands point of view Mat was entertaining but he didnt get anywhere eitherIn Crossroads of Twilight expect more politicking planning negotiating committee discussions bathing dressing shopping and description of tapestries and seating arrangements than action THE PLOT DOES NOT MOVE There were very few significant occurrences  mostly the characters just talked to themselves and others Only one major event happened and that occurred in the last  minutes on audioHere is a sample of some of the pulsepounding action youll encounter in Crossroads of TwilightI see Egwene said slowly She realized she was massaging the side of her head The throb

half inch to the left then slid it backRiveting But at least we didnt have to hear about Nynaeves braidThere are  characters in The Wheel of Time and its impossible for anyone whos not writing a dissertation on the series to keep them all straight It doesnt help that so many of the names are similar either At this point many of them are all just a big jumble and you have to use a resource like Encyclopaedia WOT who have all  characters listed described and tracked to even begin to understand all of the politicking It also doesnt help that Jordan made occasional mistakes along the way nicely pointed out by Encyclopaedia WOTIf it werent for Brandon Sandersons finale I would absolutely give up at this point I did once By the way let me say here and now March  for the record that I dont believe Mr Sanderson will be able to clean up this mess with only one volume Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at    I really need to mention the reason for my rating of the book it is a strange one The only reason I gave this book  stars and not  which it deserves more is that I never reread the books I rate with  stars while I just finished rereading this one I mentioned  star rating as a big series fanWhat exactly happened during  pages Absolutely nothing that is what Another big part of the frustration comes from the fact that the previous book ended with a grand event which would surely change the history of the whole world and already changed the power picture among the major players including the remaining Forsaken Speaking of whom I would love to see a POV from any of these just to know how the said event affected them but it was the first book in a long time which did not have a POV of any of the ForsakenWhat remain are mostly  subplots which dragged on and on Mat was the first guy with such subplot His POV was mildly amusing but nothing of note happened with him or people around him He is stuck in a traveling circus and tries to balance his ragtag team with practically everybody doing the things their own wayPerrins POV is the most dreadfully boring one He broods nonstop and does not do much except this I did not suspect in the beginning of the series this guy would need Faile as a wet nurse every single moment and would fall completely apart without her If I ever get around reading this book again this is the part I will skipElayne still tries to keep the throne while keeping even her more colorful group under some resemblance of control Aes Sedai the Wise Ones the Kin and last but most definitely not least the Sea Folks Egwene comes next with her rebel Aes Sedai group This part is pure about intrigues and doublecrossings with nothing being done Well not exactly The bad guys keep killing people in the group left and right but these seemingly good Aes Sedai are too busy scheming to look for a killerThere were several good parts but they were few and between The only plot movement worth noticing came at the very end of the book Egwene The most interesting development happened to be in the White Tower of all the places It did not move the overall plot by much but was quite satisfying nonethelessThe last thing which needs to be mentioned Robert Jordan is one of the greatest worldbuilders in fantasy It can be clearly seen from the episode where Perrin visited a town to buy supplies this town gave me creeps The atmosphere people and unexplained happenings were great This was the best part of otherwise completely hopeless Perrins subplotThis is without a doubt the slowest book of the series I am happy to say that at least  of the subplots which were dragging during several books will be resolved in the next installment of the seriesThis review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one httpgenebooklikescompost   I will keep this short In this book absolutely nothing happens There is no character development There is no plot Instead the reader who has so generously given Robert Jordan so much of hisher money over the course of the series is treated to descriptions of dresses of characters whom we dont care about and who have no actual bearing on the plot My advice to those slogging through this series Read the last ten pages of this book and then continue on to Knife of Dreams a flawed book but at least one where something happens Then if youre a truly charitable individual go to your local bookshop buy all the copies and burn them so that nobody will have to be subjected to this utter shit    "},

"text": "Since  when Robert Jordans The Wheel of Time burst on the world with its first book The Eye of the World readers have been anticipating the final scenes of this extraordinary saga which has sold over forty million copies in over thirty languagesWhen Robert Jordan died in  all feared that these concluding scenes would never be written But working from notes and partials left by Jordan established fantasy writer Brandon Sanderson stepped in to complete the masterwork With The Gathering Storm Book  and Towers of Midnight Book  behind him both of which were   New York Times hardcover bestsellers Sanderson now recreates the vision that Robert Jordan left behindEdited by Jordans widow who edited all of Jordans books A Memory of Light will delight enthrall and deeply satisfy all of Jordans legions of readersThe Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and passWhat was what will be and what ismay yet fall under the ShadowLet the Dragon ride again on the winds of time A Memory of LightBook  of the Wheel of TimeBy Robert Jordan and Brandon SandersonA Review by Eric AllenThe Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again In one Age called the Third Age by some an Age yet to come an Age long past a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist The wind was not the beginning There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time But it was a beginningTwentytwo years ago I was captivated by these words They reached off of the page and grabbed me pulling me into a world so vivid so real that it seems as though I should be able to visit it on my next vacation It was a long book for an eleven year old to read but read it I did and have many times since both awaiting and dreading this day The day when The Wheel of Time came to an end It is hard to say exactly how I feel about such a thing I have spent two thirds of my entire life wishing that this series would never end but at the same time dying to read its conclusion And now as I look to tomorrow for the first time since my childhood I no longer have a Wheel of Time book to look forward to Everything that begins inevitably has an end and The Wheel of Time is no exception It is over It is done It has come to an end And oh what an end it wasWhen Robert Jordan died I felt as though Id lost a good friend The two of us had never met nor had we ever spoken but I feel that I knew him The books that he left behind are full of his personality his humor his views on the world His books have brought me together to meet some of my dearest friends and have influenced my career choices Jordan and The Wheel of Time have had a huge impact on my life I was apprehensive of any author taking the helm and finishing the story in his absence You dont just replace an old friend with a shiny new one like nothing has happened However Brandon Sanderson while not perfect has exceeded my expectations in finishing these final volumes I am grateful to him for taking the time and the effort to do the absolute best that he was capable of doing to make these books as good as they have turned outI dont even know how to describe this book I just dont know the words for it Epic is so overused these days that it has almost become meaningless Exquisite maybe No no that sounds like Im plagiarizing the book Glorious Ill go with that one This book is glorious It is magnificent It is the culmination of a fourteen book series that has spanned across twentytwo years of my life and its end left me tearyeyed and speechless I like to avoid saying that a book is the best that I have ever read because such generalizations are usually rather silly Not to mention the fact that without the thirteen books that come before this one to build such a firm solid foundation for it A Memory of Light is rather meaningless on its own However within my alltime favorite book series this one has become my favorite book and it is one of the most spectacular endings to any story I have ever had the pleasure to read A Memory of Light is the Last Battle Tarmon Gaidon in all its glory and terrible splendor Supporting characters bite it by the dozens in ridiculously heroic ways the world comes inches from destruction balancing upon the choices of a single man Rand Althor Trollocs have flooded out of the Blight laying entire nations to waste and the combined forces of the Light meet them on all fronts but when Demandred arrives in the thick of battle leading the combined might of Shara they are forced into retreat Everything falls upon Mat Cauthon the only general remaining on the field He gathers everything to the Fields of Merrilor for a last desperate stand against the forces of the Shadow There is no retreat There is victory or there is death Men women children the elderly everyone who can hold a weapon fight or help in any way flocks to his banners to defend the world from the oncoming tide of oblivion as Mat plays the greatest game of his life He matches his skills as a general against those of Demandred the greatest general that the Shadow has ever had to offer Outnumbered four to one Mats only hope lies in his luck and in the timely arrival of the Horn of Valere Demandred rants and raves shouting for Rand to show himself and fight and many champions of the Light throw themselves against him seeking to behead the beast the seeming only chance of victory only to fall to his blade Characters begin dropping left and right some of them I expected but others came as a complete shock to meMeanwhile at Shayol Ghul Rodel Ituralde and his army defend the mountain as Rand goes inside to face the Dark One himself bringing Moiraine and Nyneave with him Close to the Dark One time changes and mere hours stretch into weeks on the outside as the forces of the Light are pounded nearly to submission He and the Dark One struggle against one another a mere mortal standing up to a universal force and finally coming to the realization of what his purpose in the grand scheme of things has always beenIn the end triumph over the Shadow can only be bought at the price of hundreds of thousands of brave heroic lives For even if Rand succeeds the armies of the enemy still threaten the worldThe Good This book is all battles characters dying heroic deaths doing things that are ridiculously awesome and generally blowing up just about everything Normally a book that was all action and not much else would be a bad thing But the thing is The Wheel of Time has earned this ending It has earned the right to give us nothing but action for an entire book through thirteen previous books building up to this point One could say that the entire book is in and of itself just one gigantic explosive climax though it does still have a narrative and build to a glorious climax all of its own Even now at the end characters still show that they can learn grow and develop as people Rand Egwene Perrin Mat Pevara Logain and even Olver all have very satisfying character growth throughout the fightThis book is exquisitely written Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job of filling in for Robert Jordan I cannot thank him enough for working so hard to complete these final three volumes as well as he did It is true that Sandersons grasp of military tactics is not as keen as Jordans were and so he did something brilliant He didnt focus on the tactics as Jordan likely would have He focused on the characters instead and that more than fills in his lack of experience with arraying armies and the like I found myself cheering out loud in many places and getting choked up at others It was hard to see characters that I have grown up with dying by the handfuls but the things that they did and the feats that they accomplished were such a fitting end to them This entire book was pure unadulterated fan service from page one to the end It was the payoff for all of our faithful reading and waiting Everything you ever wanted to see happen in a Wheel of Time book does and more Almost every single character that has played more than a bit role in the series and is still alive at this point did something heroic No one was left out Everyone was the hero even nameless faceless farmers who took up weapons to fight And I really liked that The Bad There is only one teeny tiny nitpick I have about this book A few of the early battles in the book before Mats last stand do get a little repetitive and some people may find them to be a little boring because of it But once the true last battle begins I promise you you will be riveted and completely unable to force yourself to put it downThis was a glorious climax to a glorious series It was worth the wait It was worth the books in the middle of the series where the story slowed down and focused more on politics It was even worth slogging through    I really just dont even know how to tell you how good this book was If youve made it this far in the series you will not be disappointed It is one of the most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever had the pleasure to witness and I thank God that I ever picked up the first book all those years ago for itA Memory of Light Its such a fitting title Even more so considering the authors untimely demise So long as there is light in the world we the fans will never forget James Oliver Rigney Jr sir though you and I never met I would like to think that we might have been friends if we had Thank you my friend for everything May the light shine forever upon you and yours Though you are gone from this world your memory remains as does your legacy May they never fade or falter Goodbye Check out my other reviewsRobert Jordan was the pen name used by James Oliver Rigney JrAlso some time ago Brandon Sanderson ran a charity fundraiser For a mere ten dollars a person could have their name and general description entered into a drawing These names would be pulled out whenever Sanderson needed to give a character a name He would try to work in the persons description as much as possible and change the persons name to fit within the world of The Wheel of Time Much to my surprise and childlike glee my name was drawn the very day that I entered it In the chapter titled The Last Battle on page  a little more than halfway down you will find a character named Allin being yelled at by Uno who shares my general description Thats where I was used Amongst the best ten bucks that Ive ever spent I think   I started reading this series when I was Today at  I managed to get a copy off my friend a day early I got it just after work and Ive had a few hours to myself Its midnight and I havent stopped reading Im sure Ill have to blog about the immensity of this series and what its meant to me once Im done but for now I just wanted to give a quick spoilerfree update this book is essentially a  page battle sequence involving dozens of characters and spanning an entire worldI have two main reactions to this though Im only halfway through The first is courtesy of yearold me reaching through time and space to say HOLY SHIT THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME FUCK YEAHThe second is the slightly more measured yearold student of writing who is quite simply in awe of this staggering achievement this colossal work of art woven of so many delicate strands The level of detail the timing the pacing to bring it to this pointHOLY SHIT THIS IS FUCKING AWESOMERobert Jordan you magnificent bastard I love youEDIT I finished the book a few hours ago Im so very glad that I was able to use work as a means to extend the reading experience beyond one burnedout marathon This way over two and a half days I was able to space it out and luxuriate in it If ever there was a book to be savoured it is this one It was for me the greatest storytelling experience Ive ever had and likely will ever have Three decades in the making twelve years in the reading such an astonishing journey It defies belief How with such astronomical expectations was it pulled offI dont know Likely I never will and Im not sure I even want to  some mysteries are necessary My reactions in case youre wondering are the same at the end as they were midway through And okay yes there were some tears it wasnt all manly exclamations but so what Lastly A Silence Like Screaming remains my favourite chapter title ever Wonderful wonderful stuff   Why I believe  is actually the endIll apologize up front this may be a little insensitive but its all in the name of entertainment so that makes everything okay At least thats what the television show Family Guy tells meYou may have heard that according to the Mayans among others long count calendar  is the end date  more specifically December   Many have interpreted this to mean that this is the end of the world thats been predicted I never put much weight on it until recentlyYou know what I believe it all nowHeres why and it has to do with The Wheel of Time Weve just been told that the release date has been set and that date is January   I dont think thats meant to happenFirst The Wheel of Time has been delayed over and over again What was meant to be a three book series has turned into  A series thats been  years in the makingThen and much to everyones surprise and great sadness Robert Jordan is diagnosed with a rare disease and dies in Another few years later we see the series resurrected with Brandon Sanderson at the helm Things are going well and then the artist whos done every cover since the beginning of the series Darrell K Sweet dies in  The SFF community lost two of its greats and both connected to this seriesAn ending to The Wheel of Time is not meant to be Do yourself a favor dont even try to finish this series No ones getting out of it alive With the  phenomenon and the tragic occurences that have marked this series the coincidences are much too real   Like the unfettered dawn shall he blind us and burn us yet shall the Dragon Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle and his blood shall give us the Light Let tears flow O ye people of the world Weep for your salvationIn the depths of the Blight the armies of the Dark One are marshalling their power In the Westlands Rand alThor and his allies are preparing for the coming storm The Last Battle looms above all and the Dragon Reborn prepares to face the full strength of Shaitan and defeat the Shadow one last timeI must admit something that might come as a shock to most of you When I finished A Memory of Light it was probably my least favourite Wheel of Time book And that is not simply because the series ends here or because I was unhappy with how things turned out though I was It was for a variety of reasonsNow I had written two long paragraphs where I heavily criticised the book for those reasons Partly because I now disagree with myself and partly because I choose to ignore the books flaws those paragraphs have now mysteriously disappeared never to be seen again Suffice it to say that the book could have finished off in a better way but that what we have is satisfying enoughAnd of course this is Wheel of Time I dont really care about what I didnt like I want to talk about what I loved insteadSo why was this a satisfying conclusion There are seven reasons for that four or which are scenes or details in the book The fifth is the best title of any fantasy book ever The sixth is the fact that this is a Wheel of Time book and despite some minor disappointment this is the ending to my favourite fantasy series of all time The seventh is the fact that this is another of those books that I just love more and more for each moment that passes after having finished itAs for those four scenes one is Rands gathering of all the factions and nations of the world early in the book simply because of the arrival of one single very important character The other three are in the epilogue And the epilogue the only chapter in the book to be written singlehandedly by Robert Jordan is the crowning glory of A Memory of Light and one of the best chapters in the whole series It contains arguably the most emotional scene in the series It contains an absodamnlutely perfect ending paragraph which makes you think But of course it ends like that And after said paragraph it contains a repetition of my favourite nonTolkien fantasy quote I am eternally grateful to Jordan for using that quote to end the series and I will also use it to end my last Wheel of Time review     I was criticized for giving this five stars before it came out  Which I suppose I can understand since it slightly affects the average scoreWell Ive read it now and Sanderson did not disappoint I loved the final volume of this superepic even though getting to the end was bittersweetTo review this book is to review the entire series The bottom line is that while it has some low points Crossroads of Twilight even those have some pretty neat moments I always cheered when I heard the book count was going UP because I loved immersing myself in Robert Jordans worldWhen Sanderson picks up the reigns in The Gathering Storm the pace picks up dramatically and the more tiresome subplots are wrapped up very quickly   "},

Winters Heart gets three stars since its the weakest Wheel of Time book Ive read so far alongside The Path of Daggers However that doesnt mean it really deserves three stars This put me in a difficult situation because this rating is in comparison with the other WoT books On the other hand it is quite a lot better than several books Ive rated four starsThe problem with this one is one you probably know about The plot development is gone Still I absodamnlutely love this world this writing and some of these charactersI dont think there is any more for me to say This is book  after all                                              This is one of the hardest books to rate I thought long and hard whether to give this book  or  stars I also could not take an easy path and give this book  stars more on this laterPerrins subplot takes up the first quarter of the book Perrin spends his time brooding and being miserable To be fair he comes to his senses from time to time when he does he makes pointless talk He also snaps at the people who really try to help him It is really sad to see a pathetic human being which Faile made out of him In her absence he runs around like a headless chicken somehow forgetting he has a ragtag army which entirely depends on him Well tough luck guys and girls you commander is too preoccupied with his personal problems to care about you any To make a long story short this part is painful to readTo be completely fair that first quarter of the book I mentioned also contained a prolog which was relatively short by the series standards It contains  among other things  an interesting announcement by RandElaynes plotline comes next Despite the fact that her plot moves in exactly the same direction as Perrins nowhere her part is really refreshing to read after his These two occupy first half of the book One thing of note in here Nynaeve finally becomes very useful she is forced into this but she really does her best Basically this is the book where she grows from the most annoying character into one of the most awesomeThe second half of the book finally gets back to Mat it took Jordan long enough considering the fact that the guy was not in the previous book Mats subplot is uneven very interesting and exciting parts follow by complete screeching halt and vice versa At least the slow parts in his case are justifiable as he is currently in situation where he cannot do much if anything at all his frustration is clearly shownRands part comes last and while it has its occasional boring parts on the hole this last part of the book gives adrenaline rush to its readers The end of the book is up there with Dumais Wells from book  it moves the overall plot forward by a long stretch and really make big power shift especially among the ForsakenAs I mentioned Mats parts really save this book from  star rating Rands grand finale gives it at least very strong  stars As to  stars it really depends on whether you think the excitement of Rands part overcomes Perrins nonstop brooding If so the final rating is  stars otherwise it is  I still think Rands actions and resulting power shift warrants higher rating This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one httpgenebooklikescompost   s for this book and thats mostly due to the ending of it which is rather epic in proportion I really enjoyed listening to this instalment of WoT and I felt that there were a few things we really gained knowledge of in this volume As I have mentioned in previous reviews this series has recently made the transition form a cast of teens into a cast of adults and this is clear from the vast array of choices made by some of our major players and the way that their previous experiences are now informing these decisionsElayne and Aviendha both really grow as characters within this book but especially Elayne who is a far more interesting and exciting character now than she was just a few books earlier In this section Elayne is concerned with a large amount of threats and tough choices which she most certainly wouldnt have been able to cope with until this point in her plot Whilst I have never disliked Elayne particularly I do know that some people really do and that this is largely due to the way she was in previous books and the fact that she had yet to grow into her role I feel now that not only her storyline has become far more exiting and intriguing but shes a strong leader and a very competent women overall and although this is not going to solve all of her problems shes certainly more well equipped than previouslyEgwene is one of my favourite characters still but we dont see too much of her story within this volume which was a slight shame I felt that there was opportunity for her story to be expanded a bit further than it was but still she remains in firm control of the situation shes in and even with constant worries and threats all around shes calm and reassuring Mats storyline is picked back up in the later sections of this book and I found that I really enjoyed his story a lot more in this volume than any of the others I felt that he was starting to weigh his decisions better and making a few plans and back ups rather than just hoping or relying on luck I think hes certainly started to become a very intriguing character and his plot promises more to come in the next book for sure because of the way things are left I also felt that the incidents where he encounters some of the rather horrific beasts in WoT were well handled and although hes quite lucky by design his lucky streak didnt allow him to dodge all danger and he still needed to use hit head and his wits to get byRand is quite the crazy epic hero in this volume with some gallivanting around and then some wonderfully big events happening towards the end of the book As always his plans are slow to reveal themselves to us and he seems a little flighty and led by emotion at some parts of this story rather than by his head but hes still young and thats something that is easy to forget when we see that craziness hes often up against I very much enjoyed the scene between himself Min Elayne and Aviendha Im sure if you have read this then you know which I mean and the implications and consequences which were set in motion by their meeting and I also was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen as everything intensified towards the end of this book and the drama was really nailbiting at pointsCadsuannes plans and her intentions are certainly explained a little more in this book and we get to see a bit more about how she plans everything and the level to which she will go in order to achieve what she believes she needs to I think I do like her character because she is a bit on an enigma and she does things quite differently to many of the other Aes Sedi yet still shes very traditional and demands respect when it comes to some other areas I think there were a few situations between her and Rand within this book and the previous one where things could have been handled better by both of them but it all seems to be a part of her overall plan somehow and even when she seems like shes lost she never panics Nynaeve goes through a few significant things in this book to do with the power and the people around her She has to deal not only with the Windfinders and the Ship Captains but she also has to later meet with Rand and goes through a rather large ordeal with him She didnt progress too much in terms of her character but she was certainly given a few moments where she had to pause and consider things and for a fiery lady such as she that was fairly humorous Perrin and Faile are mentioned in the first half of this book and particularly Failes story has some very interesting plots which are beginning to emerge However at the moment her storyline and Perrins storylines are both fairly separated from the other events of the world and what we see of them doesnt progress the main storyline too much I did very much like the look deeper into the Aiel when it concerned Faile and I thought that the story there was informative as well as filled with threats plots mystery and intrigue I will certainly keep watch to see where it goes from here onwardsFinally seeing a bit more from the POV of the Forsaken is always interesting and although we dont see a huge amount from each of them the recaps we do get keep us knowing whos still in the game and what their personalities are like I thought this was excellently inserted especially towards the end and really added a feeling of danger to the story so I anticipate more of this as the story goes forwardOverall the climax of this book was really exciting and I have to say it was not far from a  rating I think that this is a slow volume in places but the events which take place within are all important and certainly make me wonder about what will happen as I enter the last few books in the series Id certainly say this is a very good book if you like the others in the series and as always let me know if you agreedisagree with all I have said D   Im Rand AlThor and Im in love with three different women In a good story I would have to make a hard choice lose two women I loved and possibly gain one devoted loverwifeconfidant In a move straight out of Love Hina I refuse to make a decision and am rewarded by not one but all three beautiful yet exotically different women desperate to bear my childrenThe only instance I can think of where more than one woman is nice for any length of time to a man in the entire WoT series occurs in this bookA good plot thread would have been if Rand had made no decision and then been punished by all three women saying the hell with this Way more believable and also more consistent considering that all the women in this series are horrible manhating serpents   Worried that the series is slowing down to a crawl after the first two thirds of The Path of Daggers and wondering if Winters Heart is worth it Let me start with a resounding YESLike most people I too was a bit sceptical after The Path of Daggers since frankly until the last third of the book not very much happens and were given the two most annoying POVs quite a lot of the time Faile and Nynaeve Fortunately Winters Heart completely breaks away from that and I didnt feel like there was a single dull moment in the whole book Overall a lot more happens and even when the book is dealing with side events they dont feel at all like fillerTheres much more Mat in this one which leads to a lot of information on Seanchan society and customs along with something I was expecting for AGES view spoiler Mat finally meeting the Daughter of the Nine Moons   His POV is always entertaining and were also rewarded with recurring characters we hadnt seen in a whileFor once Faile is actually bearable and I loved what weve seen of her even if did leave me wanting moreThe Wheel of Time is known for amazing climaxes but I must say the last few pages of Winters Heart are definitely some of the best in the series This is exactly why I read these books and thankfully I didnt have to go through some  pages of pure boredom to get it which made for an amazing ride I literally lost count of how many times I opened my mouth in cheer awe at the lots of twists in the book Theyre spaced apart just right that it doesnt feel like were being bombarded but enough that the whole experience flows incredibly wellOverall this was probably the most enjoyable book in the series It had a lot of plot development a new city a lot of plot twists that had been in the process of setting up for several books enjoyable side events a lot of information on the Seanchan and an absolutely explosive in a multitude of ways ending I loved itThe pacing is meant to slow down again in Crossroads of Twilight but if youve read The Path of Daggers chances are youre already invested enough in the series anyway and you definitely wont be disappointed with Winters Heartbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   "},

my last Robert Jordan book in a while And a great one it was I didnt quite feel that it was on the level of the early great ones like The Eye of the World The Shadow Rising and Lord of Chaos but it definitely takes the pace up after three almost disappointingly mediocre booksIn Knife of Dreams interesting things start happening again and we start moving towards a conclusion Im in doubt whether thats actually a positive thing seeing as that means this all has to endNow its up to Brandon Sanderson to determine whether this series will pass A Song of Ice and Fire as my second favourite fantasy                                              This book feels like a rollercoaster ride after the last book The action began right in the first pages of prolog Galad and Whitecloaks subplot Things moves much closer to the Last Battle three of the most annoying subplots which dragged on and on during the last three books were finally resolved Perrin Elayne and Mat Below are my thoughts about the major characters of the series and their developmentRand shows up fairly briefly one of the prophesies about him is finally fulfilled  I am talking about Mins viewing the first time she meets him in the first book Her viewing about Perrin was fulfilled a long time ago and the one about Mat has not happened yet The ones about Rand and Mat felt like nasty one and in case of Rand it really was a bad one Poor guy cannot catch any breaks looks like he also slowly goes madMat finally returns to being awesome His annoying subplot yes I used the words Mat and annoying in the same sentence was finally resolved and in this book and it was fairly exciting with somewhat surprising if expected conclusionI would give this book  stars even if it contained nothing else but a closure of a torture called Perrin Sent to Bring Mazema to the Dragon Reborn This piece was largely responsible for the last book being extremely slow It dragged during the last three books but it started even earlier in book  When you think about it imagine a guy with a small army being stuck between Shaido Aiel Seanchan invasion and halfmad Dragon Prophet how can this be boring The answer is it can and it actually is This part is also responsible for this book losing one star from its rating as the subplot is still slow To be fair I need to mention the last battle was exciting but it was overshadowed by my huge sense of relief that this was finally overElayne managed to achieve something she was trying to do for the last  books as well She also managed to kill hundreds of people who were trying to protect her from her own stupidity I really cannot accept her excuse of the type They signed up for this knowing they might die doing this Sorry dear Elayne but when they signed up for this nobody told them you are too stupid to live The less is said about this the betterNynaeve became the character with the most unexpected development She was THE most annoying character in the first  books Who would have thought at that time that she will say and do something which gives people goosebumps just from reading this She actually did and this became one of the most known quotes from the series She does not have a lot of screentime in here but she uses it wellEgwene tries to do the best under the circumstances  she ended up in a very difficult situation in the end of the previous book She looks good if somewhat masochistic You know about enduring punishment until they became tired of giving it This is her approachThis is the last book Robert Jordan wrote before his untimely death We lost one of the best worldbuilder surpassed only by JRR Tolkien I am still sad about him not being able to finish his series as well as never starting on another one he planned for a long timeDear Mr Jordan the fantasy genre had a great loss with your passing Thank you for a wonderful journey in the world which really feels alive with different people with different cultures the world full of mysteries magic lost knowledge and strange ruins and artifacts the world full of violence but still remaining bright and optimistic This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one httpgenebooklikescompost   ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureKnife of Dreams is another huge installment  days worth of audio which suffers the same faults as the last several WOT novels But if youve made it this far perhaps that wont bug youI have to say that Robert Jordan can surely set a scene indeed each chapter begins with a very detailed description of the setting including such minutia as the style and oiliness of mens beards the height of ladies boots every knickknack on every plinth every bit of jewelry worn by each character how much bosom is exposed how tight the pants are etc The reader certainly feels immersed in the setting but for those who have other books they hope to read this year this may be aggravatingBy this point in the series I can no longer keep track of the characters In the chapters about Elayne we find Pelivar high seat of House Coelan and Perival high seat of house Mantear Ack And here are the names of the characters whose names begin with An Anaiya Anaiyella Ananda Anath Andaya Forae Andaya Murasaka Ander Corl Ander Tol Andhilin Andil Andra Andric Andris Andro Androl Genhald Mistress Andscale Anemara Mistress Anford Anghar Angla Anjen Ankaer Anlee Annharid Annoura Larisen Anthelle Sharplyn Antol Anvaere Anya Youll find a list like this for every letter of the alphabet see them at Encyclopaedia WOT Did he expect us to study I feel like I need flashcardsAgain theres so much stuff in Knife of Dreams that weve already heard before eyes a man could drown in rosebud mouth seductive copperskinned domani Aes Sedai dont show emotions but they do Loial sounds like a bumblebee damp bowstrings dont work arms folded beneath breasts unnecessary adjustment of clothes smiles that dont touch eyes Mat worries about his mens influences on Olver wink wink  yeah we got it already I could go on and on and on And dont even get me started on the spanking There was more spanking in Knife of Dreams than any of the previous novels Why are adults spanking each other Its not for fun I rolled my eyes so often I started to worry theyd stickThere was one major redeeming factor here though and thats that the plot actually moves forward in Knife of Dreams There are some big events that occur each surrounded by a lot of fluff I got the impression that after the last book in which nothing happened for  pages Mr Jordan woke up and said oh Light Tarmon Gaidons got to happen in the next book and Ive got to get everyone there and on the same side And so we see that starting to happen  alliances are being made people are getting in position In fact some of it happens much too quickly and easily to be believed eg Egwenes storyline Whitecloak storyline But thats fine with me  lets get this over withSince Knife of Dreams was Robert Jordans last book published before his death let me say that I have enjoyed the world the story and the characters he created  The Wheel of Time is truly epic and I respect Mr Jordans work My complaint is that it became aggravatingly slow and repetitive for the last several novels But I eagerly look forward to finding out how it all endsYoure up Mr SandersonRead more Robert Jordan book reviews at    So before anything else First things first YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS WE ARE OUT OF THE SLUMPPRAISE THE LORD THE BOOK DID ITI DIDNT KNOW IT WOULD FEEL SO GOODBUT IT FELT EVEN BETTER THAN IT WAS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE I HAVE COME OUTTA THE OTHER SIDE STILL ALIVE The sweetness of victory and the bitterness of defeat are alike a knife of dreams  All right let us get down to it Take a few deep breaths before I begin and waste a few characters on how shocked I am The feeling that can be used to described this doesnt exist but I will say a little anecdote Since I am now commencing the BS Trilogy I am also approaching the end of the series Now I am much closer to the internet boom times so there are plenty of videos and articles concerning the last books One of these articles is called A Memory of Light delivers a better ending than Robert Jordan deserves Now this does not relate with this installment but it does well in summarizing how I feel concerning this specific book I was so messed up during the Slump Saga just look at my Crossroads of Twilight and Winters Heart reviews Yet this book turned it around from page  Knife of Dreams has also broken my personal record on how many notes I have written which take up  lines I havent felt this good on a book since the first five in this series but how well do I really like this installment So lets begin and discover the answer to what will definitely be a long review  FastPacing  Do you remember the first five books Do you remember when things occurred in the span of  pages and as you closed the book thought how it was satisfying Because this one does too thanks to its fast pacing and the cutting of tons of fluff Although there are  pages of Elayne POV that could have certainly been cut it out in the  area but the first  pages PURE GOLD  onward PURE GOLD There is infinitely less filler than in previous books It makes me feel as though those damn editors finally sat down and decided to advise RJ what they should advised a while back but now decided enough was enough There was never a point unlike in the Slump Saga where I felt like skipping a chapter Always did I find myself engrossed and amused or tense and excited So thank jesus  The Prologue was good enough to give orgasms  Yes you did read right A problem that occurred often enough in nearly every book before this except the first five books since they were short was that they were too long and too boring It felt perfectly fine to skip a tenth of the book because all of the useless POVs would be shoved into the prologue Here the prologue was  pages and believe me my first thoughts were Oh great yet again I must go through this bullshit However the book began with a bang with Galad VS Eamon Valda But dont think that immediately sold me No it was the fact that the POV was  pages quick and cleanly written slice of greatness For the first time ever a Galad POV was engaging Then we saw an Ituralde POV and I know what that would make you think Oh hell no that dude from the Crossroads of Twilight POV why However again RJ comes on with that bitch slap in the face and shows how Ituralde is an  excellent  and  intelligent  general We are shown this in again a quick and clean slice of greatness where he takes out a score of Seachan Now Ituralde has been developed into this awesome Domani general After Suroth POV where we are revealed shes Darkfriend and developed on Ituralde through her perspective Also SEMIRHAGE Also THE EMPIRE IS DESTROYED Then Tower POVs which before would make me cringe and think DAMMIT But no development and insight into how broken the White Tower is People are afraid of being assaulted or roaming the halls in fear of other ajahs by other  sisters  That is so messed up Then Perrin and Egwene POVs further develop their situations which will be expanded upon in their sections Overall maybe the best Prologue in the series to date  Quick Side notes  At this point some thoughts were how surprised I was that Berelain is a significant part of Perrins POV and just in general how she is still around She has grown much since the beginning of Shadow Rising Next the possibility that there wont be that many new storylines by useless characters Its possibly safe to say that era has ended Also the Sea Folk commit mass suicide WTF When they said at the end of Winters Heart that the age of Illusions had come to an end I did not expect that would be the result Finally Tam alThor cameo which is always nice to see We finally see him discover that Rand is the Dragon Reborn  Elaynes POV  Now her POV wasnt bad but neither was it particularly great It is definitely a significant improvement since previous installments but there is still very little to make Elayne that much of an interesting character I mean I dont really care what happens to her The Civil war storyline was a good storyline to use but it just wasnt that juicy either Thats sort of a problem with her character in general she has very much with Aviendha and Birgitte sort of lost significance to me personally Stone cracks from a hard enough blow Cadsuane said her face an Aes Sedai mask of calm Steel shatters The oak fights the wind and breaks The willow bends where it musts and survives  Rand POV  The worst and the greatest is yet to come for Rand from what I presume and from what I have heard His storyline doesnt close the book as was usual and neither does it lead the book Rand is present and besides the battle at the manor with the excellent Chapter  where we see Loial dogreat stuff Overall he had a good enough presence in the book but this certainly wasnt the Rand Book as it usually is However the following is a good paragraph from a Rand POV  You must be in shock Nynaeve said slowly Youve just suffered a grievous injury Rand Maybe youd better lie down Lord  Perrin POV  Oh Perrin how low you have fallen You used to have interesting POVs but now he is merely a step above Elayne He just doesnt hold that much interest Finally he has regained custody of Faile odd way of saying that Takes out a lot of the Shaido and the Shaido run away Ill mark you down for midday again since I know you have no intention of   Egwene POV  EGWENE Never before have I loved this character as much as I do now In the span of  pages in the greatest chapter of the book and one of the best in the whole series she goes from Elayne level to Rand level The brilliance of Chapter  is multiple factors We see the White Tower on sight and how messed it is Also we see characters establishing their relationship with Egwene Then the brilliance kicks in In the span of  pages we see the White Tower firsthand Egwene is treated like shit by other novices by Accepted and Aes Sedai and she is taking for penance multiple times a day Simultaneously we see her refuse to be broken resilient in pursuing her plans she acts out and refuses to be treated like dog shit Not only is Egwene a strong character in terms of sheer power in Saidar she is a strong enough character to where her presence and demeanor is as strong if not stronger than Siuan Sanche at the beginning of the series We see her at her prime and the best part is seeing the rise and fall of others hostility By the end of the chapter Egwene has made a traitor submit and ask for forgiveness and set her plans in motion we see Egwenes two Aes Sedai guards gain a sort of respect for her and the other novices hold her in awe In fact the other novices go to her for advice on how to go about certain things or help on how to weave something She is winning the war even in her own imprisonment Comparing Elaida and herself she spreads seeds of doubt among the towers residents and makes herself set out more as the True Amyrlin Seat I think Ill keep this as a memento he said rolling the fat gold coin across the back of his fingers  Mat POV  Without a doubt this book is Egwene and Mats book leaning more on Mat He spanks Joline and he discovers that Moiraine is still alive Also that he Thom and one another are the ones who will save her Likely in Towers of Midnight Although I was surprised that the letter to Thom was ALL about Mat Besides We see his relationship with Tuon develop and by the end of the installment Mat is officially married Tuon reminisces on the fact that Mat is in love with her and wonders if she herself can ever be in love So that says that there is still a ways to go before the relationship storyline can be wholly done with them parting ways but still as spouses Also funny how he is technically a noble now even though he has time and time again said how he resents them What do you make of him she asked Karede once they were away from the soldiers and beginning to canter There was no need to  This book does capitalize on Mats development as a character In fact it capitalizes on everyones characters  Partially this book really serves to make one reflect on how far we have come Rand is a stone the Dragon Reborn and not the boy who conflicted with Moiraine when they left the Two Rivers hell he isnt the boy who made Moiraine be his lap dog in The Fires of Heaven Mat isnt the complete goofball who was in denial and acted like a complete dumbass back in the first  books he has found his groove he is the general of the Band of the Red Hand but from duty Mat has gained their respect as a general not through force but by his victories and actions and he still strives to not have to deal with war and to find peace and solace Perrin is not the totally peaceful boy he is a wolf in manshape he does what he has to do no matter what He is suspicious he has plans he has goals and he has ways of getting there but he has also made mistakes as with Aram Egwene isnt the girl who left Two Rivers she is the Amyrlin Seat she is unbreakable and she has a vision she is powerful in saidar and in presence Those are some examples of how far we have come SIDE NOTE Mazrim Taim Who the hell is he really He says that cryptic phrase Let the Lord of Chaos Rule which I think Demandred says HmmmmmIn conclusion Knife of Dreams is a perfect way for RJ to go Thank him for all he has done and the world he has created as well as giving me a huge bitch slap in the face yet again and proving to me making me remember the brilliance in his writing and the pure skill of his storytelling RIP Robert Jordan  FastPaced Best Prologue Yet Transformation of Characters Chapter  Egwene and Mat Climatic Feeling ElayneBUYRENTSKIP BUYFinal Score   Favorite Books from  to last The Great Hunt    Knife of Dreams the elenth book in the colossal fantasy series the Wheel of Time has been viewed as something of a return for Robert Jordan After near unanimous agreement on the terrible quality of books  and particularly book  Crossroads of Twilight an  page novel where literally nothing happens fans and some critics have regarded this as a return to form Are they right Is Knife of Dreams really as good as such earlier volumes as The Dragon Reborn and Lord of Chaos Has it redeemed the series While it certainly marks an improvement I would argue that A Knife of Dreams is a simply mediocre effort and nowhere near on par with the earlier books in the seriesThe key thing that fans seem to be praising about this novel is its pace and indeed the fact that Jordan resolves plotlines that have been festering away for as many as three or four  page novels is a welcome change However there is no question that this book is overlong and that Jordan still maintains the overdescriptive writing style that has destroyed this series enjoyability Jordan spends as usual way too much time describing the clothing of all the characters we meet and more damningly takes up too much page space with unimportant plotlines The worst example of this is Elayne far too much time is spent with such an uninteresting character and Jordans political machinations are both shallow and boring Sections like Elaynes and those of minor charactors whose names you wont remember and who wont have any effect on the actual major plot bring the pace of the book down quite a lot and make it at points a plodding experienceAnd although several plotlines are resolved in this book I cant say that Jordan does it all too well After spending three agonizing books watching Perrin plot to rescue his wife a  page battle in which this is finally done is incredibly anticlimactic and proves that Jordan really just had no idea where to go with the plot Any attempt to tie threads like this in with the overall plot are absent showing that Jordan just needed somewhere convenient for his characters to be while Rand takes his time getting ready for the last battle Similarly when something dramatic finally happens in Rands POV and Im not talking about a certain incredibly dumb battle which pits Rand against a large number of foes it is written so clumsily and is over so quickly that you feel as if Jordan is just writing these scenes so that he can placate the fans and get back to his love of dress descriptionNow on the positive side the pace has increased despite my complaints and anyone whose read Crossroads of Twilight will be thankful for that Although nearly all the women in the series essentially remain one note characters with no likeable or interesting character traits Egwene finally does becomes somehwat likeable after ten books though her plotline is annoying left with not even a cliffhanger Similarly Nynaeve has a touching moment here words I certainly never thought Id hear well read myself saying typing And of course even while nothing of import happens in his plotline until the very end Mat can still fortunately entertain youDespite all these problems there is a more serious issue that has been present in this series since book seven Namely whens it going to end Although Jordan has began resolving plotlines he has also introduced several in this book He promises to only deliver one more book yet without rushing the action even more I find that its simply impossible to resolve all these plotlines within one book On the other hand I am really getting fed up with this never ending story and I want nothing more than for it to finally reach some resolution Itll be interesting to see if he can worm his way out of this with the next and possibly last book of the Wheel of Time A Memory of Light   "},
{"title": "The Path of Daggers",

"author": "Robert Jordan",
"text": "For millions of fans around the globe the wait is over Sequel to the international blockbuster bestseller A Crown of Swords The Path of Daggers continues one of historys greatest fictional

Perrin faces the intrigues of Whitecloaks Seanchan invaders the scattered Shaido Aiel and the Prophet himself Perrins beloved wife Faile may pay with her life and Perrin himself may have to destroy his soul to save herMeanwhile the rebel Aes Sedai under their young Amyrlin Egwene alVere face an army that intends to keep them away from the White Tower But Egwene is determined to unseat the usurper Elaida and reunite the Aes Sedai She does not yet understand the price that othersand she herselfwill pay Usually my reviewing style includes a plot synopsis at the beginning but through experience Ive come to the realisation that its most often a huge advantage when the book actually has a plotThis was essentially Interlude the Book No plot development no character development no setting development no development At all And you dont need to tell me it gets worse I knowThe chapters written from the viewpoint of the main protagonists are downright boring Quite the opposite is true for the chapters written from the viewpoint of minor characters like the Forsaken the Seanchan and the Black Ajah But unfortunately there are so depressingly few of themThen we have people being stupid other people being incomprehensibly stupid the development of what has the potential to be the worst love plot in fantasy and Faile being Faile thats the worst partAnd the only real redeeming quality of the book is called Cadsuane MelaidhrinThe only reason this doesnt get two stars is because its a Wheel of Time book and it allows me to spend more time in this wonderful world But if I were to be objective its definitely closer to two stars than threeAt least I read most of the book in less than twentyfour hours That must count for something Though the book was only  pages which is barely even a novella by Robert Jordans standardsFortunately I still love the series a lot more than when I was reading the first three books And this changes nothing                                              ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureThe best thing I can say about The Path of Daggers is that it is significantly shorter than the last few novels have been  only  pages mass market paperback compared to the  page novels that have preceded it There is much less of the repetitive backstory I guess Mr Jordan finally realized that new readers arent jumping in at this pointHowever thats not to say that there are  pages of plot here either For again most of the pages are devoted to minutia such as nearly every word spoken during one of Elaynes  hour long rides every thought that Perrin has while walking around his camp etc Most of the significant action is squeezed into the last couple of chapters The story is still interesting but The Path of Daggers doesnt advance it far enoughBut whats annoying me most is that the female WOT characters are the cattiest bunch of women Ive ever encountered Supposedly the Aes Sedai are dignified coolheaded and calm but yet we see them constant bickering backbiting squabbling thinking about their positions relative to others and worried about what everyone else is thinking For such powerful women they are continually showing their shock getting into petty disagreements trying to outwit each other widening their eyes adjusting their shawls and smoothing their skirts apparently this is an indication of uneasiness though I have never actually seen an uneasy woman smoothing her skirt And why the heck are adult women SPANKING each otherI find it irritating that women leaders are portrayed this way while the powerful men are portrayed as hard reserved and distinguished Im sure that Mr Jordan meant for his female characters to seem strong but they just come across as bitchy I really cant figure out why they all take each other so seriously Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at    Book  of the Wheel of Time really gets a bad rap Contrary to common wisdom plenty happens in this book The problem I think is that nothing gets resolved Not having any Mat especially after the cliffhanger at the end of book  doesnt help either Is it ridiculous for a fantasy series to still be setting things up  books in Especially when that series was supposed to be  books long OK yeah it is But taken by itself The Path of Daggers isnt a bad storyOddly enough the story begins with an event that could easily have been used instead as a climax in book  It makes some sense for this event to happen in this book however since it has broad implications affecting every other plotline The core plotlines of the book follow Rand and Egwene who Im beginning to notice are actually paired off quite often despite a lack of specific plot crossover I guess that Jordan guy knew what he was planning after allThe biggest issue with book  isnt the fact that it doesnt resolve existing plotlines its that it doesnt resolve the plotlines introduced during the book The stage is set for book  where things mercifully do begin to resolve but the sheer number of cliffhangers in this book is staggering Without going into details the book ends after setting up a siege a succession a betrayal and a capture Add in Mats cliffhanger and thats six times the usual frustration Just be glad you dont need to wait for the next book anymoreAll that said this is an enjoyable and wellwritten story We have epic battles surprise appearances by objects of Power even some amusing light shed on a few relationships But the three Aes Sedairelated stories really take the spotlight here perhaps another reason the book isnt all that popular Egwene finally begins openly asserting her power while Elayne sets into motion significant events on both sides of the world Best of all seemingly minor Aes Sedai begin an important and long overdue witch hunt that is completely satisfyingThere is one particular theme of this book that really changed the series for me I didnt like book  any more than most people the first time I read it but I have since come to actually like the muchmaligned Aes Sedai and the reason starts here So far theyve proven arrogant often incompetent and rarely live up to their reputation When Egwene proposes a major change in their philosophy I think most readers would agree with her However it is at this point that you really begin to respect the Aes Sedai compared to the various other groups of channelers They have been humbled at every turn but they are the ones whove held the world together for  years and thats no coincidence Not only does their fate begin to change here its become increasingly clear that their largest problems arent actually their faultWhat it comes down to is that book  is a lot more palatable now that book  and   and  are readily available Reading a book filled with cliffhangers even if it does have a few holy shit moments is not something you want to do a year before the next one arrives In many ways book  breaks the implied promise of the author that the story will be further along at the end than at the beginning In truth it is but it certainly doesnt feel like it without the context of later events But stick with it because the series is finally hitting its peak and things are about to start changing   We tend to root for most antiheroes but every now and then authors dare to set a real stinker at the centerpiece of their stories Sometimes it worksLogan Mountstewart from William Boyds Any Human Heart comes to mind Henry Millers Tropic of Cancer qualifies I think And before we certify all shepherds as pureatheart heroes check out Halldor Laxnesss Bjartur in Independent PeopleBut these are all examples drawn from the literary canon What happens when fantasy a genre often prone to portraying the righteous struggles of angelic heroes against twisted villains tries to create a real jerk who is also supposed to be not only a hero but a saviorWell that should be pretty interestingBelieve it or not Ive heard people complain that they abandoned The Wheel of Time because Rand alThor became a jerk To be honest Robert Jordan has laid extensive groundwork in order to prepare his audience for Rands corruption of character He is tainted he hears voices and there is tangible evil literally festering in his stomach But Rand is also the Dragon RebornIts a conflict that comes to a head in eighth book Path of DaggarsHaving just won Illians crown Rand launches a counter attack on the invading Seanchan forces that have taken over the southwest corner of Randland By now Rand has conquered a considerable amount of territory but his prophesied mandate is to unite as many countries as he can before he attacks the Dark Ones prison in the Blight Unfortunately its easier to defeat a Forsaken than it is to gain legitimate and stable authority over conquered territories Chosen One or not Rand is surrounded by vassals that plot against himDiabolically Rand not only launches his invasion of Seanchan territory but also surrounds himself with his most powerful enemies Rand is sacrificing lives that indirectly serve him in order to weaken the nobles these soldiers directly strengthen If nothing else this is an unusual play for a fantasy author and I have encountered more than one fellow WOT fan that couldnt take itTo some extent Rand is a contradiction He may be a savior figure but he is also a conqueror And a politician Rand wears a laurel leaved crown of prickly swords which should recall Christ but also Caesar What if Rand ends up a tiger burning bright rather than a little lambSo while Path of Daggers suffers from all of what we might call Robert Jordans obsessive writing disorders I find it a notable entry in The Wheel of TimeWe could argue that Frodo gets a little impatient with Sam now and then However if his gig with the One Ring doesnt work out Frodo could probably still fall back on a career in Santas workshop   This is one of the slowest books of the series Usually Mat saves the day even when nobody else does anything of value in a book but this time Mat is not here This is especially infuriating considering that his plot line ended in a huge cliffhanger in the previous book Perrins absence in book  is hardly noticeable Mats absence here is especially considering the slowmoving overall plotIt would be unfair to say that nothing at all happens here I counted four fairly major events in the book which to be fair is not that much for  pages especially considering that readers expected two of them to happen for a really long timeIn the beginning of the book Elaine was struggling to keep a leadership role with her motley crew Sea Folks Aes Sedai the Kin and lovesick Nynaeve The daughterqueen was constantly in the bad mood as a result but this part was fairly amusing and this particular subplot contained two out of the four major events I mentioned above  both expected at least one book agoEgwene in rebel Aes Sedai camp continues manipulating others while trying not to be manipulated What really bothers me about this whole situation is that everybody is so busy with these games that nobody cares to notice that one character really looks very suspicious and must be at least a Darkfriend she actually happens to be a Forsaken As it is she keeps killing people right under everybodys noses without anybody paying attention In contrast the White Tower Aes Sedai actually created a secret group of Black Ajah hunters which developed its methods of detecting them and has its first catch I found myself sympathizing with the White Tower in this issue  to my complete surprisePerrin starts the most annoying subplot of the series here Fortunately the worst part of it comes in the last chapter which means we do not get to experience it here it will drag on and on without moving anywhere in the next two booksRand slowly goes mad He is also the most misunderstood character so far He has to act alone for the most part which brings up arrogance in his dealings with people His plot line happens to be the most exciting one with a lot of actionThis book is not bad by any means at no point I was bored by it while reading The problem with it is that after you finish the realization comes that not much happens here I gave  stars to worse books this one only gets such a low rating only because it is not up to the standards of the previous ones This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes

{"title": "A Crown of Swords",
"isbn": "0812550285",
"author": "Robert Jordan",
"text": "A Crown of Swords the eagerly awaited sequel to Lord of Chaos The New York Times bestseller that swept the nation like a firestorm In this seventh book of Robert Jordans The Wheel of Time series Elayne Aviendha and Mat come ever closer to the bowl terangreal that may reverse the worlds endless heat wave and restore natural weather Egwene begins to gather all manner of women who can channelSea Folk Windfinders Wise Ones and some surprising others And above all Rand faces the dread Forsaken Sammael in the shadows of Shadar Logoth where the bloodhungry mist Mashadar waits for prey One fact though turned up again and again in those tales The Laurel Crown of Illian had been given a new name The Crown of SwordsWhoooooooshThats just the sound of the plot development being blown out the windowA Crown of Swords is the slowest Wheel of Time book so far by a clear mile If you think any of the previous books were slow youre in for a surprise But then again if youve started reading this series or even intend to read it at some point youve probably already been warned several times that yes this series does become incredibly slow at some point Theres no need for me to repeat that hereNothing happened in this book So why did I still like it so much The answer is simple Because Robert Jordan is the best worldbuilder in fantasy since Tolkien These last few books in the series have been able to give me a feeling Ive only had with two works of fantasy before Its impossible to describe but exclusively positive And that makes me blind to the books flaws most importantly the lack of plot development I dont care about that I just want to spend more time in this worldAnd finally the protagonists seem to have grown up a bit Mat is turning into a great character Egwene has already been awesome for a while Rand becomes more and more of an interesting protagonist Nynaeve has improved a lot and even Aviendha is considerably less annoying I dont think I hate anyone anymore Besides Elaida The Dark One take you ElaidaI think Im in love with this series                                              If someone ever wanted to make the case against men writing women they would probably find Robert Jordans The Wheel of Time a treasure troveIn fact perhaps one of the biggest problems in this series is the way that Jordan writes his strong female charactersTo be honest I think were supposed to find all this description of temptation and modesty initially cute and amusing  if nothing else its a balance for all that high level worldbuilding suspense Yes Rand and the Aes Sedai are powerful and seriously important people but they are just people Even our heroes have hormones Unfortunately all this sniffing of pheromones is excessive and ultimately distracting Jordans obsession with undermining the modesty of Randlands sexual mores including but not limited to folding arms beneath breasts smoldering gazes and yanking phallic symbols comes across as a bit trite for my tasteAnd the cat fighting is just ridiculousWhen it comes to cat fighting in The Wheel of Time there is a surprisingly long list of offenders but for me the teaming of Elayne and Nynaeve always means troubleElayne is our princess character and it seems that no matter where she goes or what she does she will be the center of a great deal of cat fighting Unfortunately A Crown of Swords is filled to the brim with Elayne chapters With Nynaeve the former princess of a small town by her side whats the worst that could happenChapter after chapter of cat fightingAnd if its not cat fighting its brow beatingA Crown of Swords should be a pretty cool entry Rand is preparing an invasion of Illian and a magic battle with a villainous Forsaken as always And this time its personal Egwene is trying to gain control of the rebel Aes Sedai Meanwhile Mat is running his army the Band of the Red Hand and is involved with the Cougar  I mean Queen  of Altara The Dark One who is more villainous than his name suggests has stifled Randlands weather in drought and in Ebou Dar Nynaeve and Elayne are searching for a magical device that can bring back the rain in the midst of a host of strong female cat fightersUnfortunately upon first reading I found the storyline hopelessly dull Rereading helped  perhaps because I knew this would be the last time wed see Mat for a while  but I still tend to rate A Crown of Swords one of the weaker novels in the series due to unacceptably high levels of poorly written strong female charactersGood examples of men writing women Norman Rushs Mating in which a woman considers her relationships with men is suitably bizarre William Gibsons female protagonists are also quite impressive particularly Cayce Pollard from Pattern Recognition   ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureMy reviews of The Wheel of Time novels are getting just as repetitive as the actual books Theres really not much more to say A Crown of Swords is another long slow installment in which there are too many detailed descriptions of clothing references to spanking concerns about bosoms and people blushing There are pages and pages which chronicle secondary characters extensive internal thoughts But what bugs me most though are the constant depictions of people and places as if they have a corporate personalityMen strutted arrogantly along the streets with often ragged vests and no shirts wearing great brass hoops in their ears and brass finger rings set with colored glass one knife or sometimes two stuck behind their belts Hands hovering near knives they stared as though daring someone to give the wrong twist to a look Others skulked from corner to corner doorway to doorway with hooded eyes imitating the slatribbed dogs that sometimes snarled from a dark alleyway barely wide enough for a man to squeeze into Those men hunched over their knives and there was no way to tell which would run and which stab By and large the women made any of the men appear humble parading in worn dresses and twice as much brass jewelry as the men They carried knives too of course and their bold dark eyes sent ten sorts of challenge in every glance  Children darted from every second door with chipped pottery cups of water sent by their mothers in case the Wise Women wished a drink Men with scarred faces and murder etched into their eyes stared openmouthed at seven Wise Women together then bobbed jerky bows and inquired politely if they could be of assistance was there anything that required carrying Women sometimes with as many scars and always eyes to make Tylin flinch curtsied awkwardly and breathlessly asked whether they might supply directions had anyone made a bother of themselves to bring so many Wise WomenIf I found myself in this place Id think it was The Twilight ZoneI will say however that someone must have told Mr Jordan to quit with the braid yanking because Nynaeve seems to be attempting to stop the habit Now if we could just get all of those ladies to stop adjusting their clothes every time they feel any sort of negative emotion and Ill be happy on the day that an Aes Sedai can walk down the street without making someone flinch cringe jump squeak drop something or run awayWith all this detailed description theres not much time for action There are only a few significant plot developments The most important one is an event which weve been waiting for for the last  books at least which finally occurs very quickly and anticlimatically in the last chapter of this book But if youve read this far into The Wheel of Time thats no surprise is it And if youve read this far you feel like its too late to stop now dont youIm listening to this on audiobook no patience for the print versions and I should mention that Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are amazing readers After all this time I suppose these characters are almost like family to them and theyve got the personalities down perfectly Their voices and additions of droll humor really instill some muchneeded life into these novels Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at    I read a lot of comments about Jordans epic which mention or outright complain about its pace and staging As far as Im concerned its deliberate pace and intricate staging are pluses Its not often that one finds such thoroughly realized visions of epic stories This series is a genuine throwback in storytelling style Instead of going the route of nonstop breathless action Jordan spends a good deal of time taking his readers through the sometimes withering grind of daytoday existence during a period of huge shifts in his world The Chinese have an old blessingcurse May you live in interesting times I think Wheel of Time offers a good example of just what a mix of good and bad that wish can be Early in the series theres so much discovery Everything is new and exciting By the time we reach this point things are becoming more grounded in the realization that the struggle is not going to be won quickly or easily That my friends is a sort of realism not generally seen in the fantasy genreThat said Jordan does indulge quite a bit in what Ive seen called his obsessive writing disorders He has his peculiarities and tics and they can get somewhat tiresome over time I took a break for a couple of months after reading this installment and it helped tremendously When I picked up the series again the idiosyncrasies were less grating The first time I encountered one my reaction was less therehegoesagain and more ohyeahhedoesthat I dont know if this one break will be enough to see me through the remainder of the series but Path of Daggers is moving along just fine   Is there a rating below  star I can giveI think this is about where I gave up on this bloody series And I only got this far because I was on a long road tripcamping trip and I picked them up cheap at a used book store in Anchorage IIRC But I have to admit that I cant tell them apart I honestly have no idea what happened where after about book  Which is in large part why I gave up on this atrocious pile of overwritten paidbytheword crapA friend of mine said at the time of Book  Not much happened in this one It was mostly character developmentExcuse meLet me get this straight Weve had SIX THOUSAND PAGES of these morons diddling around by now and theyre STILL not doing anything What is there to say about their character anymore You should know everything from the fillings in their teeth to what they ate for breakfast when they were to what they dream of when theyre jerking off Ok maybe Jordan does tell us the last one Im not sure  its all lost in the haze nowAt this point it was clear that Jordan was just padding his pockets and had no intention of ever actually going anywhere with this story Too many trees have died to support this shit already and too many brain cells have been abused by it Stop the madness   "},

flight The moon by day and the sun by night Blind woman deaf man jackdaw fool Let the Lord of Chaos ruleThere is no going back The Wheel of Time is now officially one of my favourite series of all time At times while reading I got this weird amazing feeling that only two other works of fantasy have given me before There was something this sixth book had that took me over the edge and far down the other side Or more specifically something this book did not haveThis series has in my eyes had two huge problems barring it from a place among the very best fantasy epics out there First that the plot development is so slow it sometimes feels like watching the grass grow Second that the protagonists are the most frustrating stupid stubborn arrogant idiots youll ever find in any series And thanks be to some miracle that second issue seems to have evaporated into thin air While reading this book I found myself loving Mat and Egwene feeling positively indifferent towards most of the others and actually starting to like even Rand himselfAnd when you have an absodamnlutely amazing series and take away its single biggest problem youre left with well an absodamnlutely amazing series Slow plot development or no without the horrible characters that sometimes made me want to throw these books in the closest wall I am truly able to appreciate the epic work of a man whom I would now describe as the best fantasy writer and worldbuilder since Tolkien himselfThis was not the best Wheel of Time book so far but it deserves all the stars simply for turning me into an adoring fan And sure tons of political intrigue Forsaken pointofview chapters a Whitecloak actually being bloody awesome and a return to the eerily wonderful Shadar Logoth it all did helpDamn I love this                                              ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureI could almost copy and paste my review for Fires of Heaven right here and it would be mostly suitable because Lord of Chaos is more of the same This is another metropolitancityphonebooksized novel with a potentially interesting story that is bogged down by its excruciatingly slow pace regular insertions of backstory constant descriptions of the garb of every major and minor character garb which keeps getting smoothed straightened or otherwise adjusted and too many mentions of expanses of bosoms spankings sitting on knees sniffing snorting and braid yanking I swear if I have to read good stout TwoRivers woolens one more timeIn Lord of Chaos some of the most interesting WOT characters are absent eg Egeanin and Lan some of the formerly interesting characters have become almost intolerable eg Siuan and Aviendha and some who should have grown up by now just wont Nynaeve and Faile At least we get to visit a new city  Ebou Dar  in which everyone looks and acts the same and all the women are looking for fights with knivesThe only really entertaining parts of Lord of Chaos were Lews Therins mumblings in Rands head  I thought this was clever and amusingWhere are all the dead Lews Therin whispered Why will they not be silentRand chuckled grimly Surely that had to be a jokeThere is a climax at the end of the book that truly changes the course of the story and I hope will serve to pick up the pace in the next novel but it took entirely too long to get there and involved a sudden change in some of the characters normal behavior Rands got a horde of Aiel maidens and wise ones around him everywhere he goes and then they suddenly decide to take a coffee break when a group of Aes Sedai come to visit Huh Well I was puzzled but at least there was finally some action even if the events around it seemed contrivedRobert Jordan is a smooth writer whos got an interesting story to tell thus three stars but he dilutes its power by drawing it out This books plot should have been combined with the previous two books plots and then  of the words should have been removed There was so much repetition that we probably wouldnt have missed anything Then instead of three slow and repetitive novels wed have one great novel Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at    This book contains much more different point of views than the first five we even get to see the inner thoughts of some of the Forsaken Each POV usually contributes to a different plot subplot or thread which makes a really complex overall story so if you thought the one in the first five books was way too simple I am kidding this book really makes matters much more complex This is also the point where the number of named characters became too great for all of them to be in the glossary at the endAs usual to avoid the spoilers I will give the analysis of the character development and my thoughts about them Any mention of the plot at this time would be a spoilerThe Dragon Reborn himself is an interesting study about his true identity Is he really reborn reincarnated or his own person completely independent from Lews Therin Do not expect an easy answer to this questionRand spends most of his time jumping between Caemlin and Caerhien while trying to hold the throne of the first until Elaine comes back but she is not a big hurry to do it I will comment on her laterPerrin finally shows up but I am sorry to say he is reduced from a person to a rug by Faile who firmly guides him He has his brief moment of glory by the end of the book but even then the scene is stolen by other charactersMat is interesting as usual His plot line makes an interesting and unexpected turn by the middle of the book The way he gets treated by Wonder Girls Nynaeve Elaine and Egwene is inexcusable Rand uses him as well but at least he realizes it and feels regret doing this most of the time he really does not have a choice The Wonder Girls abuse his without a second thoughtNynaeve at least has decency to avoid Mat most of the time She also begins to shine as a healer who can hold on her own even compared to the great healers from the Age of Legends She is directly responsible for one of the most emotional part of the bookAnybody with the last name Trankand should be shot with belfire  simple as that with Galad being one possible exception his is not in this book Morgaise betrayed her kingdom  yes what she did was a betrayal regardless of what her motivations were Elaine does not care about her kingdom much as well she prefers Aes Sedai intrigues to going back to her throne which Rand has real troubles holding for her Do not even let me start on Gawyn he moved to bad guys camp in my book and firmly rooted in thereThe book is interesting and good enough to warrant easy  stars The reason for  star rating Two words Dumais Wells This has got to be one of the most memorable battles in fantasy literature with even more exciting and interesting aftermath This also happens to be the last book of the series which deserves five stars before the infamous slowdown a mustread This review is a copypaste of my BoolLikes one

train ride from St Pancras to Gatwick and a flight from there to JFK  pages In a hour train ride and a hour flightIt was difficult to read while opening and eating the meals served on the plane and equally difficult to concentrate while the flight attendant was asking whether I was aware there was a video screen as well to which I politely replied Yes thank you while really thinking Go away Im reading but I prevailed in the end                                              If feels like a different series now The pace is moving at least three times as fast as the later Jordan books And thats being charitable Lets face it Theres a about one hundred pages of Crossroads of Twilight where the sum total of the action was that Elayne took a bath There are seemingly endless stretches where Jordan would devote a page or two to an Aes Sedai raising an eyebrow  or worse almost raising an eyebrowOn top of that the emotional range of the characters has expanded greatly It seemed for about  books that the characters experienced a range of emotions varying from seething anger to fury On top of that we might get a helping of scorn or condescension but the rest of the emotional palette was pretty much absent And now it has returned  and not just for RandAnd the biggest news is that the major characters have finally stopped their neverending state of denial Instead of simply denying what they have become Perrin Mat and Rand are now starting to embrace it Although I like this shift it doesnt seem as organic as it should and I think that largely results from the radical speeding up of the glacial pace of the earlier books Because these changes happen so fast they seem a bit forced to me And they also leave me wondering how cool the series might have been if Jordan had focused on bringing about these changes instead of either ignoring the issue or having the characters cling to their states of denial The last thing thats bothering me about this series as a whole is how generally safe everything appears to be We started out with  young villagers leaving their home in a hurry because it was attacked by monsters They get led by a witch her bodyguard and then a minstrel Later on they run into a gentle giant a prince and princess a half brother of theirs and the Queen All these people are hunted by unimaginably powerful evil wizards who have been locked up for centuries and are really pissed off after having had a really sucky millennium And after maybe  pages all of these characters are still thriving MINOR SPOILER AHEAD On top of that the book has now fully descended into the Red Shirt of Death syndrome Moraine says three people have to go into the tower to rescue her Mat Thom and one other who she does not know From miles and miles away you can see it was bad news for the third guy I was actually a bit surprised that Sanderson didnt dress him in a nice form fitting red shirt in a nod to Star TrekOne final criticism of the series as a whole A central idea of the series is that Rand Mat and Perrin are tavaren That means that the Pattern fate weaves itself strongly around these three At the outset I thought this was a pretty cool idea More and more it seems like it simply allows the writers to be lazy by having characters do things that are stupid and out of character Thus someone does something convenient for a plot resolution but its something that that person would never do in a million years and there is no drama leading up to the decision Then someone else says tavaren And thats supposed to explain it all     Prelude to the actual review and doesnt need to be read before the body of the review   originally reviewed Nov Updated Dec  Im about a third of the way through this book and Ive got to say that while there are some wonderful moments Sanderson is carrying on Jordans tradition of beating a subject or plot point not only to death but till it falls apart and starts to stinkI am heartily sick to death of Perrins self flagellation and flat refusal to accept ANY realityafter  pages dont you think we can please please stop going over and over and over the same ground Just give the character a cat o nine tails and let him actually beat his back bloody and get it over with When I got into the first section of this repeated crap I considered heaving the book across the room but as it weighs a ton and might knock out a wall I desisted I finally got through that scene and here I am only a bit later and Perrin is whining about not being a Lord not being a leader not wanting the Wolf Banner upweve been over this a thousand timesOkayrant over for a while but I really really hope this thing pulls itself together and STOPS GOING OVER WHATS BEEN COVERED AD NAUSEUM  REVIEW Well here we go This is the th book in the Wheel of Time thats book THIRTEENnot counting New Spring of course as its book  a prequel If youve read my reviews of the previous volumes you know that Ive become quite dissatisfied with this situation BUT more about that later If as Ive said you have read my previous reviews you will recognize that my rating here is actually a step up from the last few volumes While still unable to say I truly like the book it is a step forward And about time as unless the ax falls and more volumes are announced an eventuality that wouldnt actually surprise me this is the next to the last volumeFirstthe good Mr Sanderson is an excellent writer and it occasionally shows There are some wonderful moments in this book I found some passages very moving and what was exceptionally good was that at least a few are moving in more than one way First they are genuinely emotional scenes and second they move the story along The advancement of this story has been exceptionally slow up to now So there were some moments of actual enjoyment for me hereSecondthe neutral As mentioned Mr Sanderson is a good writer and he manages to capture the story the characters and the types that Mr Jordan has established These things will hit different people different ways some will find a lot of positive others a lot of negative The idiotic battle of the sexes is still here as are the attitudes of each of the characters and groups The fatalistic are still fatalistic the annoying are still annoying and so on You will easily recognize what you may have come to like and dislike in the series All the customs etc are still with usRand accepts his toh at one point and so onThirdthe bad The frustratingly bad things are still here to The long repetitive passages are still here The rereretelling of the same details from every possible point of view still takes place an event that happened and was discussed ad nausem  hundred pages ago is related to a new group the Aes Sedai the Aeil somebody and it gets discussed againmaybe another  pages who knows There are also long pointless conversations by that I refer to the ones that dont have any effect on the story nor tell us anything new I know it can be argued that they reinforce characters and character types but its been  pages dont you think the character types might have been established by nowThere are those who love these books just the way they are and for you Im happy I know a couple of people who agree with you They would be happy to read what the characters had for each meal what their clothes were made of and how they slept each night To you anything that stretches out the experience is great But it doesnt improve the novel the overall story It in my opinion has turned this series from about volume  A Crown of Swords on into a soapopera This volume is  pages  words in audio about  hours of listening I truly believe that in the hands of a good editor the entire series including the one to come could be cut down to from  to  volumes total and probably closer to I loved the first  books in this series and feel almost the same about the th I believe that it was on the way to becoming one of the greatest High Fantasy Epics in print but that fell by the wayside long ago What happened Why did the story suddenly become a lumbering crippled behemoth of a soapopera stumbling forward at a glacial pace Did someone suddenly realize that each book was a best seller and the more volumes that were in the series the more money would be made Did the editors suddenly stop editing because the books were so popular that they were no longer allowed to edit the writer Did the story simply start to wander as all possible details began to work their way in about each character and groups thoughts and actionsI suppose well never know Some of you will totally disagree with me and feel this is wonderful and love every second every word of it Others like me will be frustrated and disappointed about what could have been Im not kidding when I say Im happy for you who love the way this series is going To the rest of uswell it is what it is The blurb on this book says the Last Battle has started well not so youll notice I do plan to get the last volume from the library when its published I want to see how it comes out But I think Ill always mourn what this series might have been Might have been could have been the old refrain   Final rating  starsThis book has two very different parts which divide it exactly in the middleThe first part nothing at all happens Yes you read it right the first  of the book make Crossroads of Twilight  which is considered the slowest Jordans book  look like a nonstop action thriller I just finished reading this one and cannot recall any event of some significance whatsoeverThe first chapter returns to POV of a lowly and completely irrelevant farmer who provided a ride to Rand and Mat in the first book of the series and promptly went to oblivion since then Luckily  he is back with all his irrelevance but we have to suffer several pages catching up on his backstory and current troubles with apple harvest He meets Rand for a couple of minutes and a couple of words before going away  hopefully for good this timeMost part of the book is taken by Mat and Perrin subplots and opposed to Rand and Egwene in the previous book There were huge buildups for the former couple of characters which falsely led me to believe there will be explosive action throughout the whole book Well Mat spends his time thinking about the amount of lace to put on his coat when he briefly thinks about making it pink  this is where it became clear that the joke overstayed its welcomeAs to Perrin he still broods about not wanting a leadership role He also has some problems with his wife but unfortunately there is no marriage counseling in their world so he and the readers have to suffer I forgot the last time Perrin did anything exciting and not saying his wifes name on every single line during his inner monologueTo make a long story short this was the first time ever I thought about abandoning the series  one book before the end of it no less Brandon Sanderson finally found his Jordans vibe  unfortunately it came from the wrong part of the seriesI remember Robert Jordan said he planned only one more book in the series shortly before his death Seeing it took Brandon Sanderson three large ones to do it I was sure Jordan would not be able to keep his promise Now that I finished the second Sandersons entry of the series I am sure the promise was quite realistic the first half of this novel does not have any excuse for its existence and could be removed from the final edition without any loss whatsoeverThe second part starts with some very exciting and ultimately satisfying action from Mat Unfortunately as soon as it stops so does the plot movement We have a lot of forgettable talks meaningless movement of people etc After a while the action and excitement come back only to come to a screeching halt later This whole part is one big rollercoaster of action and walking in circles Come to think of it the whole Mats quest was underwhelming considering it took him two books to prepare for it I also need to mention this book  number  of the series  was the first time I felt depressed while reading Aviendha visionsThe final rating  stars for the first half slightly below  stars for the second half which gives  stars overall This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one httpgenebooklikescompost   "},

                                              I first picked up the Wheel of Time series fifteen years ago while a freshman in college I remember being totally caught up in the series consumed by the characters and taken in by the world I looked forward to every page couldnt decide on my favorite character and couldnt wait for the next book That changed as the series went on Wandering plotlines characters that became so unlikeable that I loathed when they appeared for more than a chapter at a time and so much of the plot taken up with unimportant throwaway characters that I felt like I needed a separate book just to keep up with all of the characters I remember clearly the moment I decided I was done with the series after an entire book searching for the bowl of winds only to reach the end of the book and with bowl in hand the characters do nothing It was another half a book before the artifact was finally used So it wasnt until Robert Jordan died that I went back and picked up the last few books that I hadnt read in anticipation of Brandon Sandersons writing the final novel I was pleased to find that the books resolved some of the issues as they went on even though as I picked up the last of the Wheel of Time books I learned it would be the last of threeThe Gathering Storm renewed my love of the Wheel of Time Sandersons writing pays homage to Jordan just enough that the book doesnt seem disjointed but it so many ways it is much better Rare are the chapters where we follow a character through the minutia of walking from one place to another without the plot moving forward Chapters told from the point of view of characters not central to the plot were revealing and concise The plot moves forward at a satisfying pace and resolves many of the plotlines that we have been waiting years for Even more satisfying is that the characters become likeable again Even Rand by the end is one step closer to being a sympathetic character I totally recommend the Gathering Storm as a book that will renew the faith of Jordan readers like me who became disenchanted over the years Im looking forward to the final two books of the A Memory of Light and in the meantime I will be introducing myself to Sandersons other books   So this is book  of the Wheel of Time series and this is the first one which is written after Jordans death by Brandon Sanderson I am not going to lie Sanderson is the reason I began reading the WoT series because I wanted to read everything by him but along the way Jordan sucked me in developed this stunning world of visionary resentful powerful and dangerous characters and created a massively fun story Some of the books are better than others I liked most of the ones so far although book  remains my favourite at the moment and yet getting to the Sanderson books still makes me feel so good Not because I forced my way through the series or hated it I didnt but because I knew that I began  or so years ago with the series because I wanted to get to the Sanderson books and now I have done so and so far its wonderfulBook  is the beginning of the end Whilst Knife of Dreams book  was the start of Jordans attempt to bring the strings back together book  is the beginning of the questions being answered and the characters forming up and resolving their problemsplotlines in order to be ready for the inevitable Last Battle In terms of how Sanderson compares to Jordan as a writer I think he does a great job of not disrespecting the story which Jordan set up so well He says in the introduction to the book that he never wanted to lie and try to emulate Jordan and have none of his personality come through but equally he wanted it to be true to Jordans wishes for the story and he wanted it to come out right in the end Sanderson being a longterm fan of the series is also obviously a big help to him because he knew these characters and he knew who they were before he began writing them and he does a fab job of emulating them and continuing their storylines in a way that makes them believable still In terms of the plot this book is undeniably much better paced than some of the previous ones by Jordan himself Whilst Jordans books tend to be a steady and slow build with the halfway point being the turning point where the action really begins Sanderson has a knack for instantly starting out with something that will not only interest you but will also capture and hold your attention for the duration of the book I flew through this book a lot quicker than any of the last few books in the series I wanted at all times when I was busy to have the audiobook going or the physical book in hand It was fun it was fab it was full of answers and resolutions which weve been longing for and ultimately needing The series has in my opinion benefited massively from Sanderson taking over and thats no discredit whatsoever to Jordan as he set everything up and planned everything out meticulously but Sanderson is better at engaging you quicker On the whole I wont go into any details about what really happens in this book but just know that this is the second best of the series so far with the first one being book  by Jordan himself and that it really is a throughly good read I would say that this has filled me with so much excitement for the final two books now and I eagerly await seeing where they will take not only me as the reader but the characters that we follow in the story I want to know who will win how will they win and what is going to happen in the end to the world of the Wheel of Time Theres so much originality which for a time became a little stale but now I have nothing but anticipation for book  and A wonderful  read with so many improvements to the characters storylines and the way theyre progressing Cant wait for book  very soon    This twelfth volume of The Wheel of Time is one of the most famous of recent times Simply because it was at the time it was promised expected to be the final volume of the then ongoing series It was also the first volume written by Brandon Sanderson then known simply for Mistborn The Final Empire with the aid of many many notes left by Robert Jordan When I picked up The Eye of the World three or so years ago I knew that this twelfth volume of The Wheel of Time due at the end of that year was by a different author I had no inkling of how I should feel about that as on the whole I dislike novels by other authors Yet a friend had recommended the series strongly to me so I decided to read it and I personally very much enjoyed the story all the way up to this twelfth volume Then when I read The Gathering Storm I was impressed by how skilfully put together the story was and consider it to be one of the finest in the entire seriesBrandon Sanderson as an author has several strengths which combat Jordans weaknesses nicely in this novel One friend recently posed that there are two types of writers There are those who are natural storytellers more concerned with the plot ideas and details Then there are the technicians those who focus more on prose and literary qualities over stories Now they stated most authors are combinations of both by nature yet they seem to have one aspect more strongly over the other I would say that while Sanderson is a writer with ideas and natural storytelling ability that he is a stronger technical writer than JordanWhen I say that Sanderson is a stronger technical writer Id like to consider it from this perspective Do you believe if their roles were reversed that Jordan would be able to as effectively write Sandersons stories I personally theorise that Jordan would find it more difficult to adapt to Sandersons style Brandon Sanderson in this novel has done something that is ridiculously near impossible in copying Jordans style and telling the story as Jordan wanted more or less Yes there are flaws every so often when as a reader you realise that an expression or idea dropped by Sanderson does not quite fit into the logical confines of Robert Jordans world yet for the most part he does a perfect job of capturing Jordans writing style and the voices of the characters he fills this world with If you disagree try writing a short story in the style of your favourite author and you will see how hard it can be to emulate writingIn calling Sanderson a stronger technical writer I would also like to point out that Sanderson typically uses a less wordy style than Jordan That is not to say that Sanderson is not lengthy when he writes indeed some of his sentences occasionally prove a touch awkward and he himself readily admits that he is not the greatest author of all time However that said Sanderson has an economy of language that works it seems to me that he understands his limits and the theories of writing to a strong degree On the other hand I feel that Jordan at times writes in a style that is overly long and above what he should aim for I personal feel that Sandersons sense of economy adds pace and energy to this novel in addition to the strength of Jordans worldbuilding I also felt that Sanderson added degrees of humour and warmth which I havent felt from the other books in the series Now I do not intend this to be a sign of disrespect for Robert Jordan Indeed I think it would have been great if he had been able to finish the story himself Yet Sanderson has clearly added something to this book that for good or for bad makes it a better and stronger story    Final rating  starsAfter an early and unexpected death of Robert Jordan somebody had to finish his magnum opus A relatively new and unknown at the time author was chosen Brandon Sanderson Fortunately for the series fans Jordan left enough notes regarding further plot developments and it is said the final chapters of the last book were entirely written by him So did Sanderson succeed in continuing the biggest epic series in fantasy It really depends on what you expect from Wheel of TimeThe first and foremost complaint about Sandersons writing was about the characters they did not feel right and became somewhat twodimensional the latter is my own opinion I will give a detailed picture of each of the major people belowRand has his emo moments practically nonstop I was reminded of Sazed in the last two books of Mistborn trilogy he was in exactly the same mood most of the time Rands last development in the book came up completely out of blue and without any good reason or explanation He has his moments thoughIf you heard anything at all about the series and Sandersons writing you know that he completely missed writing the most interesting character in books  Mat Basically Jordans Mat used to be a lovable rogue but Sandersons Mat is a foulmouthed rude The less is said about him the betterI am happy to say that Perrin felt exactly the same as before The guy had his last exciting moment in book  before Faile firmly wrapped him around her finger he cannot have two thoughts without one of them being about his wife anymore Sandersons Perrin is as boring as Jordans but this is really not his faultNynaeve became interesting when she decided to become useful She does not have a lot of screen time but she still keeps pulling her braid as usual I really cannot say anything bad about herEgwene spends first half of the book pretending to be a character from a BDSM themed book the one with heavy spanking she practically enjoys it She started being fairly close to Jordans vision I feel as her plotline developed she became more and more distant from that vision She also became quite hypocritical by the end but I suspect it comes with having a lot of power The majority of the book was spent with two Aes Sedai fractions rebel and the White Tower which means we get to see a lot of Egwene I was never a big fan of petty intrigues by obnoxious magic users who do not know the meaning of humility there are only two exceptions for this so this is one of the influencing factors the book did not get a higher rating from meA couple of more notes on the characters Elaida used to be a fairly complex character but she became a psychotic while Tuon is a lovesick puppy all of a sudden I also need to mention one of the biggest reasons I like the series was the sense of wonder when I read it whether some ruins of the ancient forgotten cities giant statues built in times forgotten uncovered relics serving unknown purposes some magic constructs  something was always there to stimulate my imagination Even in the slowest book of the series  Crossroads of Twilight  one of the towns visited by Perrin impressed the hell out of me with its creepiness Well this sense of wonder is completely gone from the first Sandersons book I can literally feel him rushing to reach the end of the series and completely ignoring such trivialities along the wayI need to be very generic in this part of the review to avoid very big spoilers as I am about to talk about some of the plot resolutions Some of them felt forced and way too simplistic after the monumental buildup I am talking about the whole Verin help and the confrontation with one of the Forsaken I could go on and on but I cannot be more specificThe first part of the book was slow  slower than the last Jordans book In the second part the pace picked up considerably and different subplot resolutions kept piling on the top of each otherDo you expect a typical summer blockbuster movie a lot of huge explosions fastmoving plot and flat characters You got it here Do you want continue enjoying the world full of wonders at a leisurely pace or interesting cases of character developments Look somewhere else Even with all the problems I mention the book is good enough to warrant  stars the widespread opinion is that the last two books are improvement of this one so I am eagerly await to continue with the series This review is a copypaste of my BookLikes one

Please be mindful of this in the comments both for me and for others who may or may not have progressed past this point in the series Thank youId forgotten how much happens in this book    Holy WOWThis is the first but not the last book that begins with a several seemingly nonrelated POVs and as impatient as I always am to get to the good stuff I always appreciate these early updatesreminders of whats going on with maybe less important subplots that maybe arent a main focus of the installment at handBc really    even though youre just starting  SO MUCH has already transpired    Sometimes its hard to keep trackSO Min whispers in disguise returns to the White Tower and everywhere she looks she sees future violence and death But when or why No clueWhich Siuan of course uses as an excuse to keep her in the Tower Not that she needs an excuse bc Amyrlin She also decides that it would be best for Min to remain disguised bc sneaky Aes Sedai so poor Min who prefers

for world domination whispers Suppress the new information and ignore it of courseAnd last but not least a fatal character flaw is revealed in a certain usurping Aes Sedai I wont be able to say for certain until much further into my reread but Im pretty sure I could directly connect every single crack in her foundation to this singular flaw    unsuccessfully attempts to suppresses rage OHMYGAWD I HATE herAfter all of that is out of the way one of the coolest  and creepiest things that happens in the whole series goes downAs the seals holding the Dark Ones prison weaken she said after a time

  The Shadow shall rise across the world and darken every land even to the smallest corner and there shall be neither Light nor safety And he who shall be born of the Dawn born of the Maiden according to Prophecy he shall stretch forth his hands to catch the Shadow and the world shall scream in the pain of salvation All Glory be to the Creator and to the Light and to he who shall be born again May the Light save us from himThe People of the Dragon hold the Stone of Tear and mighty Callandor lies in the hands of the Dragon Reborn The prophecies are being fulfilled one by one But in the tombs of Shayol Ghul the seals are being broken The Black Ajah grows stronger by each passing day And the Forsaken return to the world of men heralding the coming of the Dark One And a group of ordinary men and women from the village of Emonds Field are left to combat the Shadow RisingThe Shadow Rising is in many ways the best book in The Wheel of Time series so far But unfortunately there are a few negative parts too For the first three hundred pages or so our heroes do not take a single step away from Tear though some of them try The storyline is put completely on hold as Rand and his companions take a break in the Stone which is rather unfortunate in a fantasy series thats already this long Still the politics of Tear and the mysteries of its great fortress are interesting enough to keep the reader entranced even through the dreary chaptersMy main issues with this book lie with certain characters The first of those is Faile Perrins exotic love interest As a knifewielding rogue who ran away from her family to become a Hunter of the Horn of Valere Faile could have been no should have been a very interesting character However that is not the case as she spends the entirety of the book acting like a spoiled child whose stubbornness makes Rand seem rather normal in comparison The second character is Aviendha a Maiden of the Spear whose only purpose in this book is to yell at Rand and whine about him supposedly having mistreated Elayne And the third is Dain Bornhald a Whitecloak captain who has decided to blame Perrin for his fathers death and devotes his life to see him hang as a Darkfriend Perrins innocence is completely irrelevant to Bornhalds hatredOn the positive side the book is almost flawless otherwise It has some of the best scenes in the series so far in Rhuidean the holy place of the Aiel and in the White Tower Characters like Rand Nynaeve Perrin and Egwene who frustrated me immensely in book two and three seem to have grown up a little We also get to see more of the Forsaken reveal themselves learn more about the history of the Aiel and visit new places It is difficult to say any more about the book without revealing details about the plot so Ill leave you to figure the rest out for yourselves But in the end I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and that it was probably my favourite Wheel of Time book so far                                               starsORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureIn The Shadow Rising things start to slow down In fact it often feel like the reading of the story must take longer than it took for the events to actually occurPart of the problem is that Mr Jordan tells us nearly everything except when the characters make a bowel movement Also he regularly launches into preset spiels in which he redescribes something or someone who weve encountered numerous times before or reexplains something weve been told dozens of times eg Loial sounds like a bumblebee Perrin likes to think things through wet bowstrings are bad trollocs eat anything as long as its meat Aes Sedai never lie but  Every time a Tinker shows up you may as well skip the next two paragraphs because they invariably describe first the eyejarring wagons and then the even gaudier clothes The format is nearly the same each time This is especially noticeable when reading the novels one after the other of courseA similar problem is that although Mr Jordans world is large diverse and interesting there is not much realistic diversity within a culture or group Every Aes Sedai of the red ajah hates men all the greens love men the whites are arrogant without exception the browns love books and dont notice the ink on their noses All Domani women are seductive and people from Tear use fishing metaphors It gets to the point of ridiculousness when even though theyve nearly been destroyed by enemies Tinkers are still cringing at the swords of the people protecting them And the Aiel who use spears and knives and are the fiercest fighters on the planet look disapprovingly at another cultures choice of weapon the sword and transportation the horse Oh come on  get over itAnother device thats getting annoying is the technique of giving the reader and other characters information by having a character say something out loud that they didnt realize theyd said Or stop in the middle of a sentence that they realize they shouldnt be saying Or stupidly have an important and potentially damning conversation in front of someone who they just metIn addition some of the writing is overdone We occasionally hear of measureless steps heartbeats that take centuries moments that last forever infinite slowness bottomless drops razor edges of something or otherOkay thats a lot of complaining but thats what happens when you read these books contiguously You start to notice this stuff and it grates on the nerves But even so the slowly advancing plot is still unpredictable and compelling and the characters are mostly enjoyable The best parts of The Shadow Rising actually focus on the secondary characters of Siuan Sanche and Egeanin I truly enjoyed their stories and look forward to hearing what happens to themSo even with all my gripes The Shadow Rising is still keeping me entertained Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at    Im buddy reading this entire series a book a month with the great fantasy loving peeps at Buddies Books and Baubles The great thing about that is that I know I have so many great people to discuss all the happenings in this book with The bad part is that after taking a month to read a single book a few chapters at a time it feels like some of it happened so long ago and perhaps an entire season on one of your favorite shows has gone by and how do you sum that up without a review that is ten pages long The answer is you dont so Im just going to hit some highlightsIn my opinion this is Perrins break out book Much of the focus was on him and his struggle with the life of a blacksmith he thought he would have and the new life of a leader he is going to have He goes back to help the people of the Two Rivers and you can really see how much he has changed from the country bumpkin he used to be Overall Perrins was my favorite arc in the book Not just because he goes back to Two Rivers but also because I really enjoyed his love interest Faile I know a lot of people arent a fan of their relationshipbut Im not one of them I totally love the banter and how each has a warriors heart and they fight with each other but always for each otherSo while Perrin is off in the Two Rivers Rand and Mat have their own journey While a lot of this is still really interesting due to the time spent with the Aeil I struggle so much with Mat Im waiting for him to break out of his selfish thoughts and become truly great but currently he is busy going through mysterious doors and talking with alien people When he isnt doing that he seems to be busy chasing women and playing dice Im hoping the next book he will grow a little more Rand however is very distrustful of almost everyone around him and keeps everything to himself There is some headway on the Three women who will love him and I have a really good idea of where that is going but more than that we see how strong he is when he channels Too bad he has very sporadic and sparse control of itLan and Nynaeve finally got to have another semisweet conversation and I really did miss that in the last book I wish we get a little more time with them together but Nynaeve is busy at the moment hunting Black Ajah and so little time for romance there Nynaeve and Elyanes was the other arc that was interesting because they are on a very dangerous journey to find the women who left the White Tower and have given themselves to the Dark One Two against Thirteen doesnt seem fair odds but with a little company they might do okayThis was my favorite book of the series so far There is a lot more action and story progression Plenty of danger and bad guys to go around between the Trolocks Black Ajah Forsaken and White Cloaks It also seems that there are more dangers afoot than just those and I can see why the prophecies say The Dragon Reborn will break the worldVery much looking forward to book    Before I start my review there is something I really need to get off my chest GAWYN TRAKAND IS A COMPLETE IDIOT WHO HAS A DUBIOUS DISTINCTION OF BEING THE MOST IDIOTIC GOOD GUY IN THE HISTORY OF FANTASY OR LITERATURE IN GENERAL Sorry I had to do it now back to the reviewIt is hard to say anything about the fourth book in a series without giving huge spoilers I will just give my thoughts about the major characters their development and plotlines Mat slowly becomes the most interesting character in the series and will stay that way until the last book written by Jordan The events in this book shaped his further development and personalityPerrin has the most tragic and heroic plotline in the book His love to Faile is full of touching moments I am also very sorry to say that this is the last book where he is not boring and Faile is not extremely annoying Nynaeve while being Nynaeve still has her moment of glory in the book which made me feel a lot of respect for her she alone went view spoilerheadtohead with one of the Forsaken  Moghedein  and lived to tell the tale  a very impressive feat Rands development is interesting but somewhat overshadowed by the other characters I really need to mention that the history of Aiel which he sees in flashbacks going back in time is one of the most powerful moments of the series if not the most powerful Speaking of Aiel their culture is unique and fascinating this book gives a lot of insight into it It is very interesting to see fearsome presentday desert warriors knowing their humble beginning One more note I already mentioned that the White Tower while supposedly the safest place in the land what can go wrong in the middle of a large number of magic users who can do no evil is actually more dangerous than the Blight  the stronghold of the Big Bad Guy This novel clearly shows it The book is one of the best examples of classic fantasy and deservedly so The only reason I would lower the rating was the character of Gawyn whom I already mentioned but he alone cannot spoil an otherwise excellent installment of the seriesbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   "},

the bullet and reading book  That means I HAVE NOT read book  yet Please be mindful of this in the comments both for me and for others who may or may not have progressed past this point in the series Thank youThe Dragon Reborn is where things really start getting good PLEASE NOTE that I am speaking strictly from the REREAD perspective If you have never read the series before the first two books are spectacular Spectacular x even Its only knowing whats coming and being impatient to get to the even better parts that makes books  and  merely enjoyable when compared to the depth of imagination and interconnectedness as the series progressesBUT All of that epicness must have a solid foundation on which to buildAnd book  is still very much a part of that early foundationlaying process However TWO very important things happen in this installment and those two things make all the difference Mat is healed from the taint of the Shadar Logoth dagger Perrin meets FaileI dont know if priortobook Mat was part of Jordans character growth process or if he just got bored with the characterI certainly found the early version to be tiresomebut when Mat wakes from being Healed in Tar Valon hes almost a completely different person Oh hes still a rascal but no longer a rascal of the juvenile variety Instead he becomes that kind of clever scalawag roguetype character who has always been one of my personal favorites In another life HA he would have made an excellent pirateIts the difference between telling a couple of younger boys a story about ghost hounds then covering a few dogs in flour and loosing them on the village green and betting Galad and Gawyn that he can beat them his quarterstaff against their two swords both bc he needs the money to finance his escape and also bc it would be funThen theres Faile A lot of WoT fans arent particularly fond of Faile and maybe Ill change my mind after rereading some of the later installments    but I doubt itI just like herFirstly shes Saldaean which is my second favorite people group after the Aiel Almost all of the drama in her relationship with Perrin can be attributed to her nationality and where others are simply exhausted by her and her antics I chalk it up to cultural differences legit cause for misunderstandingsAnd when shes not behaving in what a nonSaldaean would consider a ridiculous manner her interactions with Perrin are positively delightful I am full of delightHer appearance is also the first concrete manifestation with longterm consequences of one of Mins Viewings So yeah those two things are where I turn the corner and stop fighting the urge to skim things Ive read numerous times beforeThis book is also where the Forsaken start to become real characters instead of flat boogiementype shapes In The Eye of the World we learned nothing beyond the fact that some of them were no longer imprisoned and that there were two fewer of them in world In The Great Hunt the information was limited to Lanfear But in The Dragon Reborn we not only learn more about Lanfear we also meet at least three others and some of the mystery surrounding Baalzamon is    not revealed per se but I definitely felt I understood what the situation was by the time I finished the book And anytime we learn anything about the Age of Legends whence the Forsaken came I am a happy camperBasically I loved it PS is it just

  This was a hugely important book for me This is a fourteen book series and after the last book I was practically ready to stop reading it I had to have a six month reading break because I was that frustrated with it I thought that Rand was characterised horrendously and I felt that he regressed to an early state All in all Robert Jordan had gone backward in his character development of his hero So this book had to win me over to keep me readingAnd it did It so bloodywell did My faith in the author has been completely restored Yay Rand is still the same heroic coward but this time his actions actually corresponded with the events When he ran he had reason to do so He also had very few point of view chapters He is still the centre of the story but its telling is given over to much more interesting characters like Mat Nynaeve and my personal favourite Perrin So lets starts with the best character  He has the heart of a wolf The book opens with Perrin Its still very early days but he is one of the only characters I actually have sympathy for His confidence has developed even further When he taps the ancient magic that allows him to communicate with wolves they run to his aid and welcome him as leader of their pack This is a worthy boon for the young warrior but it doesnt come without its problems The ability alters his mind it makes him feral as the wolfish thoughts dominate his human senses He knows the danger of the ability thus he suppresses it and controls it I find his part of the story completely fascinating because he boarders on edges of remaining noble and good or loosing himself to animalistic savagery Moraine was silent for a time warming her hands Finally she spoke whilst staring into the flames The Creator is good Perrin The Farther of Lies is evil The Pattern of Age the Age Lace itself is neither The pattern is what is The Wheel of Time weaves all lives into the Pattern all actions A Pattern that is all one colour is no pattern For the Pattern of an age good and ill are the warp and the woofMoreover in this bleak and dark world that Jordan has created Perrin is one of the few with a pure heart which makes his inner darkness even more complex Like Rand and Mat he wants to hang up his weapons and go home he wants to forget about the long and hard task the wheel has set for him but he knows what he must do He knows that he cannot run he knows that he cannot escape fate So he grits his teeth and gets on with his duty After all he will have an important part to play in defeating the darkness He is too honourable to shirk from what he must perform I can see him eventually becoming the rock that holds the trio together He is a wellrounded character that is reliable and strong I just know that he will have the courage to insure that his friends succeed even if he has to drag them to their destiny  Finally some decent female characters Admittedly for the first time in this series I actually enjoyed the female side of the story Previously it seemed like Jorden could only write females in one way they were all confrontational moody hot headed physically attractive and at times even quite spiteful It was beginning to get a little bit ridiculous it was like he somehow naively perceived that all women have this same archetypal personality This was regardless of their social standing or life experience All the female characters were basically the same misogynistic reused stereotype Thankfully and at long last Jordens women are actually developing their own sense of individualism It took him long enough to get there Theyre finally out of the tower Well anyway the girls are coming into there own Nynaeve has had heaps of character development Shes learning to wield her magic to deadly affect but she still hasnt quite figured how to activate it properly She can only use it when in a state of pure agitation and anger It responds to rage and rage only When it is eventually unleashed it is powerful to behold but not controlled Shes a strong character and a very strong woman Shes quickly become the leader of the nave Egwene and the inexperienced Elayne She has the experience and the wisdom see what I did there to lead them in their hunt for the twisted Black Ajah It was great to see these characters have their own fully developed side story that eventually linked back to the main plot And the same is true for the cunning Mat  Every perfect fantasy story needs it rouge  Mat has also come along way Hes recovered from his illness though there is still some degree of taint in his heart He has memories that are not his own It will be interesting to see how this develops in later books as the true origin of his luck will hopefully be revealed The two are clearly connected and intertwined He is a strong character one who is developing faster than he can handle Hes already killed countless men which is something he would never have thought himself capable He has the danger of becoming numb to it as many fall to his agile wielding of his quarter staff This was a really good book and Im so glad Im actually looking forward to reading the next one The side characters really make this series worthwhile If you ignore Rand like Im trying to do you will see how complex and versatile these other characters are Their stories are much more interesting on every level The world is also rich in opposing culture and beliefs I like the way the forces of good are divided and mistrusting of each other The Children of the Light are potentially morally right but they are misguided and confused as to what is actually evil Their ethos is right though they just execute it in a roundabout way It will be interesting to see if they become pawns of the dark one or see the error of their ways I love these conflicting ideas So for me this series remains in the realms of perfect fantasy At least at the moment Hopefully it will remain good to its end The Wheel of time   Eye of the World An unoriginal five stars The Great Hunt  A reluctant three stars The Dragon Reborn A welldeveloped  stars      The alarm gongs sent echoes crashing through the Stone but Rand paid no more attention to them than he had to the roar that had come before like muffled thunder from somewhere below His side ached the old wound burned strained almost to tearing by the climb up the side of the fortress He gave the pain no heed either A crooked smile was fixed on his face a smile of anticipation and dread he could not have wiped away if he had wanted to It was close now What he had dreamed of CallandorRand alThor has finally and very reluctantly embraced his destiny as the Dragon Reborn after the events at Almoth Plain But his face is known throughout the nations now and he is hunted relentlessly by the numerous followers of the Shadow Thus begins a new journey and at its end lies the Stone of Tear the impregnable fortress of the Tairen in the far southThe Dragon Reborn while not reaching the same level as The Eye of the World is certainly an improvement from The Great Hunt The story is more compelling new villains arise and the childishness the completely unfounded arrogance and the insufferable stupidity of the main characters is finally starting to wear off But it is not gone Rand himself is barely appearing in this book and both Mat and Nynaeve seem to be improving considerably Perrin and Egwene however stand ready to assume the inglorious mantle of the worst charactersMostly though this book is a solid addition to the story of the Wheel of Time and the ending is great leaving the reader excited for the next volume The Shadow RisingThats all there is to say really Those of you who have already read this knows what it is about And those who havent yet should do so                                              Marches buddy read with Buddies Books and BaublesThe Dragon Reborn is my favorite book in this series so far A few reasons for that are Im pretty comfortable in this world now and can focus on the story more than all the parts places and lore The other reason is the character are becoming more developed and while at time I want to box their ears for fighting against their destinypowerspecialness so much instead of embracing it and just going with itShorter review for me than normal since there are a bazillion reviews on this series But the run down isRand  Still trying to save those around him and a little lost as to what to do with himself Also he is struggling a bit with the madness Is he mad or is the dark one just taunting him and making him think he is starting to go madidk the jury is still out on that He is on a quest to retrieve a sword that is not a sword and so even though most of his journey is shone third person a quest for a magical sword is rarely dullPerrin  Stubborn two rivers folk He is a wolf brother but fighting against it see totally want to box his ears because it is so cool and I want him to explore it But we find out why it might be dangerous as well Perrin meet a girl and damn if she doesnt have him on his toes not knowing what to think Let the games begin P  Mat  Well Mat has been my least favorite in prior books but he has grown a bit on me in this one Now that he isnt slightly crazy and paranoid he is a more likeable fellow even if he is totally oblivious to the danger surrounding him and figuring out why it is there The Wool Headed Ox has no idea that all the trouble he has been getting into might have something to do with the Dark One or some of the forsaken Ignorance is bliss I guess Still he has some really interesting things going on with his new found luck and is he perhaps channeling a little bit of a king from the pasthmmm time will tell He is definitely a lot more interesting nowMat also gets the best fight scene in this book and I totally loved how he was able to take down Elaynes brothers with a quarterstaff Mat is a man not to be underestimated anymore  Nynaeve Egwene and Elayne  These three did practically everything together in this so it is hard to separate them Even though I got a little tired of Egwene always fighting stubbornly with Nynaeve over EVERYTHING the rest of their story arc is really interesting Egwenes accepted test was almost as harsh as Nynaeves Also I enjoyed it as they learn more about what they can do with the one power and go on a quest to find the Black Ajah What is revealed about the Black Ajah in this book is scary to say the leastBest New Culture  The Aielyes yes I know that we got a glimpse of them in the last book But in this one we get a better understanding of them as their culture is fleshed out It also seems they have some prophecies of their own about the Dragon Reborn and those were some of the most interesting by far Plus they are badass fighters  And he totally kicked ass But the thing I love about the Aiel is not just that the men are great fighters but also the women They are all like ninjas sneaking around and rarely being seen They are masters of fighting camouflage and stealth Plus it seems like they might be Rands people and learning more about his true origins was one of the best highlights of this book for meEverything Else  There really is a lot going on withsome forsaken on the losethe Black Ajah plottingRands dreams permeating those around him and the weird side effects it is causingLoial stepping into the role of a fighter as well as an Ogier of just knowledgeMin and some of her predictionsMoraine trying to control the situation and kinda failing at itAnother prophecy coming to completionAnd FINALLY maybe FINALLY Rand will accept that he IS the Dragon Reborn and not try to deny his fate or destiny any longerThere is definitely a lot to enjoy in this installment even if again it takes a little time to get really rolling But overall this world and the overall plot arc is growing on me    Like the first couple of WoT books The Dragon Reborn started a little slow and then developed into quite an engaging and exciting read I like Jordans storytelling style He manages to keep me interested in the characters and the happenings even when not a lot is actually happening Despite being titled The Dragon Reborn this book was notable for the distinct absence of Rand as a POV character That meant that Perrin Egwene and Mat had to pick up the slack It was the making of both Mat and Perrin as both have now developed nicely as characters Mat was a little annoying in the early stages before stealing the show in the second half of the book Perrin is now just dependably likeable and interesting Things went less well for Egwene Her story was interesting but she herself has gotten a bit less likeable The world building was as awesome as ever and we got to visit more places like Illian and Tear in this instalment We also got to learn a bit more about the White Cloaks and the Forsaken Jordan wove a bunch of interesting story arc over the course of the story and then had a lot of those separate threads converge in an explosive and exciting ending All in all this was a great addition to the WoT seriesRating  starsAudio Note Krammer and Reading were fantastic as always    "},

"text": "The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass What was what will be and what is may yet fall under the Shadow For centuries gleemen have told of The Great Hunt of the Horn Now the Horn itself is found the Horn of Valere long thought only legend the Horn which will raise the dead heroes of the agesAnd it is stolen  Day  of WoT  buddy reread in    Were only reading one book per month so if you want to jump in youve got plenty of time to squeeze in The Eye of the World and still participate Reviewed by NOTICE this reread is in preparation for finally biting the bullet and reading book  That means I HAVE NOT read book  yet Please be mindful of this in the comments both for me and for others who may or may not have progressed past this point in the series Thank youFor whatever reason this is the installment thats held up the least well for me Not bc its not awesomeit absolutely isbut bc even MORE awesomeness is IMMINENT And I know it bc fiendish rereader SO We have a Dragon Reborn and a Wolfbrother but whats behind door  raises hand bc I know I know sighsThe Great Hunt is a concept that can be found in numerous mythologies but not surprisingly my favorite versions have always been the ones with Fae rootsIf youre unfamiliar its fairly simple if the moon is particularly bright and you hear a horn sounding in the distance DO NOT LEAVE THE SAFETY OF YOUR HOME Bc Fae on horsesthatdontgettired with houndsthathavesupersenses and may or may not have been human at some point are out and about hunting big game and NO GOOD can come of you getting caught up in that shit Jordans version is pretty nifty too The Horn of Valere prophecied to be found just before the Last Battle will call the greatest heroes who have ever lived to fight on behalf of the hornsounder    whatever their intent may be    YES you read that correctly The greatest heroes of legend will be compelled to fight for either good or evil depending on who gets their grubby lips on it first So thats exciting Which is kind of impressive if you think about it a hunt for a brass instrument vs a hunt for human prey But yeah   goosebumpsBUT If Im being honest there are a couple of legitimate reasons that I didnt like this installment quite as much as the last one You know beyond being impatient for my favorite character to stop being an adolescent idiot Like Lanfear One of Forsaken Lanfear has been used as a boogieman to scare children into behaving a concept that I find horrific incidentally    Does anyone actually do that Tell their children that some super scary monsterperson will get them while theyre sleeping if they dont do as theyre told I sincerely hope not    Anyway this early in the series the Forsaken are mostly feared for nebulous followeroftheDarkOne reasons However    we do learn a few things about Lanfear Before Lews Therin the Dragon met and married his wife Ilyena Lanfear had been his lover Ultimately    the reason she joined the dark side is bc hell hath no fury    YES seriously    And she wants him back Does not care that the Dragon Reborn is a completely different maybe twentyyearsold model when she herself probably had a couple of centuries under her belt before she was sealed inside the Dark Ones prison for several thousand yearsIf that wasnt obnoxious enoughand trust me it isshe still hasnt figured out that it was her obsession with power and acquiring ALL OF IT that drove Lews Therin away the first time So we get to watch her numerous failed attempts to entice Dragon Reborn into seeking glory for himself Its just sad I mean really    how can she claim to love him yet willfully know nothing about himThen there are the Seanchan    and the Seanchan freak me the hell out Besides practicing numerous and varied types of slavery which shows a terrifying lack of regard for human life    These people arent just ethnocentric theyre an entire population brainwashed into wholeheartedly believing in the superiority of specific types of people and the inferiority of others    oO Right So in addition to that theyve tamed monsters like grolm bearsized threeeyed beasts with grayish green lizardlike impossible to penetrate with things like swords or arrows hide and sharp hooked beaklike mouths to the point of riding them like horses And what do they wear when they ride their pet monsters Metal armor lacquered and segmented to look like an insect carapace    to better match the mandibles and feelers on their helmets    Ye godsI dont know about you guys but I cant come up with a scarier image than a GIANT INSECT riding some kind of prehistoriclooking monster into battle Oh and the ground might just swallow you whole before you even get a chance to defend yourself bc wielders of the One Power Yeah theyre one of the MANY previously mentioned enslaved people groups Still a fantastic installment though PLUS whispers I may not have mentioned it but WoT  brings ALL KINDS of awesome so gird your loins little fishy    and keep on swimminMy other reviews for this series          Highlightsview spoiler Lan with Rand before audience with AmyrlinForsakenview spoiler Foresightview spoiler

  And it shall come to pass that what man made shall be shattered and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of Age and the Dark One shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man Women shall weep and men quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth Neither shall anything stand nor abideThe Great Hunt begins right where The Eye of the World left off with our heroes still sheltering within the walls of Fal Dara But soon enough the fragile peace is shattered The Amyrlin Seat arrives from Tar Valon with dozens of Aes Sedai by her side The Horn of Valere is mysteriously stolen from within the keep itself along with the terrible dagger from Shadar Logoth And from the borderlands in the far north a new journey begins to recover what was stolenAlready in the first few pages of the prologue the reader is made aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows The darkfriends are everywhere Nobles from all across the nations secretly serve the Great Lord of the Dark Even the Children of the Light have been infiltrated by the servants of the Shadow And in the halls of Tar Valon roams the Black Ajah an eight Ajah and a secret fraternity containing those of the Aes Sedai who have given themselves to the Dark OneWhile the battle rages on between light and shadow new forces emerge on the horizon to make their impact on the world In the east groups of Aielmen come out of the Spine of the World in search of the Dragon Reborn On the western shores the Seanchan claiming to be the descendants of Artur Hawkwings armies arrive from beyond the Aryth ocean to conquer the world once more And in Cairhien Daes daemar the Great Game is being played by the noble houses with increasing brutality and ruthlessness and the threat of civil war is becoming more and more realIt is never over alThorThe characters are what really shape this book for good or ill and one of the most interesting characters from the world of the Wheel of Time is Padan Fain From being a seemingly mad darkfriend in the dungeons of Fal Dara he is sprung from his prison when the Horn is stolen and after going along with the group of Trollocs and darkfriends for a while he assumes leadership of it by nailing a Myrddraal to a village wall From that point on Fain becomes a villainous mastermindThe matter of the main characters is sadly enough a totally different one On the positive side Mat and Perrin seem to be improving by each passing chapter Egwene is as she was in the first book a dull uninteresting character with not much of a personality at all And Nynaeve continues to astound me with her uncontrollable temper and her completely unfounded hatred towards MoiraineNevertheless there is only one reason why this book got only four stars from me and that reason even has a name Rand alThor I know some of you who read this will not agree with what Im saying but so far Rand is just the worst main character Ive ever read about He refuses to acknowledge the truth of anything he shuns and apparently even despises those who would help him and accuses them of trying to use him and hes blind towards being manipulated by mostly everyone else Nynaeve can be quite irritating occasionally but Rand constantly left me wanting to throw the book in a wall somewhereFortunately there are more than enough interesting supporting characters to read about Geofram Bornhald such a rarity as a benevolent Whitecloak commander the beautiful and mysterious lady Selene encountered by Rand and Loial in a different world Bayle Domon Verin Sedai and many moreThe Great Hunt is in most aspects a better book than The Eye of the World The writing is flawless and both the storyline and the setting is perhaps even more interesting in the second volume than in the first I considered giving this book five stars like I gave that one but in the end I came to the conclusion that Rand alThor alone was by far enough reason to remove one star at points when reading I was wondering if this was a threestar read and other main characters were not good enough for a fivestar rating either In the end though the book was entertaining enough with a great ending and it managed to build the suspense leading to the next volume in the seriesLet the Dragon ride again on the winds of time                                              This was nowhere near as good as the first novel in the series it completely lacked the initial plot driver that its predecessor wielded Previously the innocent and young protagonists were taken away from their home as they were forced to flee for their lives I wanted to find out exactly why this was going on thus I stormed through it Instead this premise of this book is Rand attempting to escape from his destiny which of course is pure folly because one does not escape fate one does not escape the wheel of time  Reverse character development I was a little disappointed with this because I just dont like reluctant heroes Well at least not in this sense Rand began to annoy me so much at the start of this because by the end of the last novel I felt that he had found his courage and hed overcome his reluctant nature it was like his character development had gone backwards and taken him to an early state of the previous novel Thankfully this didnt last too long as the wheel forced him to act he had to become the dragon reborn otherwise he would have fallen to his enemy Im glad he found his bravery again But I felt like he had already gained it and that this novel was padded out with development that had already been achievedRands full potential is obviously something his not fully aware of although it is clear to the reader and every other character he may encounter of what he will day be able to do Its like he is the only person in this world who doesnt truly see what he is and what he is capable of its beginning to feel a little idiotic When he chases after the horn during the great hunt the depths of his powers begin to unravel along with the true nature of this series He is learning who he is again for the second time I do hope the author doesnt back track like this again because I want to enjoy this series completely and whole heartedly instead of having my precious reading time wasted with repetetive material  This isnt just Rands story thankfully Many of the side characters form the last novel are beginning to develop more of their own personal story arcs I think this made the story much stronger because if this was just about Rand exclusively Id honestly stop reading Through doing this the author is slowly revealing some of the mysteries of his fantasy world Nynaeve had many point of view chapters as did Egwene I think this is the start of a transition away form a Rand central novel Hopefully they will be just as important to the overall plot as this reluctant hero Hes a rather tepid protagonist and at this point I think he needs a reason to face his destiny Perhaps hes relatives should die or one of his friends to give him a reason to fight However despite more point of view characters I think the chapter placement was incredibly poor and plain frustrating What I mean is that there were four to five chapters of Rands story in one massive bulk this was then interrupted by a single or sometimes double chapter from another point of view It would then go back to Rand I think the story would have flowed much better if Rands chapters were broken up a little more and had no more than two or three chapters together The result of placing chapters in the way that Jorden did is not seeing what happened to Mat and Perrin for almost three hundred pages I found this very annoying I dont think this book was well paced at all Is this still perfect fantasy Despite my grievances with the protagonist and chapter placement I still think this is a great series This is everything I like in epic fantasy and hopefully will continue to be so The magic system is complex and interesting and the different races are diverse and well thought out The complexity of this fantasy universe is what makes this series enjoyable for me I just hope that Rand retains the character development he has gained twice because if I have to read more about his reluctant nature and him trying to run away I may come to view this series as unnecessarily packed out Hopefully that wont happen but time will tell This was not as accomplished as the first novel but was enjoyable to an extent it may be just the side characters that saved this book for me However I do think this series creates a lot of apprehension to how it will all end and where the characters will end I find books like this tend to be somewhat predictable but I havent that with the  Wheel of Time so far Im not entirely sure how it will end but I do want to see Mordeth again And it would also be nice to see more of Perrin my favourite character because in this novel he felt like furniture The Wheel of time   Eye of the World An unoriginal five stars The Great Hunt A reluctant three stars The Dragon Reborn A welldeveloped four stars     If youve read a few reviews by me you might know that Im a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson  This is one reason that  is the year of the Wheel for me since Sanderson finished out this series As I move along in this series I can see how BS got some of his roots from Jordan They distinctively have different voices to be sure but one of the reasons Im enjoying The Wheel of Time series is because of the intricate world building that is going on and the layers that are being set upThis book is over twenty years old but you cant really tell and that is one of the coolest things about fantasy is they can stand up to the test of time since there is an entire new world in every single one and so it never really feels datedThe Eye of the World reminded me of The Lord of the Rings in quite a few ways and while for the most part The Great Hunt is moving away from that feeling there is still one part that very much reminded me of Tolkien The Great Hunt is all about the Horn of Valere Whoever blows the horn calls an army of dead heroes to fight with themIm pretty sure I saw that somewhere elseBut that is about the only thing that really reminded me of LotRs this time around The world continues to get a little bigger for our group from The Two Rivers There are new people customs places and danger seems to be EVERYWHERE It seems that most of the book is about Rand since he seems to be the very reluctant and ridiculously stubborn hero Temptations abound as various characters try to pull him into their machinations including a new beautiful woman Selene I hated her immediately and seriously why does every woman except Nynaeve of course need to be in love with Rand Why cant Perrin or Mat find someone interested in them I was sure I knew who she really was from the beginning and that can be nothing but trouble for Rand so I hope all the stubbornness pays off in the endRand struggles with the fate that keeps calling him He is so hell bent on going the opposite direction the Aes Sadai wants him to go he is easy to manipulate   All the people from the Two Rivers seem to be incredibly nave except Nynaeve and I cant help but yell at them sometimes in my head for the choices they makeWhile Rands Journey was pretty interesting especially to the final showdown in the book I liked learning about the rituals and training of the Aes Sadai more Nynaeve and Egwenes time at the white tower and after was probably the most interesting part of the story for me Learning what trials Nynaeve had to go through for part of her training was so intense and actually a little heartbreaking  But the run in with the Seanchan and learning what they do with women who can channel was the most horrible and intense thing in the book for me Egwene and Nynaeve have come far from where they started out and Im very interested in seeing what becomes of them as the books continueBest side character for me is Loial The Ogier is a great addition and I really enjoyed going into another stedding and meeting a few other Ogier Plus could it be that Loial might have a crush If that wasnt the cutest thing ever I dont know what itA few issues I hadThey are really silly but I find this with quite a few older high fantasy novels People know each other for a few pages and BOOM they are in love or speaking of marriage and such Lan and Nynaeve are a good example of this I like that they have this longing and forbidden romance of sorts happening between them Im a girl and I really like a little romance with my fantasy but I also like a little build up Still at least there is a little bit on the romance side of life and I am rooting for them even though there wasnt much build up  The other issue I sometimes have is that it seems like every core member suffers from what my friend Gavin coined quite well Two Rivers Idiocy At some key moment in the book one of the crew from The Two Rivers will do something that is completely stupid Hey we need to sneak out of here under no circumstances use magic Two paragraphs later Draws in all the magic to use it sighOverallThis is good Epic High Fantasy Sure there are smaller stories arcs being told but there are prophecies to be confronted and evil to destroy There are epic journeys that need to be taken and bad guys all over the place some of them even think they are the good guys White Cloaks Im looking at youIf you enjoy epic journeys then this series seems to be exactly what you are looking for Plus good news is that it is finished no waiting years between booksAudio Note Kate Reading and Michael Kramer who also do The Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson wink wink are fantastic This is very well performed if you are a fan of audio   What a book What an amazing journey Such an epic endingTakes calming breaths I loved this book even more than the first one in the seriesThe Great hunt begins exactly where The Eye of the World left off So much happens in this second book I was locked in suspense for the entirety of this novel especially at the endNew forces with monstrous creatures and terrible weapons emerge out of seemingly nowhere and shake the foundation of nationsNew threats are added to the old ones The Darkfriends are everywhere from nobles of many different nations to Children of the Light and even the Aes SedaiAielmen finally make an appearanceWe get to learn more about the Ogier race their steddings and their traditionsDaes daemar the Great Game played by the noble houses of Cairhien is introducedAnd much moreThis is one amazing Epic fantasy A journey into a wellthought universe with a very complex and intriguing magic system and compelling characters that come from many different nations and races A mustread for fantasy fans The length of these books no longer intimidate me I cant wait to read the next book   "},

"author": "Robert Jordan",
"text": "The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go leaving memories that become legend Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again In the Third Age an Age of Prophecy the World and Time themselves hang in the balance What was what will be and what is may yet fall under the Shadow The first series that showed it was possible to rewrite Tolkien and make a mint was Shannara After that the doors were flung wide open and the next to take advantage was Robert Jordan Of course all authors take some inspiration from older works as Virgil did to Homer and Milton to Virgiland as Tolkien himself drew on the Norse Eddas and Welsh mythsBut when Tolkien and Virgil set out to write their great works they expanded and changed what came before and made it their own with a unique voice and vision Jordan didnt have the knowledge of language history or culture to truly copy Tolkiens style nor was he able to add a unique spinThe Eye of The World is a more accessible version of Tolkien but Tolkien is already a simplified version of the Norse Sagas meaning that Jordan felt a need to dumbdown the accessible which doesnt leave his book with much personalityHowever unlike other authors who choose a more straightforward take on Fantasy Jordan kept the plodding length of Tolkien It is difficult to comprehend how such a simple familiar story could take so long to tell Without the strange and engaging details of Tolkiens meticulouslydeveloped world Jordan lacks any of the complexity that might bolster such a longwinded style Its clear that hes trying to build a massive detailed world but its not an interesting original world It wouldnt be so bad if the lengthy asides were interesting in and of themselves If each little piece was amusing in its own right we might forgive But instead we get dry lengthy explanations of extraneous facts that we have no reason to be curious aboutSome point out that these facts show up in later books of the series which is probably true but then what are they doing in this book If Mary first appears in book three it is not useful or interesting to stop in the middle of book one and tell us she has blonde hair Facts should not be evenly distributed throughout a series they should be placed in close proximity to scenes that relate to them That way they make sense to the reader and we have a reason to care about themIf an author has to stop the story every few paragraphs to explain whats going on thats a sign that his writing is simply not working The world should be revealed to us through characters through their interactions through small details of verisimilitude and with scenes designed specifically to illustrate a point without losing focusBut Jordans characters are dull and shallow his dialogue bland and his plot though it possesses many parts has few twists We are given an unending parade of new characters and detailed digressions which masterfully suck all the drive purpose and life from the storyAt half the length the book would have been merely another twostar fantasy rehash At a third the length it might have started to show some pep But Jordan had to stretch out his alltofamiliar story to doorstop proportions Since he didnt add anything new or successfully copy the artistry of Tolkiens dense prose he succeeded only in telling a short story in a long bookIn Tolkien the first hundred pages takes place in quaint Hobbiton This prelude prepares us for the rest of the book allowing us to understand the strange world and characters and setting a mood When the action takes us away we find we had become attached to the bucolic charm of Hobbiton sicklysweet as it may sometimes be But when we do depart the world we meet is much grander in comparison In Eye of the World you spend the first hundred and fifty pages in a drab farming community so that when they finally leave it will seem like something is happening This is only a clever illusionThe hero is an orphan who looks different he gets his fathers magic sword he goes on a quest with an old wily man gets attacked by evil darkskinned mongoloids meets the princess by accident becomes embroiled in an ancient prophecy discovers a magic force which controls fate and the plot c c Stop me if youve heard this one before Like a lot of modern fantasy the plot and characters are nothing new Every fantasy fan has read this same story again and again from countless authorssome apparently on purposeTheres no reason for this sort of repetition a new book should be more than just fanfic of an older book There are countless different influences out there even before Tolkien touched pen to paper there was Lord Dunsany The Worm Ouroboros H P Lovecraft H Rider Haggard Robert E Howard Kipling Ariosto Spenser and E Nesbit to name a fewContemporary with and after Tolkien there are Mervyn Peake Michael Moorecock and Fritz Leiber There is no reason for writing the same stories over and over when there are so many different inspirations out there It is especially inexcusable when an author does this with mindnumbing longwindednessAlso like most fantasy authors Jordan seems to have a problem writing female characters They are either whiny and snotty or emasculating ice queens I couldnt count on both hands the fantasy authors who seem to think strong woman means insufferable unapologetic shrew Then again the male characters arent much betterIve also been lead to understand that later on in the series we get a magical band of lipstick lesbians who go straight when they grow up and meet real men like our heroes and some stuff about naked public spanking thats not a jokeI wish it were But I suppose that if Jordan resembles other genre writers in terms of plot length setting and character he might as well go all the way and throw in some misguided gender inequalityAnd as the series goes on the many problems with pacing plotting and unfocussed asides only grow worse If Jordan cant keep everything straight in his opening book how will he possibly deal when the story starts branching out as stories tend to do It is hardly surprising that such a tenuous grasp will inevitably slip awayUPDATE one might point to the endless repetition in modern literature as a sure sign that there is no God no grand plan and no purpose to the universe A benevolent power would surely spare us the pain of such unending mediocrityHowever if there were some deity and he had a sense of humor he would allow the uncreative authors to publish to gain fame until their series piled selfindulgently to the length of a minor encyclopedia then let the author announce that he is finally approaching The End only to perish on the cuspSince this is precisely what happened I will have to keep an eye out for other signs of this humorous demiurge possibly in the form of miraculous banana peels and hagiographic fright wigsMy Fantasy Book Suggestions   Paternity leave reading for  am crying jags Mine and hersThere Brian I read it Are you happyMy friend Brian has been telling me to read The Wheel of Time for years It always went like this Brian You should read The Wheel of Time Its really goodMe Ive heard that it gets really really bad B The first seven books are really outstandingM Yeah Im not going to read seven books without an endingB The first one is good but the second one is betterM Mmm I dont knowB The first one stands alone really well Retrospective commentary NO IT DOESNTM OK lemee borrow itSeveral months passM Here is your book backB Oh you read itM NoI really thought I was never ever going to start this series Everything I read about it screamed at me to run away Tolkien pastiche Incredibly long Characters with stupid names Lots of worldbuilding The main villain is called The Dark One WTF trollocsI have nothing against multivolume wordbloated epic fantasy Not really Well kind of but I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt George RR Martin that one Brandon Sanderson book I liked But even the people who like The Wheel of Time also seem to apologize for doing so or outright resent it for what it became in the draggy middle So why do I want to start reading it If someone told me a show about a mysterious island was really entertaining and interesting for a while there but then totally peed the ending down its leg and really thats a PRETTY BIG DEAL for a mystery show even one that is purportedly focused on a bunch of unlikeable assholes characters first would I immediately run home and start watching that show on Netflix streaming No because Im the idiot who watched it all along assuming I wasnt wasting my time I think I am getting off trackSo I wasnt going to read this But then I was off work for a few weeks on paternity leave and my daughter was waking up five times a night and I was unable to sleep even though at that point I didnt really have much to offer that she was interested in and I had a copy of The Eye of the World that I absorbed for a quarter somewhere and Ive always had a thing for the goofy cover art So I picked it up at  am and read the prologue And it was pretty much what I expected what with the stupid names and bad dialogue But it was also kind of fun Of course I also knew based on reading a bunch of reviews and blogs about this book series I never planned to read that the next  pages were going to be in the tradition of Hobbiton Chapter One Concerning Ensuring Joel Will Never Read Past the First Section of This Book horrifically boring So I almost put it back downThen I remembered that my brother had the book in his Audible account and that my phone lets you listen to books at double speed meaning Id get through the hour production in roughly  That sounded about right  the auditory equivalent of skimming except I actually got really good at listening that quickly you just kind of have to get in the zoneAnd it was exactly as Id been led to believe clumsy repetitious prose a few times I had to make sure the audio track wasnt repeating as the same dialogue and phrasing was repeated over and over Meandering pacing and haphazard plotting nothing happens nothing happens SOMETHING HAPPENS same thing happens five more times nothing happens rushed climax cliffhanger Bland heroes though in their defense they are stupid teenagers Blatant Tolkien ripoffery OH MY GOD THE DAGGER IS OBVIOUSLY CURSED YOU IDIOTS And my favorite the pauses for selfindulgent infodumps the best one comes in one of the last chapters and throws in so many weird names and covers so much time I have absolutely no idea what happened and why it mattered enough to put the climax on hold The unsatisfying ending the last chapters are rushed drop in a few villains out of the blue only to defeat them a few pages later via a magical object that isnt mentioned until page  even though its the freaking titleBut Um I kind of liked it The world is pretty interesting I like the way Robert Jordan sketches out the history even some of the infodumps are fun I like his magic system and the powerful women who are feared and respected for tapping into it I dont strictly care about the heros journey at its core but the weight  the epicness  of it all Once the big lumbering thing gets moving it really has momentumSo heres where the real test comes Do I read the second book No I do notDo I listen to the second book at chipmunk speedI really kind of want to But doing that will only make me want to read book three and like poor Rand alThor accidentally touching the tainted power of saidin dammit Brian see what you did that way lies madness and deathMaybe if Josh has an extra Audible credit    One down FOURTEEN to go cackles maniacally Oh calm down One book per month is totally doable If you want in on the    action visit the group page linked above and request to join The more the merrierReviewed by NOTICE this reread is in preparation for finally biting the bullet and reading book  That means I HAVE NOT read book  yet Please be mindful of this in the comments both for me and for others who may or may not have progressed past this point in the series Thank youIts hard for me to review this book and only this book objectively bc WoT is my favorite high fantasy series Ever Ive read the first eight books seven or eight times maybe more whispers I honestly dont know how many times Ive read them DONT JUDGEThe first time I was nineteen Ish I read all of the available books backtoback schoolwork be damned Then I read them again YES really And I loved them even more the second time I thrive on detail you see And Robert Jordan was a master of details I caught so many previously missed foreshadowings clevernesses nuances etc that had flown right over my head the first time It was spectacular Like when Thom Mat and Rand jumped aboard Bayle Domons ship and Thom spun a tale for the captain explaining how they happened to come upon his ship with Trollocs nasty manbeast things on their heels  Bc didnt know it at the time but Domon is an    wait for it    Illianer tips hatThe whole series is FULL of things like thatRand alThor Mat Cauthon and Perrin Aybara are three young men on the cusp of adulthood They live in Emonds Field where they have small village concerns and small village livesBut when the previously mentioned Trollocsattack their village it forces them to accept that such creatures of the Dark One are not mere stories made up to scare children And when the two strangers who arrived just prior to the attack turn out to be an Aes Sedai wielder of the One Power and her Warder warriorprotector the manboys learn that a small village life is not in the cards for them HA and are forced to leave their homes to protect their families from the Great Lord of the Darks minions who wont stop until all three are in their masters graspJordan does an excellent job of keeping you guessing which manboy is the Dark One after and why Is it really just the one or is it all of them If it is all of them are they all equally important or do the degrees vary WHAT DOES IT ALL MEANBc this is not a simple story And one thing we do know is that Rand Perrin and Mat are taveren and as such they unwittingly pull others into their quest a somuchmorethanasimple gleeman whose past regrets dictate his future actions a young Ogier whose curiosity and wanderlust led him to leave his peaceful stedding home to see the things hes spent his life reading about Rands sweetheart who refuses to be left behind and longs to become an Aes Sedai herself and the village Wisdom who feels compelled to both protect the young people from Aes Sedai machinations and also to break through the Warders walls Among many others Each and every one of them vital in their own wayAlso vital are the multitudes of seemingly random observations and commentary that in reality are the foundations of awesomeness to come THESE BOOKS    layers and layers and still more layers Its truly incredibleAnd despite having read The Eye of the World so many times that I practically have it memorized I have yet to grow immune to the very real and heartbreaking struggles that many of the characters face Whether its Rands terrible journey from his farm in the Westwood to Emonds Field dragging his injured father to safety Loials treesong to preserve a small part of his Treebrothers sanctuary in the Blight or Nynaeves yearning for a man bound to a neverending battle that he cannot win    I still feel it rubs fist over heart DeeplyAnd if you are unaffected by Moiraines tale of the long fallen Manetheren  then you have only a black shriveled thing in your chest cavity SO As daunting as this series may be and I will never deny that it is daunting    if you are a lover of fantasy and you havent read Robert Jordans Wheel of Time you are doing yourself a major disservice The Eye of the World has the best prologue Ive ever read IN MY LIFE so I challenge you to read it Its just a prologue And if you dont feel the need to see what happens next then hey    all youre out is the  minutes it took you to read it ALSO no one is holding a gun to your head Theres no law that says once you start you cant stop until THE END Take your time Enjoy it Or dont Whatever But my recommendation is that you do These are the books that spawned my love of reading fantastical things as a adultMy other reviews for this series           Highlightsview spoiler EPIC prologue from Age of LegendsForsakenview spoiler Foresightview spoiler Musingsview spoiler It makes

  And the Shadow fell upon the land and the world was riven stone from stone The oceans fled and the mountains were swallowed up and the nations were scattered to the eight corners of the World The moon was as blood and the sun was as ashes The seas boiled and the living envied the dead All was shattered and all but memory lost and one memory above all others of him who brought the Shadow and the Breaking of the World And him they named DragonAnd it came to pass in those days as it had come before and would come again that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men and the green things failed and hope died And men cried out to the Creator saying O Light of the Heavens Light of the World let the Promised One be born of the mountain according to the prophecies as he was in ages past and will be in ages to come Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark and the great sword of justice defend us Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of timeI have read a lot of books throughout my mere twenty years of life Some deeply fascinating others not so much And every once in a while I am able to lay my eyes on something truly extraordinary One of those is definitely The Eye of the World by Robert JordanThis is not a book turning fantasy literature on its head or even providing the genre with major changes When reading it I was quite easily able to find strong similarities with lots of previous works of fantasy and science fiction including The Lord of the Rings Dune and Shannara It is not among the most innovative books I have read It is not among the most exciting books I have read It is however a stunning work of pure quality which deserves to be read by all fantasy enthusiasts out thereI do not intend to write in great lengths about the story and the characters in this review and I feel that I have already mentioned what needs to be mentioned Most of you have already read this book Those who have not should really take the time and effort to do so It is absolutely worth itWhen I had read more books in the series it had grown more and more in my estimate Even at that early stage this was definitely one of my favourite fantasy series ever And definitely the best example of fantasy worldbuilding since Tolkien At that point I was starting to wonder whether I actually considered it better than even my beloved A Song of Ice and Fire but only time would tell thereAfter two years of reading the longest I have ever spent on one single story I have reached the end And because of my neverending obsession with favourites I can finally make the official statement Wheel of Time is my favourite fantasy series of all time That still means it is surpassed by Tolkiens works which do not make up a series but this is just about the highest praise I can giveIt has its boring parts just as it has its brilliant parts It has endless descriptions of braintugging and Jordans ridiculously annoying battle of the sexes It has the worst protagonists I have ever met in fictional literature And so much more But I dont careBecause it also has the most magnificent setting you could possibly imagine It has brilliant characters wondrous and fantastic places and deep and thrilling backstories wherever you turn Not to even mention Robert Jordans astounding writingThe best part about Wheel of Time is that it gives me a feeling only one book has been able to give me before One It should be needless to name that one but this is definitely high praise coming from meSo treat this series like an exquisite wine Save it for the perfect occasion and then savour every drop It can be a challenge to get through but it is definitely worth itThis is in my eyes fantasy as it should be writtenThe Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes againNote Review updated and expanded                                               Book One of my epic buddy read of the Wheel of Time series with Thats not in the book I just made that up myself Dont worry Robert Jordans writing isnt nearly as cheesy as mineLife in the village of Emonds Field had always been peaceful Sure the people sometimes argued as families do from time to time But ultimately the village was a tightknit community and people rarely left since they had everything they needed at home It was a quiet life but a fruitful one One where people felt safe enough to leave their doors open to everyone secure in the knowledge that the greatest evil in the world the one most people only refer to as the Dark One rather than daring to even speak its name was safely locked up and could no longer hurt them Im actually writing this review long after reading the book and truth be told I still havent been able to wrap my head completely around it Robert Jordans worldbuilding is so vast and intricate it takes time to be able to absorb it all His lush descriptions of the environment bring his words to like so effectively you sometimes feel like youre living the book rather than reading it But I think the books greatest strength is its main characters who Ill be discussing in order of my own personal preferenceMoiraine  Whatever the Dark One wants I oppose so hear this and know it true Before I let the Dark One have you I will destroy you myselfMoiraine is part of a society of magic wielders called the Aes Sedai Later books get more into the various factions of the Sedai and the ideological differences between them all but mostly what were told about the Sedai in this volume is that many people fear themand they may be right in doing so Strong in mind spirit and ability Moiraine is a commanding yet charming presence from the moment she arrives at Emonds Field Her magical powers and sense of authority reminded me of Tolkiens Gandalfright up until the point where Moiraine promised the boys she would murder them if it was the only way to keep the Dark One from claiming them Thats when I realized Moiraine is really more like Gandalf if Gandalfs contingency plan was to throw Frodo into volcano along with the Ring if he had toOf course if anyone earned the right to throw Frodo into the fire it was SamNynaeve  Perrin talking about Nynaeve You think a little thing like a sunken ferry could stop herKnown as The Wisdom of Emonds Field Nynaeve mostly acted as a healer and a mediator during her time there Ill be honest at first I found Nynaeve a little abrasive Not only does her temper cause her to hurt people with her words sometimes she even hits them with a large stick and what first felt like tough love starts to feel more like a WrestleMania event For the record if Nynaeve was a pro wrestler shes so tough she would win every match no matter who was actually scripted to win However when a group of Two Rivers villagers leave with Moiraine Nynaeve travels many miles and face many dangers just to bring them back While the others are mostly motivated by selfpreservation Nynaeves main concern was to protect the people of her village How could I not admire Nynaeve after that She started out one of my least favorite characters and by the books end had become one of my favorites insteadRand  A fine day for going unnoticed I might as well carry a signMost of the book is told through Rands POV and it was through him that I felt Jordan pulled off his best writing trick Rand is very different from most fantasy novel heroes Whereas most fantasy protagonists tend to be swashbuckling Rand manages to beuh whatever the exact opposite of swashbuckling is Unswashbuckling If hes running across a acre field that has only one rock in it you can bet Rand will manage to trip over that rock If a stranger holding a warhammer asked Rand Would you please follow me into this trap Rand will be there right behind him At times Rand made me want to scream But I also recognized that that was due to the brilliance of Robert Jordans writing Rand acts exactly like what hes supposed to be a sheltered innocent boy who is in way over his head Add to that his affable personality and its impossible not to like himwhich makes it even harder to watch when he manages to blunder into a lifethreatening situation for the th time that chapterLan  Anything can be a weapon if the man or woman who holds it has the nerve and will to make it soJimi HendrixSean ConnerySamuel L Jacksonsome people were just born to be coolThis is NOT one of those peopleStrong and stoic Lan makes an impression as soon as he arrives with Moiraine While Moiraine is really the more powerful of the two Lan is still the more intimidating one Whats even more impressive is that Lan manages to be badass not in what he says but in what he DOESNT say Lan rarely feels the need to threaten anyone as one look into his eyes tells people youre more likely to survive a  foot drop sans parachute than a fight with him Lan is so confident he never feels the need to prove himself to anyone and as a result he never loses his cool In fact he manages to be even cooler than Sean Connery and Samuel L Jackson combined But not Jimi Hendrixeven in a fantasy novel someone being cooler than Hendrix is just too farfetchedPerrin  Leaders in stories never had to put up with this sort of thingOf the three Emonds Field boys that travel with Moiraine Perrin is the most compassionate Physically stronger than the other two but also kinder in nature Perrin is very likable Awkward but likeable In these types of novels the characters usually have to get used to the idea of killing their enemies right away but what makes Perrin stand out is that he NEVER gets used to it Facing so many dangerous foes in order to survive Perrin may have to fight but he doesnt have to like itEgwene  No one tells us how to be men We just areEgwene managed to charm me even though she really has the weakest motivation in the story While the boys of Emonds Field are running for their lives and Nynaeve is pursuing them to try to protect them Egwene says shes tagging along because she wants adventure You would think after her village was ransacked the night before the ol adventure meter would have been full already Of course its entirely possible Egwene was really just going with them because she was concerned about the boys but that theory is somewhat weakened by the fact that she cant go  seconds without hurling an insult at one of them Still her wit and feisty nature made me like her even in the moments when she was hard to likeLoial  A mob chased me all the way across the city Im afraid I was beginning to get a little upsetSince I said I would talk about these characters in the order in which I liked them the fact that Loial appears secondtolast may seem like a swipe at him but really its a testament as to how great the other characters are Giving new meaning to the phrase gentle giant Loial is a Ogier basically an ogre who would much rather have a book in his hand than a weapon Really the only reason Loial doesnt make quite as much of an impression in the story as the others is because he is introduced much later in the book than everyone elseMat  So youre having trouble with a couple of farmboys Maybe you Darkfriends arent as dangerous as Ive always heardSometimes you wish book characters could come to life because theyre so awesome In Mats case I wanted him to come to life just so I could murder him The only character I couldnt stand Mat manages to exude  times the foolishness of Rand yet  times the charm Hes obnoxious and grating The scariest part is I get the feeling Mat was supposed to be the comic relief character despite the fact that he rarely does anything funny Mat is to comedy what Arnold Schwarzenegger isto comedyIn fairness to Mat Im currently reading Book Three in the series and he does show a good amount of character growth by thenbut that doesnt change the fact that all throughout this book while Mat was being chased by the Dark One I found myself rooting for the Dark OneWhile I loved this book I will say that its not for everyone The worldbuilding is a little clunky at times as Jordan has a tendency to make mentions of characters and places long before they actually appear in the story In some ways this makes the later books more rewarding as things that were left a mystery in book one make much more sense later on Also there are long gaps in the action sometimes so anyone looking for a fastpaced adventure may be frustrated with this one However if youre looking for a rich world to explore filled with compelling characters and Mat then its time for you to journey to the Eye of the WorldPS  Here was my original review I wrote it right after a few GoodReads users got busted for plagiarism and I addressed it in my usual subtle wayI David Green absolutely loved this book Its going right on my favorites shelf which is named David Greens favorites because my name is in fact David Green I cant wait to read the rest of the series which has already been uploaded to David Greens thats me KindleLets see you copypaste THAT review thieves    "},
{"title": "Equal Rites",

"author": "Terry Pratchett",
"text": "On Discworld a dying wizard tries to pass on his powers to an eighth son of an eighth son who is just at that moment being born The fact that the son is actually a daughter is discovered just a little too late The town witch insists on turning the baby into a perfectly normal witch thus mending the magical damage of the wizards mistake But now the young girl will be forced to penetrate the inner sanctum of the Unseen Universityand attempt to save the world with one wellplaced kick in some enchanted shins Reissue I just recently revisited this book after a couple years away from it Whats more Ive just recent reread several of the more recent Witch novels from Pratchett so theyre fresh in my head Granny Weatherwax is one of my favorite characters of Pratchetts and as an author it does me good to see how she began as a character This book has some rough edges Theres nothing wrong with it mind you but it was still very early on in Pratchetts career and it doesnt have the smoothness of his later work Discworld is not nearly as developed and neither is his writing style Granny doesnt have her friend Nanny Ogg as conversational foil and counterpoint in this book and its surprising how much that limits her character Whats more while you can see elements of the character Granny eventually becomes theres a surprising streak of country bumpkin in here here In later books she loses most of that which is for the best and while she may not be worldly she is still selfposessed and wise Another interesting echo is the relationship between Granny and Esk Twenty years later Pratchett brought a similar relationship to beautiful fruition with Tiffany Aching As a result this book is merely great rather than utterly brilliant Even roughhewn early Pratchett is better than  of all books out thereAs a side note this is not a bad entry point into reading Discworld Normally I advise people begin at the beginning of the series but despite this being the third book of Discworld it makes for a better start than either of the first two books    If I was not already a Terry Pratchet fan I most definitely am nowEqual Rites Sir Terrys third installment in the Discworld series is a peach of practical magic Telling the story of a young girls conflicting talents for wizardry and  or witcheryIn the Discworld men are wizards and women are witches  at least that is how it has been up to the point when young Eskarina Smith sort of becomes  both Pratchett spins a deliciously tangled web about the ageold contest between the men and the ladies Im not a lady Im a witch said Granny Eskarina may be the protagonist but there is no doubt that Granny Weatherwax stole the show Filling the witch role in the small village of Bad Ass and always appearing in serviceable black Granny kicks ass and takes names throughout the fun narrative I am very pleased to learn that my favorite witch will make many more appearances in Pratchetts series  nine more to be sureA good witching time atop Great ATuin Equal Rites is the best one I have read so far   Executive Summary Not as funny or as quotable as The Light Fantastic but very enjoyable for other reasons  I had to double check the year this was written This book still feels very relevant todayWizards can only be men Witches can only be women Their magic is different and shouldnt be mixed A women has no place learning to be a wizard Witches have their place Does any of this sound familiarAs someone who works in a field that is far too lacking in women the idea that certain disciplines are more suited for men or women is still a stigma we seem to be fighting todayThat isnt to say this book is preachy or in your face about it It simply that the satire is definitely more directed at real world issues than fantasy tropes like the first two books It sounds like this sort of thing is more common in later books so I find it interesting that he changed up the style so early on in the seriesAnd while it wasnt quite as funny to me as The Light Fantastic there were more than a few laugh out loud moments and quotes that I highlighted for laterPlus Granny Weatherwax is a great character Ive read that she changes quite a bit in the Wyrd Sisters and beyond but Im glad I can see how she started out before I jump into thatOverall this book had to do something right because I pretty much tore through it in a weekend which despite its short length is still rather fast for meI already jumped right into Mort as Discworld seems to have its hooks into me right now   Fun readingThis is book one of the Witches segment of Discworld The characters are lively and likable The magic system is comedic with a dark bite Mixed into the slapstick silliness is a grain of philosophy and social commentary that is often highly quotable and thought provokingThe story reads like Wicca meets Harry Potter meets the theory of relativity meets The Dark Crystal I found myself slowing down and rereading sections of the story to make sure I followed it correctly A lot happens in a short period of time in this story and at times I felt like I missed something I read the first Rincewind prior to this and had heard the Witches storyline was better This is only the second discworld book I have read I do like the Witches story slightly better but Rincewind was good also I plan to read both and work my way through this series For years I put off reading these because it didnt really seem like the type of story I would enjoy Im glad because now I have them all ahead of me to read this summer They make nice comedic filler between my more serious reads   A mediocre novel at least for this writer Hes still stretching his wings and it shows this earlier tale contains too much verbal clutter but almost no humor which is abundant in his later novels I like the idea of this one  a female should be allowed to be a wizard Oh yeah Im all for equal rights I dislike the execution though Why did the author make Esk the protagonist an yearold girl She is too young to behave the way she does and to know everything she is supposed to know She shouldve been at least  The book definitely targets adult readers so such a young protagonist doesnt make sense On the other hand Granny Weatherwax the second protagonist and Esks mentor is her usual grumpy and resourceful self a champion of headology which is a philosophy invented by Pratchett I think I like Grannys lectures to Esk    Despite her formidable magical abilities Granny uses headology most of the time and it always works for her and her clients She is one of the best literary witches of the genre and the more I read about her the more I like her Overall impression for Pratchetts purist  a necessary read For the rest  you can skip it There are much better books in the Discworld series    "},

him around every cornerA bluebear has twentyseven lives I shall recount thirteen and a half of them in this book but keep quiet about the rest says the narrator of Walter Moerss epic adventure What about the Minipirates What about the Hobgoblins the Spiderwitch the Babbling Billows the Troglotroll the Mountain Maggot Mine is a tale of mortal danger and eternal love of hairs breadth lastminute escapes Welcome to the fantastic world of Zamonia populated by all manner of extraordinary characters Its a land of imaginative lunacy and supreme adventure wicked satire and epic fantasy all mixed together turned on its head and lavishly illustrated by the author I spent the first  or so pages of this book trying to figure out whether it was a childrens book for very advanced children or an adult book for readers who hadnt lost their sense of play and wonder Its whimsically illustrated audaciously imaginative and has a distinked sic fascination with body odor But to get some of the jokes you need to have a passing familiarity with quantum physics string theory and academic politics Eventually I gave up trying to categorize it and just enjoyed the adventureAs Captain Bluebear the narrator says in the opening chapters this is the story of  of one bluebears  lives The other  Well a bluebear must have his secrets Captain Bluebears adventures include A childhood spent with the Mini Pirates marauders who are always attacking ships but being so small are never noticed A partnership with Deux ex Machina a pterodactyl who saves people from doom at the very last possible second And schooling under the tutelage of a professor with seven brainsI often found myself laughing aloud as I read thinking first You cant do that Then feeling my imagination liberated because Moer had dared to do soA master storyteller and actor Captain Bluebear is ever so slightly pompous but in that adorable way of harmless wellfed scholars whose generous hearts are more than large enough to contain their puffed up egosOne of my favorite books in many years I read it again before the year was out even though I only rarely reread books and this is a formidable  pages Highly recommended   Ehhh If I would have been the editor on this book I would have cut out about oh  pages And I would have asked if maybe just maybe we could work some STORY into the novel Really the book is no more than a catalog of happenstance I did THIS and then THIS happened and after that I went to THIS weird place where I did THIS weird thing Multiply that by some  pages and you have a snorefest Was it wildly inventive Yes it was Were there interesting characters Certainly What about magically intriguing settings and worlds Oh yes they abounded within But was there any point at all No there wasnt It was no more than a collection of ramblings from which a book could be developed if the writer had thought to be a author rather than a notetaker I suppose the most concise review I can give for this book is thisOn my copy of the book pages  were all bound together not having been properly cut apart when the book was printed It made it impossible to read the pages without separating them The books previous owner didnt bother to do so I didnt either    Still love this book  Walter Moers creates a vivid and imaginative universe and stays absolutely true to it to the very end Ive read a number of his books by now and this is definitely the bestI love his way of using the book media to tell his story and though I generally dont care much for illustrations one way or another here they definitely enhance the story The characters are original and well described and the  lives different enough to make for a very interesting story I simply couldnt put the book down but devoured it in  daysIn atmosphere Zamonien reminded me quite a bit of Dystopia although the two books otherwise have nothing in common   What do you get when you put a Blue bear in one of the most wonderfully imaginative worlds I have ever encountered in Fiction In the hands of a master story teller and illustrator like Walter Moers you get a zany and wacky adventure with all manner of creatures both lovable and scary and a reading experience like no other Told almost as a biography of   of Blue bears  lives readers like I are powerless to resistJoining the story with a very young Blue bear adrift floating in frightening seas within a walnut shell He is saved by mini pirate dudes called mini pirates and so begins the the little bears great journey as he faces many troubles and perils along the way From a giant Malestrom in the ocean to the legendary city of Atlantis and everywhere in between we the reader share every every step of Blue bears epic escapadesThere is a certain magic in this book that makes it such a delight to read Part of this is because the world that is created is so rich and vivid and with a whole host of characters that are so memorable and that you come to know and love Youll laugh out loud one minute then be on the edge of your seat the next and even find yourself sad at times It is the sought of story that will also provide a unique expedition into youre own imagination One thing though the cover is quite deceptive This is not a book for young children neither is it a book for all adults but instead it is a book for adults who have not grown up yet like my good self   Bluebear is everything he should be and so much more than I thought he would be Between the cover and the title hell even the synopsis I was up the proverbial shit creek without a paddle when trying to explain to people what my current read was Is that a childrens book Are you high After stumbling and mumbling my way through a couple of barely coherent sentences I would make the second mistake offer them the book One quick flip maybe a pause at a picture or two before gently placing it back into my hands and walking away with a face Im all too familiar with The that girl is not right lookHow does one explain a story such as this I can honestly say I would have never of thought to pick it up Even with the comparisons to other books I love there was just too much out front stacked against it Thankfully a book friend clued me in to its existence and swore to its value because without that I would have definitely missed out on one of the greatest stories I have read in a while I know you are reading this KavitaSo back to my pathetic attempt at explaining Bluebear is a blue bear that happens into existence one day in the middle of the sea His life is instantly thrown into turmoil as he realizes he is on a collision course with a whirlpool Well I say turmoil because you and I would feel that way but not Bluebear Everything is just another life he gets to live one filled with whatever is thrown his way to be thoroughly enjoyed and taken in strideWhy I loved this read Simply everything The writing style is phenomenal the pictures are fun and the layout is different and not too distracting A definite solid five star read   "},

"text": "Just because you cant explain it doesnt mean its a miracle Religion is a controversial business in the Discworld Everyone has their own opinion and indeed their own gods Who come in all shapes and sizes In such a competitive environment there is a pressing need to make ones presence felt And its certainly not remotely helpful to be reduced to be appearing in the form of a tortoise a manifestation far below godlike status in anyones book In such instances you need an acolyte and fast Preferably one who wont ask too many questions This was the first Pratchett book I read and Im glad of it While it has the humor and satire that is inherent in all of the Discworld books it also has something else  something to say It was evident even from the first time I read this book that Pratchett had put some real heavy thinking into itThis book is as the title suggests about gods Where do they come from Where do they go What keeps them moving Ordinarily gods dont like this sort of question People who think are not what gods look for in followers Gods want people who believe Thats where their power comes from Gods with many believers are stong great gods Armies of priests and worshipers attend to their every needs the sacrifices are plentiful and their dominion is vast A great God wants for nothingA god with no believers however is a small god a mindless thought blistering through the firmament searching with singleminded fervor for one thing a believerWhat happens then when a Great God finds out that while he wasnt looking he lost all of his believers Thats the thrust of this tale the story of the Great God Om and how he became a tortoise for three years Its about the difference between what is real and what is believed in and how much difference that can make at times Its about fundamental and trivial truths and how to tell them apart Its about eagles and tortoises and how much they need each otherAbove all its something of in my opinion a statement of faith Many people ask me if I am religious and I tell them no Thats partly due to this book and the thinking that it made me do Spiritual Sure Religious NoThis is as I said the story of the Great God Om who discovered about  feet above the ground that he had been a tortoise for the last three years Before this midair revelation he had been just chewing at melons and wondering where the next lettuce patch was Suddenly all the selfawareness of a Great God was put into his head as well as the knowledge that he was probably about to die Om had intended to manifest as a bull or a pillar of fire  something much more majestic and Godly  but for some reason that hadnt worked He had become a tortoiseNow in the presence of Brutha a novice in the Church of the Great God Om the god remembers who he was and discovers that hes in a lot of troubleThe Church of the Great God Om Theres something to talk about Many people believe upon reading it that its an allegory for the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages The Omnian Church permits no heresy It permits no sin no disbelief Violating the precepts of Om and His Prophets can lead to death in a lingering and painful manner The Quisition cannot be wrong for was it not Om Himself who put suspicion into their minds Its a tactic that has been used by many religions over the years often to justify acts that they know their god would not approve ofI dont believe that Pratchett was trying to take a stab at the Catholics in this book Its just an unfortunate coincidence that the Omnians and the Catholics bear a few points of similarity A rigid hierarchy for example A penchant at one point or another for extracting confessions by any means necessary is another Its all very efficient and effectiveTheres a problem though as is pointed out by Brutha late in the book if you beat a donkey with a stick long enough the stick becomes all that the donkey believes in At that point neither gods nor believers benefit The only people benefiting are those wielding the stick Instead of becoming a tool for inspiration the church becomes a tool for terror People do not obey their god out of love  they obey their church out of fearThis is the kind of church that could produce the Deacon Vorbis head of the Exquisitors He is one of those men who would turn the world on its back just to see what would happen He is everything that is wrong with the Church and unfortunately it seems that he is in line to be the Eighth Prophet In other words Omnia is not a nice place to live Its church is vast its god is small and neighboring nations want to take it down a few pegs Its up to Brutha and his God to change the course of historyAs I said there was a lot of thought put into this novel as well as Pratchetts usual hidden research For example Brutha is called a Great dumb ox by his classmates due to his size and apparent lack of intellect The same epithet was thrown at Thomas Aquinas by his classmates and he was canonized less than a century after his death Like Aquinas Brutha is not dumb He is simply slow and careful in how he thinks and his measured pace leads him far more surely to the truth than the hotheaded and passionate men who march with himSome people read this book as an attack on religion Others see it as a defense of personal faith I think Terry had a story to tell and perhaps a point to make The beauty of books such as these is that they can be whatever you want them to be For me it came as a kind of defense of gods Humans the book suggests need gods Now there is a growing atheist community out there who disagree with that idea and I can definitely see where theyre coming from As Ive said many times Im not entirely sold on the god idea yet But the gods that are rampant in the Discworld arent the kinds of gods that the atheists and the true believers fight over  the omnipotent creator of Everything They are gods who are controlled by humans who exist with humans in a kind of codependent relationship Humans need gods and gods need humans In its way this kind of theology makes gods more realistic to me I cant say for sure whether a god or gods exist but if they did I think I could live with this kind of arrangementWhat this book definitely is in any case is good Very good If you havent read it do so If you have read it do yourself a favor and read it again Around the Godde there forms a Shelle of prayers and Ceremonies and Buildings and Priestes and Authority until at Laste the Godde Dies Ande this maye notte be noticed from the writings of the philosopher Abraxis Small Gods                                                                                                                                          The trouble with being a god is that youve got no one to pray toWhat good is being a god when youre stuck in the body of a lowly tortoise and your only follower is an uneducated melonhoerYep it sucks to be OmNow imagine poor Bruthas disappointment One day hes quietly minding his melons the next hes on some wild adventure with a smart ass tortoise who insists hes a god even though THIS god is NOTHING like the prophets said he would be For one thing he doesnt have horns for another this socalled god cant even remember MEETING the prophetsThe Prophet HashimiWhoa A blasphemous god You dont meet one of those every dayThese little exchanges between Om and Brutha are priceless Opened my eyesmy eyeand I was a tortoiseIve always had a fondness for characters who are forced to hold conversations with entities that no one else can see Hilarity frequently ensues as everyone else assumes youre talking to yourself and therefore just a bit batty Does anyone besides me remember My Partner the GhostThis is not Pratchetts funniest book but theres still a lot to love here Just about everyone and every thing is mocked and thats always good for us all Ill let Brutha have the final wordYou know I used to think I was stupid and then I met philosophersAmen Brother Brutha   If a man lived properly not according to what any priests said but according to what seemed decent and honest inside then it would at the end more or less turn out all right Small Gods is the darkest book in this series so far It is also ridiculously witty and funny if that makes any sense It should for Terry Pratchetts fansHe always pokes fun at one thing or another I think by the end of the series there wont be anything left in this world to be laughed at The main target of Small Gods is organized religion and it is hilarious There is an occasional poke at philosophers and atheists too  Whats a philosopher said Brutha Someone whos bright enough to find a job with no heavy lifting said a voice in his head Still you cant have a story about organized religion and Quisition with its torturing inquisitors and the exquisitors that supervise them without darkness and let me tell you this book has got a truly terrible villain If there werent Om and his curses and threats philosophers and some other characters it wouldnt be as funny as it turned out to be Even the ending is bittersweet because of himOmnia is a onegod country it has Quisition to sort out the infidels and its army to sort out the rest of the world As you may imagine they can be very persuasive because guilt was the grease in which the wheels of the authority turned Vorbis is an exquisitor and one of the worst characters Ive read You see he doesnt even have the twisted justification for torture such as pleasure He would do certain things to another human being or an animal just to see how it behaves Vorbis could humble himself in prayer in a way that made the posturings of powermad emperors look subservient And this man has just decided that Ephebe should get Omnias religion  whether they want it or notEnter Great God Om whose greatest problem right now is that there is only one true believer left in Omnia Brutha is a common young man with an uncommon memory and he gets a surprise when a tortoise appears in his garden When it addresses him in his mind Brutha thinks its a demon Soon he realizes it is the Great God Om who isnt so great as Omnians thought Gods need believers and he has only one Their encounter and the fact that Vorbis recognizes Bruthas memory as something he could use is the base plot of this book There are so many memorable oneliners and paragraphs that it would be too much to put them in one review Besides it would be a shame not to read itOne of the best things about this book is that it doesnt mock beliefs but the way organized religion uses them for its own purposesI loved Oms musings and his interactions with Brutha In the end even Om learned a simple truth if you want thousands you have to fight for one Vorbis on the other hand forgot oneFear is strange soil Mainly it grows obedience like corn which grows in rows and makes weeding easy But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance which flourish underground   Handsdown my favorite DiscWorld novelFrom the perfectly twisted and filigreed mind of Terry Pratchett we have a book that addresses why religion starts stupid and only gets dumber And no religion is sparedBrutha is a childlike novice in his religious order and he will never achieve anything more than novice status Until one day his god literally falls from the sky and realizes that Brutha is the only person in his entire religion who actually believes and isnt just going through the motionsThis is a problem for the Great God Om because a gods power is directly proportional to the number of his believersSomehow Om has got to make Brutha the simpleton into a firebreathing prophet so people will BELIEVE again and restore Oms powerOr else Om is doomed to returning to the desert a wisp of a thought banished with the other Small Gods   "},

"text": "Archswindler Moist Van Lipwig never believed his confidence crimes were hanging offenses  until he found himself with a noose tightly around his neck dropping through a trapdoor and falling intoa government jobBy all rights Moist should have met his maker Instead its Lord Vetinari supreme ruler of AnkhMorpork who promptly offers him a job as Postmaster Since his only other option is a nonliving one Moist accepts the position  and the hulking golem watchdog who comes along with it just in case Moist was considering abandoning his responsibilities prematurely Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again however may be a nearimpossible task what with literally mountains of decadesold undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the brokendown post office building and with only a few creaky old postmen and one rather unstable pinobsessed youth available to deliver it Worse still Moist could swear the mail is talking to him Worst of all it means taking on the gargantuan moneyhungry Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical head Mr Reacher GiltBut it says on the building Neither Rain Nor Snow Nor Glom of NitInspiring words admittedly some of the bronze letters have been stolen and for once in his wretched life Moist is going to fight And if the bold and impossible are whats called for hell do it  in order to move the mail continue breathing get the girl and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every human being not to mention troll dwarf and yes even golem requires hope The mail must get throughHe was part of the government wasnt he Governments took money off people Thats what they were Turns out years spent scamming and conning the public have excellently prepared Moist von Lipwig with the skill set needed to run a vast corporationWho knewMy Discworldreading for the Humour Club has had its ups and downs Some books I loved some bored me to tears one I didnt finish I thrilled to the adventures of the witches laughed at the exploits of the Night Watch and frowned upon the knowitall wizards Seriously could they be more pompous Its like reading a book where every single character is my motherinlaw Yet Ive never rated anything less than three stars because I laughed at least once while reading each book But now  This one is EVERYTHING a Discworld book can be  funny touching clever and thrilling If youre looking to start the series this is a perfect place to jump in Moists efforts to revive the floundering postal service should make you grin and require absolutely no knowledge of previous tales ADDED BONUS  Pratchett has invented possibly the nicest euphemism ever for describing old age  Its good to know Im not decrepit Im just rich in yearsA perfect pickmeup of a read Cole Porter   This book was an excellent surprise I love the Discworld series but was getting tired of seeing the same characters again and again in every book But this book introduces an entirely new and refreshing cast of characters I particularly liked the main character and felt he was very welldeveloped Pratchetts books are funny precisely because he has a very firm grasp of human nature His best work feels surprisingly profound even though youre also laughing so hard youre afraid you might break a rib In some of the later novels I was getting more of a reusedjoke feeling and while it was still pretty funny all the depth was gone In this novel its back and I would rank Going Postal pretty high among the Discworld novelsHighly recommended especially to Pratchett fans who think Discworld has gotten a little stale    I picked up this book to read on a  hour flight from Chicago to Vietnam on the assumption that it would be a light pleasant way to pass the dreary hours after one flight to China during which I watched the first XMen film three times I decided it was best to err on the side of having too many books rather than too few My assumptions proved correct and I enjoyed the book quite thoroughly Three things struck me Pratchetts use of language is always fun and he occasionally makes wonderful jokes that cant be read aloud with the same effect like the store owner who turns up whose speech suffers from greengrocers apostrophes Pratchett typically writes in a third person limited point of view but hes extremely good at getting inside the heads of his characters and changing the voice up The unfortunately named Moist has his own cleareyed perspective on the world that differs from the other denizens of Discworld He manages to weave in quite a bit of history about the postal service I wouldnt have considered it to be an interesting topic for inquiry I mean come on post offices mostly exist to aggrivate people who hate standing in queues right but I was wrongBest vocabulary word gleaned from the text frank meaning to stamp something   This was really surprising actually Perhaps it shouldnt have been given how many people whose opinions I respect are Pratchett fans but I havent read a fantasy novel since giving up on Robert Jordans painstakingly prolonged The Wheel of Time somewhere in book  I think long before college Actually I suppose I read a bunch of the Harry Potters in the interim but in some ways that felt more like keeping up with pop culture than reading actual fantasyIn any event Going Postal was purely a pleasure Compared to the grueling epics I recall from years ago Pratchetts style was brisk and entertaining his humor completely suffusing the tone of the book in a way that reminded me of Douglas Adams approach to science fiction But whereas Adams plotlines can be meandering and perhaps secondary to his constant seeking of the absurd Pratchetts were elaborately coiled wellpaced and compelling and his characters amusing and strange as they often were had a certain sincerity that kept me interested in their welfare Ridiculous name aside Moist von Lipwigs reluctantly scrupulous con artist emphasis on artist as his maneuvering definitely deserves such a word was exceedingly entertaining to followPratchetts underlying thoughts and satire also seemed fairly spoton His commentary on the nature of hope suggests that he would understand why so many underprivileged Americans tend to vote Republican against their best financial interests besides its application in many other areas of human nature and the bits about personal momentum were sufficiently commanding as to grant even the reader a resounding sense of motion and possibility from time to timeI suppose Pratchett may not be to everyones taste and I was not sure he would be to mine but he seems to be very skilled in his particular niche Yes this was very good Mostly just at being a fun diversion but also perhaps as well thought out and gracefully executed literature    I am probably the last person on earth to read Terry Pratchett but Im glad I finally did People have been recommending his books to me for years and although I had planned on starting with book  Color of Magic the bookseller recommended I start with Going Postal instead they were also out of stock of CoM Every time I picked this book up I laughed out loud it has a refreshing wit combined with a sharp perception of people and their funny habits I ate this book up and bought copy of Guards Guards before I finished Whats your favorite Terry Pratchett   "},

killer at loose in your city Except perhaps a serial killer who targets coppers and a city on the brink of bloody revolution The people have found their voice at last the flags and barricades are risingAnd the question for a policeman an officer of the law a defender of the peace isAre you with them or are you against them My favourite Pratchett novel but Im not really sure whyI think that Sam Vimes being in it definitely helps I think my favourite series in the Discworld novels are the City Watch series along with the witches of Lancre and Death His character arc really comes to a head in this one even though he still has another level to go to in ThudI also think that time travel being in it also definitely helps Though not the quantum metaphysical zany fun of Thief of Time though Lu Tze makes an appearance this trip through the Trousers of Time is meaningful poignant even tragicOh I think this was the first Discworld novel to make me cry I dont cry a lot when I read rarely do I even get weepy Discworld always always makes me laugh a lot it makes me want to write wonder think grin ponder mull and all that but this book was the first to make me cryI think this is the first Discworld novel in which I really realized that Pratchett is who I want to be as a writer Night Watch is funny yes its fantasy yes but its more than that Its human It tells a story of being human Pratchett has some great characters with great arcs like Moist in Going Postal and he has some epic meaty stories like Thud with so much behind them you can hardly breathe but Sam Vimes in Night Watch is about as truly human as Pratchett gets And that is probably why this is my favourite Discworld novel   While Terry Pratchett is known for the humor in his Discworld series I enjoy them primarily because while on the surface his books do indeed classify as humor he also writes these almost painful realities very human thoughts and incredibly immersive emotions in situations that you generally dont find in most humorous fantasyscifi which tends more towards parody and caricatures Though I wouldnt exactly say that the Discworld series isnt a parody because his books are parodies or social commentaries They just happen to parody the real world more than parodying the fantasy genreIn the Nightwatch series of books this being the first one you are introduced to a series of ragtag characters who are disrespected and disillusioned Then a Heroic character is introduced into the ranks This Heroic character proves to be the inspiration and catalyst necessary for the members of the Nightwatch to stand up and finally do what they wanted to do somewhere deep in their hearts even if in some characters cases this need was buried very deeply Be upright respectable guards Uphold the law They wanted to make a difference They wanted to matterAnd by the end of the story they doThe conclusion of this story had me nearly in tears it was humble and inspirational and an entirely hilariously exciting read I have so much love for them and their story    from my blog at httpsclsiewertwordpresscomThud ThudIn one timeline thats the name of another Pratchett Discworld novel the th apparentlyThudIn another thats the sound of me marching to my own drumIn yet another thats the sound the vegetables thrown by my bookloving friends make when they hit my hard headBecause honestly this was in between the okay and liked it kind of read for me Given my GR friend average rating of  Im missing something Most likely it is books one through five in the Night Watch subseries of Discworld I did read at least two Vines books Men at Arms and possibly Feet of Clay Or maybe it was that other timeline because it was a really really long time ago and Vines was almost all I remembered remember I told you I often have only foggy details storedNight Watch A Discworld novel in which guardsman Sam Vines learns that Time Travel is Confusing Currently a Baron with time occupied more by meetings than by feeling the city stones beneath his feet Sam Vines is thrown back into history as he attempts to catch a serial killer In an unusual twist Vines will have to play mentor to young Sam Certainly interesting at times philosophical it definitely has a feelgood aspect that helps it go down easily The trouble is much of the story has to do with the history of the city of AnkhMorpork and the various politicking of the rulers and those propping them up and the Night Watchs own role in keeping the peace Certainly a worthwhile topic particularly at this time in American history I cant speak to other countries but the message is incompletely rendered to those unfamiliar with Discworlds intricaciesThe upshotDont listen to me unless you havent read any of the Discworld booksThud   I may have said this when I finished the last Discworld book but this was by far the best Discworld book yet Perhaps the best Pratchett book Ive read I loved it It was not laugh out loud funny the way many of Pratchetts books are but it was so good It was darker delving into the history of AnkhMorpork Discworlds largest city and allowing us glimpses into the past of several repeat characters primarily Sam Vimes Commander of the Night Watch but also Lord Vetinari Patrician of AnkhMorpork and several others Pratchett has an amazing talent at looking at universal themes from a fresh perspective poking fun at our preconceived notions and simply making us think This book looked into the black hearts of men but rather than having to go into gory detail Pratchett knows we can imagine more horrors than he could write and so he leaves us to our own minds This book has such merit I would recommend anyone to read it but you cant fully appreciate its complexities or the heartbreak and challenges of the characters without having read the other books that pertain particularly to the Night Watch Sam Vimes has come such a long way In the first book hes featured in hes a drunk with a horrible outlook on life merely a captain no family no life except for the Watch Now several books and years later he is a Duke the Commander of the Watch sober married and about to have a child I have never seen such redemption in a character and have to wonder if Vimes isnt Pratchetts favorite character Rather than let him stew in his own miserableness as typical cop movies books shows do Vimes rises above his own demons to know another better world and he doesnt sacrifice any of his character to do so I was very much looking forward to reading this book and was never let down    If I could give this book ten stars I would In fact it makes me rethink all of the other books that Ive given five stars perhaps they dont deserve itHeres the problem This book isnt going to have the right impact unless youve read at the very least three of the previous AnkhMorpork Night Watch books Please if you have heard about Pratchett and are looking for some place to start go with Guards Guards or Mort and read a few more before you embark on this one Youll thank me laterThanks to time travel we get to go back in time and see many of our favorite AnkhMorpork characters in the tail end of the bad old days that many would like to forget And its no wonder  AnkhMorpork is ruled by a fascist Patrician who had imposed a citywide curfew and due to his paranoia is having his Unmentionables round up anyone who might be a dissident and torturing them into giving information Vimes chased a totally Bursar criminal with no morals onto the roof of the Unseen University Library and through a freak electrical storm winds up back in the days when he himself was a rookie in the AM Night Watch The criminal Carcer killed the man who Vimes remembered from the time as being his role model John Keel leaving Vimes to step into his place and try to guide the events of the Glorious TwentyFifth of May to their necessary conclusion But could Vimes change the path of history this time and spare the lives of a few good men Or is history doomed to repeat itselfThis is my favorite Discworld novel and that is an incredibly hard title to come by I find it to be incredibly moving and emotional and it makes me cry every time

the ending that book three should have had The first half A Storm of Swords Steel and Snow just wasnt strong enough to stand on its own But thats okay as the second half more than makes up for it From the off there are bodies Not just secondary characters either but people we thought were going to be key players in The GameA number of characters get built out a lot more as well Jamie continues his transition to threedimensions with the start of a conscience Stannis starts to come out of his shell a little and Petyrs role in the history so far starts to make a lot more sense  he did warn us not to trust himAs a combined single book it would have been a five star rating as part two more than rescues any failings in part one I strongly suggest reading them back to back and thinking of them as one logical book if youre going to buy them individually   Oh my bloody hell and fuckDear GeorgeI have read A Game of Thrones A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords one after another and in any spare moment over the last couple of months As a result I think that this reality is starting to take over My emotional involvement in the lives of your characters is reaching an unhealthy depth and your brutality with them is breaking my motherfucking heart I just finished ASOS a moment ago and said motherfucking heart is beating some serious drum and bass I often do and recently have read books to

anybody but this book turned me into an emotional reck in the best and worse possible ways It gave me moments were I found myself jumping round like a child who actually did get a pony for christmas

help keep me sane in an increasingly infuriating world And partly because they are comfortable to me The literary equivalent of a security blanket But Ill be honest Im also reading them so I can postpone reading the final Pratchett novel that came out a little while ago It will be hard for me to read that knowing that afterwards there will be no more new Pratchett to read Ever This is the book that introduces Vimes perhaps my favorite Discworld character And thats saying something given the number of books in the series and the number of truly delightful characters That said on rereading this I was surprised to see where Vimes got his start The Vimes in this first book is a good character but its not the character I grew to love Its pretty obvious that Pratchett was planning on him being a Discworld version of the downonhisluck gumshoe detective Harddrinking and bitter More stubborn than cleverDont get me wrong Vimes is a good character in this book but hes not particularly noteworthy Carrot and the Patrician shine moreAs a writer its interesting for me to see how Pratchett started here with a functional but not stellar character who he then changed rather abruptly into one of my favorites in the whole series Its nice for me to see that Pratchett didnt have it all planned out ahead of time and that he was in fact just making it all up as he went along

of your life muttering about how overrated he is Terry Pratchett wrote these two books Then all of a sudden he started writing really really well I dont know what happened Maybe he sold his soul My own theory is that his longsuffering wife waited as patiently as she could for him to pull himself together as a writer and then after she proofread his second novel something in her snapped and she thwapped him in the head with the book in question Youre better than this damn it she shouted Now get in there and write something good And he did Start with the first book in one of the subseries The Discworld books all take place on the same planet but they involve different groups of peopleThe witches my favoritesThe Night Watch my alsofavoritesDeath granted hes not a group but he does have a familyThe wizardsOkay there are standalones like Small Gods And in a way all the Discworld books are standalones Except for the first two because the first one ends on a cliffhanger Like I said skip them until youve read some of the really good ones and then brace yourself and read them purely for continuity purposes I started with the rd book in the series Carpe Jugulum and was perfectly fine other than a tendency to preach the gospel of Discworld Is Flippin Amazing And You Have To Read These Books which Im trying to get under controlBut its a lot of fun to follow the threads To start for instance with Equal Rites which introduces you to both the witches and the wizards This isnt Hogwarts and those most definitely are not the same thing in Discworld Then you can go on to Wyrd Sisters and Witches Abroad and fall absolutely in love with Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg I fully intend to be Granny Weatherwax when I grow up right down to the goat farm and the ability to terrify people just by saying Good morning Watch this spaceOr you can start with Guards Guards and be introduced to the men of the Night Watch Just bear in mind that Im first in line if Captain Vimes becomes available so keep your inevitable crush on him to yourselfI posted approximately  updates while I reread this book all quotable quotes Thats not even all the bits I wanted to post but Goodreads has a strict wordcount limit on updates because Goodreads hates me knows how I getYou can get a perfectly good sense of whether or not youll enjoy Guards Guards by perusing said updates You will enjoy it if you already enjoy fantasy you will very likely enjoy it even if you dont generally enjoy fantasy because the humor characterization and dialogue are ridiculously goodHave a good time And remember  hands off Vimes Hes mine   What I love most about Pratchetts books is that under a thin layer of funny footnotespeppered punheavy parody lies the core of deep seriousness rooted in the quite sobering understanding of the shallow pettiness of human mundanity fueled by jealousy bile spite and closemindedness  In the end the only thing that makes it possible to wake up in the morning is just a slight deviation from this depressing state of affairs that leads to the understanding and a bit of dignity and doing whats right  even when thats not quite expected Because someone has to uphold whats right Because someone needs to swim against the current   This is one of my favorite Discworld books and one of the best starting points for the Discworld newbies It is the first book in the subcycle focusing on the City Watch of Ankh Morpork the Pearl of Cities on the Disc the book that really takes a look into the inner workings of this crowded dirty and despicable and yet lovably tenacious urban metropolis In Pratchetts tradition of deconstructing the tropes this one has its kings and tyrants and secret societies and dragons and maidens and heroes and heirs with birthmarks and magical swords as well as milliontoone chances  except that things tend to not work out as planned And all of it is woven into a neat tight plot that carries us through the dry humor and slapstick and sad seriousness to the unexpected depth as you allow the cogs and wheels of your brain turn contemplating Pratchetts intentions  I am a Sam Vimes girl through and through And this book is our introduction to our cynical antihero uncompromising grumpy and terrifyingly soberknurd knurd as in complete and utter opposite to drunk beyond simple sobriety AnkhMorpork copper with the unsettling tendency to ask uncomfortable questions when others would much rather he didnt This is the beginning of the Vimes we all know and love the evolution from the downinthegutter pessimistic drunk brung low by a woman the city itself that is to the equally pessimistic servant not of the King or the Patrician but the law a thorn in the side of so many notsouncorrupt but quite respectably upstanding Ankh citizens Reduced to almostnothingness by the corruption in the city spending his time in the gutter literally laughed at by everyone except his two colleagues  the thick but amiable Fred Colon and a disgrace to human race aka Nobby Nobbs  Vimes gets a bit of a wakeup call when the Watch gets its newest recruit Lance Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson a nottoobright but earnest  foot  inches dwarf hes adopted okay armed with a Book of Laws and Ordinances of AnkhMorpork and a decidedly nonmagical swordAnd when the city is facing danger Vimes bit by bit begins to think about it as HIS city After all    And once Vimes sets his singleminded nature to accomplish something occasionally aided by the Librarian who is a peanutloving orangutan and the imposing figure of Lady Sybil Ramkin who breeds swamp dragons in her spare time there is little that can stop him The threat to AnkhMorpork is real and quite substantial view spoiler but ultimately its brought along and fueled by the simple human greed shallowmindedness and jealousy little pathetic mundanity of human existence that Pratchett so nonchalantly and nonpreachily lets showcase itself He it seems has an excellent ability of seeing the lessthanpleasant things that make people tick  and still manages to make these sad realizations both sidesplittingly and laughthroughtears funny And I adore that  Another prominent figure in this book in addition to Vimes and Carrot is of course Lord Havelock Vetinari the enigmatic Patrician the tyrant who is not quite well tyrannical the man with his finger on the pulse of the city the man who would not build a dungeon out of which he could not escape the man resembling a predatory flamingo who makes Ankh Morpork work and in cynicism can greatly rival Vimes himself This is the beginning of the fascinating and not always so voluntary cooperation between Vimes and the one in power and its lovely to read about  And of course some place of prominence is given to the Librarian the aforementioned orangutan who no pun intended will go bananas if you dare to call him the mword view spoilerMonkey  The Librarian who knows how to navigate the Lspace that parallel dimension that exists between every library in the world created because of terrifying power of books  I highly recommend this book to anyone as a perfect starting point on their Discworld journey It is a perfect introduction to the world of intelligent humor peppered with allusions to almost everything you can think of and smart conclusions that make you think and even ask the uncomfortable questions of yourself and the society It is a lovely way to spend several hours curled up in a chair on a rainy day mesmerized by Pratchetts wit and wisdom The audiobook version of it is wonderful immersing you in the atmosphere of the story incredibly well For all of it I give it  stars  and without much further ado embark on the rest on my Ankh Morpork City Watch reread  brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   At the time of writing Terry Pratchett passed away about a week ago Beside making me sad the news also triggered a sudden urge to read a Discworld book which needed to be satisfied immediately I havent read any Terry Pratchett books for years I have always liked them but there are just so many books in the world and you know how it is one thing led to another and somehow they didnt lead back to Sir Terry In the meantime I have been reading many inferior flavor of the month books like The Martian I have been doing myself a disservice reallyGuards Guards is one of the most popular Discworld books and I have not read it this makes it the ideal candidate for a reentry into this unique and wonderful series Anyway it is nice to be back in AnkhMorpork the most chaotic city in fantasy fiction At the most basic level Guards Guards is Pratchetts take on the police procedural but his imagination is too immense to constrain the book to just a single genre parody so there is much more to this book than just the City Watch AnkhMorporks feeble excuse for a police force The Watch mean are happily doing a crappy job which basically involve ringing bells at certain times of the night to announce that all is well in the city It takes the arrival of an extremely honest and straightlaced human orphan raised by dwarves to remind the Watchmen what they are supposed to be and a huge dragon summoned from another dimension burning up the citizens and half the city to spur them into actionOne reason I only read Terry Pratchett occasionally is that I personally prefer books where humour is a minor element of the story rather than placed at the front and centre After reading Guards Guards I have to admit this is my misconception of what Pratchett was doing with the Discworld series after the first few straightforward fantasy parody books The humour takes centre stage but underneath  not even far underneath  Pratchett was using Discworld as a mirror to explore lampoon and critique our world with its many ills and injustice Certainly Guards Guards explores the theme of the policemens duty and honor against personal safety and interest what makes a good cop and a bad cop so to speak He also skewers the masses tendency to blindly accept whoever has the biggest gun or fire breathing talent These and other serious issues are explored without ever missing a humorous beat The book is a laugh fest from beginning to end I dont think there is a single page that did not make me at least chuckleI actually laughed out loud several times my favorite joke involves the phrase Bjorn Stronginthearm is my uncle which highlights the bizarreness of the British phrase Bobs your uncle Also the patricians questioning of dragons penchant for sleeping on a huge pile of gold instead of a comfy mattress is brilliant Dont worry I have not spoiled the book for you I am barely scratching the surface of the many ingenious satires jokes and witticisms to be found in this bookThe characterization of the protagonists and antagonists is also very strong Captain Vimes is silly and funny yet flawed sympathetic honorable and extremely likable I am not surprised he one of Pratchetts most beloved characters The formidable Patrician Vetinari is another extremely vivid and lively creation in a TV adaptation of another Discworld book he is perfectly portrayed by Charles Dance so you can imagine the dry wit and suavity of the man His method of escaping from captivity in a dungeon is pure evil geniusGuards Guards is effortlessly a fivestar book and if I may leave you with a quote from this book that works perfectly even out of contextThe reason that clichs become clichs is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communicationThe irony is that there is not one clich in this book unless you count the ones that Pratchett turned on their headsRIP Sir Terry you were the bestCredit celticwren   First of all my site has the videos that go with this httpsclsiewertwordpresscomBut heres the lite versionMy Terry Pratchett Experience  is remarkably similar to my Month Python Experience Fun and funny but really best done in small doses Say  minute doses if Im watching longer if Im reading It turns out I havent read GuardsGuards before although I thought I had Quite possibly it is because I had not Quite possibly its because I had and forgot but youd think Id remember the dragons For future reference its the one where the adopted dwarf Carrot goes to the big city of AnkhMorpork and joins the Night Watch in hopes of Becoming a Man Night Watch captain Sam Vines spends most of his days and nights in an alcoholic stupor but the antics of Carrot in Enforcing Law and Order soon force Vines into involvement Meanwhile a secret society the Elucidated Bethren of the Ebon Night has decided to summon a dragon intending on overthrowing the Patrician Lord Vetinari and replacing him with an oldfashioned monarchy Some of the Brothers are quite sure they are being held down and need a monarchy to make things rightLike Monty Python Pratchett specializes in absurdity in mocking our perceptions definitions and expectation Clever and funny a little bit of social commentary with an edge both are particularly skilled in word gamesWhich puts me in mind of another famous sketch based on you know meaning and suchI wish to complain about this parrot I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutiqueWhats wrong with itIts deadNo no its restingIt is funny but when its all clever wordplaymocking villains in their thick dark cowls and the general populace for being sheep and Carrot for being So Earnest and Lady Sybil for being such a hearty large Englishwoman and the only one who is really clever is the Patricianwell its a bit hard to empathize And honestly rather tiringThen theres the Librarian an orangutan who runs the greatest library in the world Hes trying to make Constable Carrot understand a serious crime has been committedWhich pretty much reminds me of the Albatross sketch Both use the device of the straight man for maximum sillinessThe Albatross at IntermissionAt the end of the day certainly fun Theres certainly messages and social commentary that elevate it above simple romps but it tends to be applied with heavy emphasis Like Python best enjoyed in short sketches Dont worry Ill show myself outOn the way to the Ministry of Silly Walks   "},
{"title": "Mort",
"isbn": "0061020680",
"author": "Terry Pratchett",
"text": "Terry Pratchetts profoundly irreverent novels are consistent number one bestseller in England where they have catapulted him into the highest echelons of parody next to Mark Twain Kurt Vonnegut Douglas Adams and Carl HiaasenIn this Discworld installment Death comes to Mort with an offer he cant refuse  especially since being well dead isnt compulsory As Deaths apprentice hell have free board and lodging use of the company horse and he wont need time off for family funerals The position is everything Mort thought hed ever wanted until he discovers that this perfect job can be a killer on his love life I have a new best friend Literarily speakingIts as though I met Terry Pratchett at a party and we hit it off immediately You like Monty Python I LOVE Monty Python Seinfeld WHAT Ive seen them all Art Vandelay nice to meet you No way What about The Big Lebowsky Hows the smut business Jackie To which he replied I wouldnt know DudeHaAnd so it is with me reading my first Discworld novel in this case Mort  on the list Discworld is Terry Pratchetts hilarious fantasy universe which is medieval flat balanced on the backs of four great elephants and all riding on the back of a great cosmic turtle Each of the stories all share the same universal laws and truths have numerous recurring characters and all spring up Athena like from the head of great Zeus PratchettMort is an inquisitive gangly lad all elbows and knees who becomes the apprentice to Death Written a few years after On a Pale Horse the similarity to Piers Anthonys work is recognizable but that is where the familiarity endsMort and presumably all of the Discworld books are told with wit and sterling British humor Two parts Douglas Adams and One part Monty Python but all fun this will most certainly NOT be my last Discworld novel   Sir Terry died a few days ago and we are all the lesser at having lost him but better at having known him at all I am fortunate that I have so many more of his books to read and enjoy   This isnt an easy review to write This has been my first encounter with the Discworld universe and the many writings of Terry Pratchett and voicing my opinion on it makes me feel like a blundering fool stumbling into a world that was meant for his younger and perhaps wiser self a world of which he has only caught a glimpse Lets start with kicking in an open door Boy uh sorry Mort is a very funny novel Death being a wonderfully serious topic becomes a great source of laughter and smiles in the hands of Sir Pratchett The book contains the kind of humour that shows the common sense of absurdity and showcases the authors very refreshing look on things I think for readers young and old this different and highly original perspective is something to be appreciated and praised Comments that follow below are in no way intended to put buts and maybe it would have been betters alongside this praise An author who is able to describe a voice by the amount of time it could keep milk fresh is above all that He knew what he was doing and he did it extremely wellThat said I dont think Ill be returning to the Discworld universe very soon It felt as much too light a read I intentionally picked the Discworld novel with the Deaththeme not because Im a dark character but because I was half expecting some philosophical wisdoms holed up here and there I guess there were some but not as much as I had expected Theres not half a page that takes itself seriously sometimes to such an extent that I was wondering why I should continue reading it The plot is there but its rather thin so the jokes are what really drives this novel forward Its strange really Im all for jokes but I expect a bit more flesh in a book Id compare it to going to see a standup comedian specialized in oneliners First of all you need a bit of warming up as a member of the audience let go of a certain air of seriousness set your mind ready for a laughing spree and go with the flow I had the same need when reading this The lightness of the book initially annoyed me and it took me a couple of pages to just enjoy the humour of it Which I did But like with a standup comedy an hour or two is enough I had the same with this book resulting in short bouts of reading pleasure sandwiched between mild annoyance and mild boredom Apparently theres only so much I can take when it comes to footnotes representing a stream of consciousness plummeting into the absurd however pleasurable that plunge can be Id definitely recommend giving the Discworld Universe a try if you havent already but do it sooner rather than later I think a young readers mind will appreciate it much more even though theres something in there for all ages which Ill try to show in closing with my favorite quotes of the book    These quotes dont accurately show the humour of the book mind you Death may have no feelings no sense of justice and a rather grim visage but hes bound to make you laugh   I DONT KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I COULD MURDER A CURRYWith those simple words Terry Pratchett introduces the complicated fact that on The Disc Death is as much a person as anyone else only more soThe fourth Discworld novel is right up there with my favourites the story of how Death came to take an apprentice and how one gangly awkward young boy became a strong confident man is filled with humour and tells the kind of coming of age tale other authors only dream ofIt may not be the best written or contain the most interesting observations of humanity from the entire series but theres a real charm to this early Discworld novel that makes it hard to notice any of the faults in any depth Read for the first time in my early teens this is the book that is responsible for my love of the series and reading novels with more substance to them than John Grisham  Pratchett is still silly but here it is toned down with less cheap shots and more wit combined with characters not caricatures making for the first of the great books about The Disc The growth of Mort in to a man is handled very well and only needed pointing out one subtle time Then theres the romantic subplots the initially absurd Ysabel who evolves in to a driving force for the plot and of course Albert My experience of reading Albert this time was slightly surreal having seen the recent British TV movie adaptations and watching David Jason play both Rincewind in The Colour of Magic and Albert in Hogfather I managed to conjure up an amalgamation of both characters in my mind and then they share some scenes together at Unseen University  Of course this review wouldnt be complete without discussing Death a fan favourite as a background character in other Discworld books its fun to watch him stretch his legs a little witness Pratchett pushing the character in interesting and imaginative directions and without a shadow of a doubt the best conversations involve the grinning skeleton with the sparkle in his eyeIf youre wondering where to start with the incredibly large body of work that makes up the Discworld then this is the one I suggest if youre past your early teens   I made a mistake in my life by reading later works of Discworld DW first By the time I read earliest Discworld stories the universe feels not fully developed Mort is the fourth DW novel and I see the DW universe the jokes and the characters are better developed than the  earlier novels but still not as sophisticated as DW later works But there are some good moments the awkwardness of young people in this novel and the Deaths learning of lifePeople including Mort as the first in Death series and indeed Death has big role in this novel For a note Rincewind made an appearance in this novel    Un joven soador y bastante despistado Mortimer pero ms conocido como Mort pertenece a una familia de agricultores pero l no tiene ningn talento para ello Su padre y hermano deciden buscarle un oficio durante la feria de contratacin del Cerro de las Ovejas donde no ser hasta el ltimo momento en que su suerte cambie de lado y la figura cadavrica y encapuchada conocida como la Muerte le ofrezca ser su aprendiz Tras unas cuantas lecciones y unos cuantos errores ms la Muerte termina delegando parte de su trabajo en Mort dedicndose esta misma a reflexionar y buscar lo que es la diversin mientras Mort pone en serio riesgo el tejido de la realidadCuarta novela de la extensa saga de cuarenta y un volmenes que conforma Mundodisco y la primera que inicio la saga de la Muerte Como toda historia de Terry Pratchett al menos las tres anteriores que he ledo presenta una trama disparatada desbordando imaginacin por los cuatro costados y con un humor que hacen que sus historias sean de lo ms divertidas Me he encontrado con la hasta ahora mi mejor lectura dentro de esta saga parece que Pratchett encuentra el equilibrio narrativo y mayor cohesin no meras escenas o gags como me haban parecido en las tres anteriores Una historia que me ha resultado frentica e impredecible con un argumento sencillo pero que trata temas tan interesantes como la justicia el destino y obviamente la muerte dejndote citas para recordar y reflexiones de lo ms interesantes si uno agudiza sus sentidos con la lectura y recoge esos pensamientos incisivos que deja su comprensinSi has ledo a Pratchett con anterioridad sabrs que tiene un estilo muy fluido con una prosa bastante cuidada y que no existen captulos ni prlogos ni eplogos Otro de sus seas de identidad son las delirantes notas a pie de pgina siendo este el primer volumen donde ms he encontrado y donde por primera vez en mi vida he visto una nota al pie de pgina dentro de otra simplemente fantstico Otra de las cualidades que hay que destacar en cuanto a la edicin del texto es que la Muerte habla siempre en maysculas lo cual al menos en mi caso aporta una voz diferente y profunda durante la lectura a su personaje Es muy interesante como Pratchett va desarrollando su mundo en cada volumen aqu aprenderemos cosas como sabe la Muerte el momento en que van a morir las personas nos explicar el funcionamiento de la velocidad de la luz en el Disco nos contar alguna particularidad sobre los hechiceros o Dioses y un ciento de cosas ms Adems tendremos el cameo de un par de personajes de las dos anteriores novelas que aunque no supone nada para la trama siempre te sacan la sonrisilla y ese guio socarrn pensando que a ese personaje ya lo conoces   "},

"text": "Terry Pratchetts profoundly irreverent bestselling novels have garnered him a revered position in the halls of parody next to the likes of Mark Twain Kurt Vonnegut Douglas Adams and Carl HiaasenThe Color of Magic is Terry Pratchetts maiden voyage through the nowlegendary land of Discworld This is where it all begins  with the tourist Twoflower and his wizard guide RincewindOn a world supported on the back of a giant turtle sex unknown a gleeful explosive wickedly eccentric expedition sets out Theres an avaricious but inept wizard a naive tourist whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs dragons who only exist if you believe in them and of course THE EDGE of the planet I havent reviewed this because I read it so long ago that all I can remember is I loved itIll take our very old and battered copy bought in  to the hospice this weekend when I go with Celyn and see if I cant refresh my memoryRIP Sir TerryDONT THINK OF IT AS DYING said Death JUST THINK OF IT AS LEAVING EARLY TO AVOID THE RUSHSo  to the reviewIve just read this in slightly over  hours  which is extraordinary for me I normally take a month to read a book It is to be fair both a very readable and a very short book  words  a short fantasy these days is  wordsI was surprised to find how much of this I remembered especially as I last read it  years agoIts a very funny book with some GREAT oneliners I particularly liked one that said about men falling foul of the thieves guild I paraphrase  men who wouldnt be going home again  unless they happened to live near the river and their corpses floated by on the way to the seaAnd this from the character Twoflower was poignantWhen I think that I might die without seeing a hundredth of all there is to see it makes me feel he paused then added well humble I suppose And very angry of course Anyway  incompetent and cowardly failed wizard Rincewind falls in with Twoflower the naive tourist with an impossibly optimistic attitude oodles of gold and an indestructible vicious and implacable treasure chest on legs to defend himHilarity ensues as Twoflower tries to see everything Rincewind tries not to die and the gods play games with them We get a great tour of the Discworld its geography magics and inhabitants all of which are so fantastically imaginative and amusing that even geography becomes a joyThis isnt Terry Pratchetts best book but its full of all the great stuff that gathers together into its peak a few books into the series Its certainly an excellent book though Pratchett has an incredibly rare talent for compressing humour into oneliners that are witty incisive and yet never feel mean  its not jokes that you feel are directed at anyone just mined from the stuff of lifeI had a great time revisiting this book and if youve not tried it  nows the time   Reading The Color of Magic is akin to eating an entire bowl of ice cream just a little too fastsure it may cause your head to hurt at times but the sweet rewards make it all worth itFilled with ambitious wizards and ruthless assassins the city of AnkhMorpork has survived many dangers in the past but now it faces an even more destructive forceTOURISM When a rich but bored outsider named Twoflower decides to explore the city in search for adventure it soon becomes an adventure for everyone around him too Twoflowers wellmeaning but careless ways earn him the attention of pirates dragonriders and various supernatural entities all looking to rid Twoflower of his treasurenot to mention his life Soon failed wizard Rincewind reluctantly becomes Twoflowers guide and as Twoflower explores more and more of Discworld looking for the adventure of a lifetime Rincewind tries desperately to make sure his lifetime lasts for more than five minutesThis was me for about  of this bookAnnnnnd here I am for the other What I loved most about this book was definitely the humor Some authors can only come up with a great laughoutloud moment once or twice in a book but Pratchett is able to pull one off in just about every page There are oodles of witty dialogue all throughout the novel as well as some great slapstick moments In addition Pratchett gives us some excellent satire too I got a big kick out of how familiar some of Twoflowers ideas were like when he convinces a bar owner to place a bet on whether or not the bar will be damagedTwoflower calls this process innsewerants By having the other characters mock the outrageous concepts Twoflower introduces them to it did a magnificent job painting an amusing picture of some of the absurdities of everyday life The Color of Magic isnt just a humorous book it actually manages to pull off several different kinds of humorAlso I was amazed with the extent of Pratchetts imagination While some elements of this book are your standard fantasy archetypes Pratchett really ups the ante by giving us some brilliantly creative concepts as well With translucent dragons trolls made out of water a sentient piece of luggage that manages to display so much personality without ever saying a word and an upsidedown swordfight that has to be seen errr read to be believed Pratchett never runs out of new ideas to entertain his audience withAlas while I enjoyed this book very much I did have a couple of issues with it For one thing I felt like Pratchett tried to cram way too much into a book thats barely over  pages So many characters and creatures come and go it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of whats going on I have some friends who didnt enjoy the Game of Thrones book as they found it confusing but at least George RR Martin takes a good amount of time to establish all the characters whereas this book can sometimes feel like trying to watch a NASCAR race where all the cars are speeding in a different direction Also some of Pratchetts ideas were a little too outthere for meI knew this was going to be a problem right away when Pratchett begins the book by revealing that Discworld is a planet that is carried on the backs of four elephants who are all standing on the shell of a giant turtle that is floating through spaceThis is an awful lot to throw at me on page one Mr PratchettAlso while The Color of Magic works beautifully as a comedy Im afraid the actual story doesnt quite hit the mark The book is divided into four parts and each part feels like a separate book Almost anyone introduced in one section is absent in the other three so were left wondering what happened to many different characters While the events of Rincewinds and Twoflowers journey are fun to watch theres very little true progression or closure This storytelling technique was especially baffling in the fourth segment where Pratchett keeps referring to an adventure that we never got to see as it occurred inbetween the third and fourth sections This disjointed method of storytelling prevented the book from becoming anything more than just a comedy of errors as amusing as those errors may have beenSo while I felt this book would have been better if it were a bit longer and some of the concepts had been more fleshed out I still had a lot of fun reading this hysterically funny adventure Ive been told that the first couple of books in the Discworld series pale in comparison to the later ones Considering how entertaining The Color of Magic was if this truly is one of the weaker entries I cant wait to read more of the Discworld series    Before picking it up Id heard that The Colour of Magic was funny Now that can mean just about anything because lets face it comedy is the most subjective of arts Funny is a deeply personal thing The funny peculiar and the funny haha might not be the same from person to person or even to the same person depending on their mood or their place in life So knowing something is funny ahead of reading it really doesnt tell me much Id read Terry Pratchetts  Neil Gaimans Good Omens quite a while ago so I expected at least a hint of satire and politically conscious wit but I had no idea which of the authors to blame for the smart laughs in Good Omens and my recollections really shed no illumination on what was to come So I read The Colour of Magic with as open a mind as I could and hoped for some laughs I didnt laugh much and that surprised me I smiled an awful lot though But I didnt laugh No out loud snickers no fullout belly laughs no snorts no giggles But I did smile Pratchetts kooky tale really four tales to make one of Rincewind the onegreatspell wizarding failure Twoflower the insewerants adjustertourist and his Luggage was smart more often than it was stupid consciously political satirically silly more than willing to take the piss out of Fantasy as a genre but mostly it was exceedingly absurd And all of this was what made The Colour of Magic good to very good Even so its audience is necessarily limited I know why I liked The Colour of Magic and while I imagine there are other reasons to like the story I think it is probably a fairly inaccessible tale unless you are a reader who falls into a niche of accessibility This is not a book that can be widely read or widely liked So why did I like it I liked it because I fall into a niche wherein I was able to access memories of drunken drugaddled teenage DD marathons which were extremely rare since we preferred our gaming sober where we gave up being serious and descended into near madness Those nights are reflected in everything that happens in The Colour of Magic Obligatory bar fights of fantastic impossibility Monty Hall swords and treasures idiotic last second rescues gods dicing heroes thinking with the dirk in their pants dimensional slips and deus ex machinas at every turn make The Colour of Magic a collage of gaming stupidity and it was nice to take a nostalgic trip back to my adolescence In fact Pratchett captures exactly the sort of gaming experience that led our halfling priest of Xyice God of Mischief to wish for a foot long penis then fall unconscious from blood loss when he achieved his first erection So I liked this booka lot actuallyBut it wasnt the best story Ive ever read and I cant imagine I could sit down and read the entire Discworld cycle without a break Its fun Its light Pratchett writes better than I expected but I bet there are many folks out there who hate this book You have my sympathy So yesI was disappointed that I didnt laugh more I was disappointed that the story wasnt more subtle I hated the turtle carrying the disc I wanted The Colour of Magic to be more biting than silly more critical than absurd more intelligent than clever But it was a fun ride that entertained me while I did the dishes and I couldnt help liking Rincewind so I will probably go on and I will likely become a fan of Pratchetts Discworld booksin spite of themselves    Im pretty sure people have told me about Pratchett and his Diskworld series before usually working in the phrase Hes the Douglas Adams of fantasy into the description But the problem was that I always felt that I had had enough of Adams after the third Hithikers Guide to the Galaxy book and whenever I scanned Pratchetts section in the bookstore I was immediately put off by not knowing where to start reading among the approximately five hundred thousand Diskworld books Im glad I finally took the time to find out that these two books The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic jointly comprise the first tale in the series and that they were definitely worth readingThe Diskworld books are essentially satire of the high fantasy genre or at least thats the foundation upon which everything else is built This pair of books follows the misadventures of Rincewind a utterly inept and thoroughly cowardly wizard and Twoflowers a clueless traveler who happens to be in possession of both endless optimism and a magical suitcase thats always wandering off and messily devouring people who get in its way Things go from bad to worse for the two as divine powers both deliver them into and yank them out of all kinds of fantastic perilsAs someone who grew up reading plenty of this kind of thing and playing a lot of Dungeons Dragons Im familiar enough with the genre and trappings that Pratchett lampoons Yes theres the Conan parody theres the Dragonriders of Pern tribute theres the injoke about Leibers Fafhrd and Gray Mouser But thats easy The thing that made me almost immediately fall in love with these books is the authors dry wit and his ability to derive humor not only from the absurdity of the story and believe me it gets plenty absurd but also from just good old fashioned turns of phrase wry commentary and jokes The guy just has an amazing ability to stuff five or six jokes into a single sentence most of them making masterful use of that trusty standby of British humor irony Its really smart and really funny and the fact that it builds on the inherent silliness of the high fantasy genre is just icingI should also note how imaginative Pratchett is which is a useful quality given his subject matter He bounces his heroes from one generally horrible and dangerous situation to another at a frantic pace and his ability to come up with new material and new situations amazes me And while many of them are obvious parodies of fantasy staples just as many seem to be wholly new creations As one small and obligatory example the Diskworld itself is a flat coin of a world that rides atop four enormous elephants who themselves ride on the back of a colossal turtle with two continentsized flippers that it uses to swim slowly through the cold reaches of spaceBut at the same time if I have one complaint about these first two books its that theyre almost maniacal in their plotting While its nice to see Pratchetts considerable imagination and humor on display as we go from situation to situation the first book reads like an extended doodle with little plot and a whole gods playing games with mortals subtext thats entirely dropped in the next book Theres also one Conan the Barbarian parody thats abruptly dropped in favor of another Conan the Barbarian parody who Pratchett apparently liked better Its not until the latter part of the second book does an overall plot come into play but honestly I was enjoying myself so much I really didnt mind Expect to see lots more Discworld books reviewed here in the future    Tried to start him at the beginning as many of my dear friends love him However this book showed no particular charm nor skill of construction It is an early piece so this unpractised work is to be expected The jokes were more worthy of groans than guffaws and I was left feeling rather let down since hes been compared to the superlatively funny Douglas AdamsAfter finding this one dull a friend suggested I try one of his later books so I started Moving Pictures which was better crafted but no more amusing I guess you cant trust your

"text": "According to   So the armies of Good and Evil are amassing Atlantis is rising frogs are falling tempers are flaring Everything appears to be going according to Divine Plan Except a somewhat fussy angel and a fastliving demonboth of whom have lived amongst Earths mortals since The Beginning and have grown rather fond of the lifestyleare not actually looking forward to the coming Rapture  And someone seems to have misplaced the Antichrist    Remember back when funny books were funny Back before you went to college and found out that Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen werent funny after all but Samuel Beckett and Charles Dickens were hilarious Remember when the words on the page didnt just make you smile wryly and shake your head in shame for humanity but actually made you laugh out loud Well thats the kind of humor that Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaimans  release Good Omens brims with and it is so damn goodThe two British authors were both relatively unknown at the time of their partnership having met when Gaiman working as a journalist at the time interviewed Pratchett on the success of his first major novel The Colour of Magic The two became quick friends and proceeded to write the  pages of the now cult classic novel by sending floppy disks through the mail and calling each other on the phone Of course that story is all explained in the appendix provided you dont pick up an original printing of the book if you do do that however you can probably sell it for quite a bit of change so dont be discouraged by your lack of author interviewsBut the real story at hand is of course the narrative of Good Omens itselfthe tale of two friends a demon named Crowley and an angel named Aziraphale who have spent all of human existence on earth and have rather come to like it so when it comes time for the Apocalypse they try to do whatever is in their powers to stop it The cast of costars can only described as vast with some characters only popping in long enough for Aziraphale to take over their body or to go on a shooting rampage The main other characters though include the Antichrist himself a young boy named Adam and his gang of friends a witchfinder named Newton Pulsifer and his love interest Anathema Device who just happens to be a witch and one whose ancestor Agnes Nutter was burned at the stake by Newtons greatgreatetc grandfather ThouShaltNotCommitAdultery PulsiferPerhaps youre beginning to pick up on that sense of humor I mentionedThats what makes this book so great Im sort of a sucker for religious humor and religious horror movies and Ive read a lot of books about the End Days This one has to rank near the top maybe even as the downright finest Its humor ranges from simple little comedic bits to social commentary on religion and the human racebut no matter how big or small the joke is every one of them is attended to equally and they are all funny because of that Though some of the British jokes and references flew by me a problem the authors usually account for in their humorous footnotes I really did enjoy this book all the way from the plot down to how it was written It really is an impressive feat for a coauthored book to feel so seemless this honestly almost puts shame to the excellent Stephen KingPeter Straub doubleups The Talisman and Black HouseSo let down your guard pack away that condescension that your professors poured into you Lit class after Lit class and resist the urge to turn up your nose at any novel you can buy in trade paperback form in airports for  but higher in Canadaoh wait not anymore I actually laughed out loud as I read Good Omens A few times to be completely honest And thats pretty impressive for a cynical jaded old bastard like me   I somehow ended up reading them both simultaneously So I couldnt help wonderingWhat Madam Bovary Might Have Thought Of Three days later a package arrived there was no return address but she immediately recognised Rodolphes hand It contained a paperback novel whose title was Good Omens Feverishly she cast herself over it Her English was poor but with the aid of a dictionary she persevered and soon made great progressThe more she read the greater her bewilderment became The book at first reminded her of Candide which she had surreptitiously read at the convent but M Voltaires sprit had been replaced by another ingredient she was unable to name she suspected that it must be the strange English invention they called humour All the personages were wellmeaning and agreeable the witches the torturers of witches the prostitutes even the Demons of Hell they were filled with kindness and compassion and their worst faults amounted to an occasional mild irritability Where were the indifference and thoughtless cruelty that surrounded her and which had now become the very air she breathed She did not know whether Rodolphe had sent her the book to comfort her or to mock her in her despair and her futile attempts to resolve this question gradually resulted in an agonising headache Her husband prescribed an infusion of valerian and persuaded her to retire for the night she lay sleepless in her bed a long time until the drug finally took effect just as the sky was beginning to lighten She dreamed of apocalyptic prophecies redheaded women wielding swords endless circles of horseless carriages young boys with dogsIn the morning she remembered that she should purchase some arsenicIt seemed unfair for this to be oneway So in the spirit of granting a right of reply heres What Good Omens Might Have Thought Of Madam BovaryI saw this smashin film yesterday on TV said Adam as the Them listened attentively It was called Madam BovverBoy She was a lady skinhead interrupted BrianNo stupid said Adam Its a French name BovverBoy By FlowBearYou mean Madame Bovary by Flaubert said Wensleydale I read about it in The Encyclopaedia of World LiteratureAdam gave him a withering glance Thats what I said he continued Madam BovverBoy by FlowBear Shes married to this doctor and hes dead borin so she starts hangin around with these two lovers and then she maxes out her credit card so she eats arsernick and poisons herself The bit where shes dyin of the arsernick is dead good Her tongues hanging out and shes screamin Why did she max out her credit card asked PepperShe was buying presents for her lovers said Adam Roses an boxes of chocolates an stuff like that I thought the lovers were supposed to give her presents said Brian dubiously My sisters boyfriend gave her this huge bunch of roses on Valentines Day and a box of Quality Street and a balloon with She gave them presents instead because it was a protofeminist novel explained Wensleydale authoritatively Thats what The Encyclopaedia of World Literature saysAdam felt that his control of the situation was slipping and decided to up the stakes Its all true he said in an exegetical move that would have had Flaubert scholars around the world clutching their foreheads Based on a true story he added prudently in case the The Encyclopaedia of World Literature happened to have opinions on the subject Behind the bushes Aziraphale raised an eyebrow Crowley looked defensive Very loosely based he whispered hastily I mean I tempted her its my job you know but Gustave changed the ending for dramatic purposes Said it didnt work to have Rodolphe sort out her debts and then settle down in a cozy mnage  quatre with her Lon and her husband I told him thats what actually happened but he insisted the arsenic worked better   In my personal hierarchy of books this one comes a close second after Bulgakovs The Master and Margarita What can I say  like diabolical father like infernal son In a way I can view this book as my own personal therapy session  that is in addition to it being a hilarious dryhumor take on Armageddon and the everdual nature of humanity its highs and lows and our ability to be both frequently almost at the same time As a kid I had a habit of getting into the books clearly not meant for my age  like for instance WARNING THERE WILL BE MILD SPOILERS BECAUSE I CANAs predicted by the titular th century witch Agnes Nutter in her extremely nice accurate book of prophecies handed down through centuries to her last living professional descendant Anathema Device Armageddon is quickly approaching The four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse have set out on their way and that must mean things are getting serious   And this upcoming major event is a source of some serious worry for eternalenemiesturnedreluctantfriends Aziraphale An angel and a parttime rare book dealer and Crowley An Angel who did not so much Fall as Saunter Vaguely Downwards the duo who after six thousand years have gone native and would infinitely prefer this world to the future where either side wins  the future oh the horror without good music or bookshops or sushi restaurants And so the unlikely allies decide to band together to prevent the end of the world Except things do not go as plannedThe lovely images above can be seen here and hereYou see the young  Aptly named Adam he grows up  as his name suggests  perfectly human in a little corner of paradise  the English village of Lower Tadfield But Agnes Nutter is never wrong and as her prophesies suggest shortly after Adams eleventh birthday on which he DOES get a much wanted Hellhound Dog the events of the end of the world are set in their inevitable ineffable motion But Adams essential humanity puts a new spin on this old storyThe problem with the Antichrist Adam is that he a human elevenyearold boy is fueled  unexpectedly  by Love and righteous indignation He loves this world and he coming into his power wants a very human thing  he wants to make it better Dont we all But do and can his good intentions make any difference in the way things have been prophesied to goIf there is one thing this book gets through its the belief in humanity Not in its wickedness or goodness or anything like that Just humanity in all the multifaceted nature of it in its righteousness and wretchedness love and cruelty strengths and weaknesses stupidity and wisdom Sometimes maybe when left to our own devices when not preached to in one way or another we can perhaps develop into flawed but hopefully decent beings  like Adam named after the first human in the prophetic fashion after all Because what makes life interesting as a particular angel and demon would loudly attest to is precisely the combination of good and evil nice and nasty mean and kind that we all possess in the precarious and miraculous balance that is the true treasure of humanity Because it makes us act like peopleAnd maybe just maybe due to our alwaysbalancing nature on the borderline between two conflicting universes that we humans inhabit we will be able to eventually figure it out  without anyone messing with our heads filling them with the Good or the Evil endlessly preaching what they believe to be true  but simple letting us be ourselves Maybe we will figure things out on our ownThe brilliant PratchettGaiman duo provides everything these two authors are famous for  easy readability dry intelligent sarcasminfused humor seamless plot that pushes the limits of imagination while staying perfectly grounded in albeit fantastical reality and first and foremost very apt observations about human nature as well as in a true Pratchettlike way a complete irreverence for the setinstone beliefs and ideas At times its easy for those familiar with their respective styles to tell which one of them penned which part at times its impossible  but it doesnt matter as their writing styles blend together so well so seamlessly so seemingly effortlesslyThis is an excellent book  both funny and serious at times utterly unpredictable at times baffling at times logical Its a pleasure to read and a pleasure to seriously reflect upon after having a good laugh And for all of that it gets the ineffable five stars  June  I just listened to this one on audiobook  AGAIN I love it more and more with each time I do I have to advise  if you plan to listen to this one please get the British version with Stephen Briggs as the narrator Isis Publishing  it is lightyears better than Harper Audio Stephen Briggs is amazing   Overall this book was a huge disappointment for me Id heard so many good things about it and had been meaning to read it for years When I finally started it I was about  pages into it and thought Yes This is going to be one of the most entertaining books Ive ever read It was like reading The Hitchhikers Guide for the first time again It was witty and fastpaced and had so many brilliant things to say about society and religion And then about halfway through I realized that I just wasnt really laughing as much anymore The story seemed to get bogged down with characters that werent that interesting for me to read about and who I often found a bit annoying Most notably the yearold Antichrist and his friends seemed really out of place in the book They felt like they would have been at home in a Norman Rockwell painting or British equivalenta ragtag bunch of kids with slingshots and backyard adventures I think that I was supposed to find them and their inane conversations entertaining maybe even a little bit cute but every time they came around which felt like quite a bit I thought that the book just screeched to a haltMost of the other characters in the book were great fun to readthe demon and the angel and their strange sort of friendship was easily the best part of the book for me The four horsemen of the apocalypse were also a lot of fun at least most of the time Overall the premise was brilliant What a disappointment for me that it just couldnt keep it together throughout The ending seemed contrived and the resolution was just unsatisfying for me I know that so many people loved this book I wish that I could have enjoyed it as much as they did    This has got to be one of the funniest satires Ive ever read I suppose the closest comparison I could make is to describe it as a literary sibling to Dogma but filtered through a distinctly British lense That description doesnt really do the story justice but that film definitely hits me in the same place as the book The whole premise and Im not giving much away here begins with the accidental misplacement of the infant Antichrist during a complex babyswapping procedure intended to kick off the Apocalypse Its all down hill from there  This book is funny irreverent and at times surprisingly insightful While some parts of the book may seem cliched or even kitschy the book never puts up the pretense of being revolutionary or edgy The characters like any melodrama are intended to be archetypal so even the relatively predictable changes that occur seem appropriate in the context of the story The surprises are really in the details and in that regard the execution is brilliant To give you an example the devil Crowly drives a car in which the tapedeck will transform any tape placed in it into a copy of Queens Greatest Hits within a very short period of time after one hits the play button Now I love Bohemian Rhapsody as much as the next guy but an eternity of nothing but THAT particular album Thats the kind of devilry that works on many levels   "},

"text": "Susan had never hung up a stocking  Shed never put a tooth under her pillow in the serious expectation that a dentally inclined fairy would turn up It wasnt that her parents didnt believe in such things They didnt need to believe in them They know they existed They just wished they didntThere are those who believe and those who dont Through the ages superstition has had its uses Nowhere more so than in the Discworld where its helped to maintain the status quo Anything that undermines superstition has to be viewed with some caution There may be consequences particularly on the last night of the year when the time is turning When those consequences turn out to be the end of the world you need to be prepared You might even want more standing between you and oblivion than a mere slip of a girl  even if she has looked Death in the face on numerous occasions This is a book about the nature of belief the reminder that things we think of as essential eternal unbreakable are here because we willed them to be It is the book about origins of sortsThis book is a reminder that what we think of as sweet harmless stories come from darker scary places And that is for a reason So many things stem from the simple fact  we humans need to believe we need to create and fantasize to make the world make any sense to have the world we think of as permanent BEBelief is what underlies what we are as humans But Pratchett in this Christmastype Discworld story does not harp on the same old You gotta believe because of the holiday spirit BS He does not limit himself to the cynical in its childhood clarity belief that if you dont believe in Santa there will be no presents No in his interpretation belief is our attempt to make things make sense Yes we chose to believe in gods or in nature or karma or things of that sort we take comfort in these things But belief Pratchett is concerned with is way more than that  it is whats woven into the fabric of our existence without it would we ever even have abstract concepts that define us  mercy justice compassion friendship love Basically we need to believe in little lies  like Hogfather  before we are able to believe in big lies that make us humanAnd thats what Pratchett says in this book through the smallcaps voice of his most enigmatic and inhuman character  DEATH Why Because some things are fairly obvious when its a sevenfoot skeleton with a scythe telling you them  Despite what I wrote above this story with all the thinkaboutit message is far from preaching on the contrary its hilariously entertaining Due to a bit of trouble involving the Auditors of Reality and a sociopathic member of the Assassins Guild Mister Teatime who saw things differently from other people and one of the ways that he saw things differently from other people was in seeing other people as things Death finds himself in need to impersonate the legendary Hogfather think Santa Claus with boar husks riding a sleigh led by boars And there are teeth involvedAnd ultimately its up to Deaths granddaughter dont ask Susan to fix this entire mess Susan the levelheaded extrarational selfsufficient duchessturnedgoverness who firmly believes that Real children do not go hoppity skip unless they are on drugs Susan the levelheaded young woman that despite trying to cling to normality keeps monsters in line with a very important storylinewise fireplace poker  And it is exactly this combination of magic and firm reality that makes her such an irresistible character That and the extreme pragmaticism combined with a weary knowledge of the world that does not fit into the rigid frames of everyday normal  And of course we get to enjoy the company of one of Pratchetts most fascinating characters  Death There are plenty of funny moments as he tries on Hogfathers false beard for size so to say Up until now he never had to trouble himself with the naughty or nice question and hes never had people line up eager to see him And there are a few things that Death learns thanks to this new temporary jobs  like the value of charity the gift of life if youve ever been scarred by Andersens saddest fairytale A Girl with Matches youll know right away what I mean and the unfairness of socioeconomic status quo  Not to mention the pointyhatted appearance of the Wizards of the Unseen University Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every time the amazing thinking machine Hex which from now on will be FTBenabled view spoilerFTB  fluffy teddy bear of course  Verucca Gnome Nobby Nobbs who of course had been a nice ummm individual and one wellcrafted bathroom All together all this creates Pratchetts trademark witty and slightly absurd atmosphere frequently with seriousness cleverly hiding behind wellplaced puns and goofs stars and a high recommendation to new and old Pratchett fans This one will definitely remains my beloved annual holiday readbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   First read th June   starsSecond read th December   stars You can read my full review of Terry Pratchetts th Discworld novel is their version of a Yuletide story complete with many deaths lots of Death and some of the most thoughtprovoking conversations Ive ever come across The humour is typical earlyDiscworld It can be subtle or it can be in your faceWhat you take from this particular novel however is just how important belief is to Human Beings If we did not believe what would we be   This book is hilariousThe Auditors have decided that they need to remove the Hog Fatherso they contact the Assassins guild and Mr Teatime pronounce it Tehahtimeh  is sent to inhum him but Hog Father isnt human As you can imagine chaos ensues With Death taking over the Hog Fathers role to keep belief in him alive while Mr Teatime pronounce it Tehahtimeh and Susan Deaths grand daughter are in the realm of the tooth fairyTeatime trying to use whats there to assassinate the Hog Father and Susan trying to stop him while Death is taking childrens Hog Watch wishes very literally While all this is going on we havent even talked about the wizards andwell you get the ideaPratchett at his best and thats saying something Read this or the Verruca Gnome might show up think about it   As usual plenty of humour with an edge I did occasionally wonder where and how all the plot threads were going to meet up and how they were connected Im not sure the Auditors were strictly necessary to the plot but maybe they figure elsewhere in Discworld novels I havent read yet I enjoyed the hijinks at Unseen University more than I expected to The daft old wizards were funnier than Id seen them be before underling wizard Ponder and the thinking machine Hex are charming The sendup of Christmas commercialism and the Santa idea is fantastic This is the first Discworld novel Ive read in which Death plays a major part and I really like how he attempts to understand people and revive belief in the Hogfather His attempts to improve upon customs are great especially the sequence at the Hogswatch Grotto in the Maul and his attempts to fairly redistribute wealth Because I work for a nonprofit agency that gets swamped with donations in November and December and struggles to meet needs in June the commentary about a lot of peoples true motivations for holiday giving really hit the mark Deaths granddaughter Susan is an excellent character another of Pratchetts very cool females and I really enjoyed her parts of the plot too whether shes dealing with the monsters under the bed or trying to figure out why Deaths flying around going HO HO HO Im continuously amazed how Pratchett manages to point out the absurdities of the human condition while still being such a humanist and championing the power of imagination    It could be the festive cheer finally working its way into my bones it could be the snow on the ground adding to the overall feel of this Christmas season it might even have been watching Bruce Willis yell Yippee KiYay Mother Fucker at some Europeans in a building But there was something about this book which captured my imagination and put it atop the list of best Discworld novels I have read to dateI dont think there was anything really stand out in this one compared to the others I have read each novel has a set theme and it is told with satirical wit echoing our world This time out it was Father Christmas turn and the whole Christmas feeling There are plenty of interesting characters but Death does have a more prevalent role and he entertains throughout trying to get his head around the whole idea of Christmas and the giving of gifts Death and Albert steal the show in this one for me but there were no real dull characters and all were entertaining to read about but as seems to be the norm for me the Wizards were the least entertainingWell worth a read but I am definitely glad I bumped this one up my reading list to fit in with the season as it may not have had the same impact out of season HO HO HOIf you like this try Going Postal by Terry Practhett   "},

they set off across the Enchanted Forest to tackle the dragonnapping and save the King of the Dragons Patricia C Wrede has been one of my favorite authors for her witty original use of common fantasy themes This is the nd book of her  book series and is one of my favorites This book is a great read for all ages with laugh out loud humor Violence mild grated violence with melting wizards and fighting rocksnakesLanguage Mendenbar takes the Lords name in vain about  times but that is all the rest is he cursed under his breath etcSexual themes Grated pressure for Mendenbar to get married and innocent attraction between him and someone else Age recommendation All ages Any age old enough to understand and enjoy it   Lord I love these books so much Searching for Dragons follows the adventures of Cimorene but is told from the point of view of Mendanbar the King of the Enchanted Forest Mendanbar is as unconventional as Cimorene and just as subject to being nagged about the proper way to do things The change of perspective is nice and also enables the reader to see exactly how charming Cimorene is from the outsideOne of the things I appreciate about Wrede is the fact that while her characters bemoan the silliness of princesses they cast aspersions on the silliness of princes just as often Additionally Wrede makes sure to throw in some allusions to the social circumstances that make princesses act silly Silly princesses are a common trope but books that give comparable time to silly princes and discuss the impact of societal expectations on the way women act are rare Honestly especially considering the fact that these are childrens books Wrede does an excellent job with delving into social constructs of gender My favourite witch Morwen also makes an appearance in this book along with her horde of cats Seriously one day I hope to become Morwen She is fantastic Ballimore and Dobbilan the giants are completely charming bickering domestically about the necessity of grinding to bones of Englishmen into bread The cast of characters in this book is larger than in Dealing with Dragons but each new character is completely captivating in his or her own right No one seems superfluous or out of placeRating  DragonsFavourite Quote Erm really Favourite Scene for this one Sorry Just inside the door the giant stopped and sniffed the air Then he sneezed once scowled ferociously and said in a voice that shook the torches in their bracketsFee fie foe fumBallimore shook her head Nonsense dear Its just Princess Cimorene and the King of the Enchanted ForestAnd neither of us is English Cimorene addedThe giant squinted down at her Are you sure about thatPositive Mendanbar saidWell the giant sniffed again experimentally then lowered his club with a sigh Thats all right then I wasnt in the mood for more work tonight anyway Sorry about the mistake It must be this cold in my headRecommend Yes of course I dont think it even needs to be said at this point   Searching for Dragons introduces a new character Mendenbar who is the king of the Enchanted Forest Mendenbar stumbles across burnt spots in his forest and a bunch of dragon scales in the area On the way to figuring out the story behind everything he meets Morwen and Cimorene This installment had Cimorene taking a back seat so we didnt get to see much of her witty and clever side which was a shame Mendenbar was definitely the main character in this one I didnt find him all that likeable but he had a lot to discover about his kingdom and magic and he expanded the plot outside Kazuls cave which I guess is a plus The book continues to break stereotypes who said a magic carpet ride had to be glamorous and quite a few buckets of soapy lemon water make appearances in this fun sequel to Dealing with Dragons   After loving Dealing with Dragons for so long I was really disappointed with myself for not finishing the series I decided to remedy the situation Unfortunately I was not NEARLY as pleased with the nd book in the series as I was the st Searching for Dragons is a followup of Cimorene and the Dragon King Kazul However Kazul has been missing for days and no one has any leads Suspecting the ever sneaky wizards Cimorene decides to take matters into her own hands and find Kazul However she is met with more than she expects when Mendenbar the King of the Enchanted Forest shows up on her doorstep to help The story follows their adventure as they search for Kazul and encounter helpful and unhelpful characters along the wayHeres the problem Its boring Theres none of the humor or silliness of the first book The st book was so unique and intriguing while this is just well there And also Mendenbar is badly written He is introduced at the very beginning of the book but I thought he was a jerk the whole time It wasnt until  or  chapters in did I realize hes the hero of the story and were supposed to be a fan of his DohIll keep reading the series just to see how it all ends and if it gets better And Ill even read these stories to my kids But this no where touches the original   October  July  Sometimes a king just wants to walk away from all the tedious business of running a country especially if hes the only one doing all the tedious work of running the country Even more so if he has an officious steward looking reproachfully at him all the time because he wont do things the proper way Fortunately theres a sort of crisis developing involving those nasty wizards and small areas of ecologic devastation to the Enchanted Forest so Mendenbar can go walk about and see whats up The plot thickens when he runs into Cimorene Chief cook and Librarian to Kazul King of the DragonsAfter a number of small scale and not very dangerous adventures among storybook characters with an embarrassing magic carpet everyone makes it home for a good mealStill a pleasure but with less of Cimorene being clever and more of her fencing prowess Youll cheer the vanquishing of those bothersome wizards without feeling guilty because they arent injured only inconvenienced for a while and theres no gore at allA good story to read to quite young children mine were six and three and a charming diversion for the more agedPersonal copy   "},

"text": "Here lives an orphaned ward named Lyra Belacqua whose carefree life among the scholars at Oxfords Jordan College is shattered by the arrival of two powerful visitors First her fearsome uncle Lord Asriel appears with evidence of mystery and danger in the far North including photographs of a mysterious celestial phenomenon called Dust and the dim outline of a city suspended in the Aurora Borealis that he suspects is part of an alternate universe He leaves Lyra in the care of Mrs Coulter an enigmatic scholar and explorer who offers to give Lyra the attention her uncle has long refused her In this multilayered narrative however nothing is as it seems Lyra sets out for the top of the world in search of her kidnapped playmate Roger bearing a rare truthtelling instrument the alethiometer All around her children are disappearingvictims of socalled Gobblersand being used as subjects in terrible experiments that separate humans from their daemons creatures that reflect each persons inner being And somehow both Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter are involved the golden compass trilogy seems like a natural progression in christian literature yes it is christian literature the same way the chronicles of narnia are aslan is only a lion when the reader is about  or so in the united states after a point he unrepentantly becomes jesus and the four children are like the gospels or something and the story is somewhat ruined then because as an adult you cant just shoehorn jesus into a lion outfit without snickering a littlepullman however has solved this problem i cant continue without utterly spoiling the story for everyone who hasnt read it so consider yourselves warnedhe made jesus into a little girl even better he made jesus into a little girl who doesnt even know shes jesus now hows that for a new twist on the new testament the part thats particularly brilliant about it is that it actually worked lyra is never really anything like christ she just follows the path of his narrative first she has the absent father lord asrael is desperately involved in his own ideas so though hes not actually in heaven he may as well be wait a sec isnt this just dogma again sort of except dogma is really more relevant to catholicism in particular rather than scriptures and instead of linda fiorentino who is kind of a mopey christ we get a  year old girl  year old girls are the best focal point for any story ive been one for yearsand this is a perfect choice because she really never takes time to mope she doesnt miss her faith or wrestle with it she doesnt believe at all and therein lies the genius of pullmans work that has all the christians in a snit shes also the antichristwhy would he do thatbecause the bible does if you really take a look at the word antichrist it does not mean evil khristos from which christ is derived means anointed so what does antichrist really mean unanointed or that which is against the anointed theres a bunch of baggage on top of that meaning which is how we got those omen movies but at the heart of it it just means smeared with fat actually it means recognized by the divine but in ancient times we did that by smearing the recognized thing with the fat of a sacrificed animal or person and that is why we celebrate the crucifixion it was the point of christs birth as if it wasnt obvious enough its why hes referred to as the lambwow so this is heavy pullman has gone all the way back to the origins of the judeochristian faith and said this important guy was just the carrier of this magical stuff that were obsessed with that we dont even use anymore its like were infected or poisoned by this idea we need an antidote we need an antichrist to show us how far weve wandered from the truth which had nothing to do with trooping along after some guyand this explains why christians are so antagonized by the books theyve been following the beast for years without recognizing it the golden compass referred to in the book is the bible weve all forgotten how to read and in its stead weve rallied around the church which claims to help us understand the symbols but in reality it is the beast referred to the one which rose from rome with many heads that change over time so what really is the golden compass about its about how to be human again how to regain an understanding of the world that doesnt rely on our fragile expectations for good and evil all it requires is that you give up everything in order to discover what is important again and i dont know how christians could have missed that primary message   This novel is an absolute work of pure genius and is in my top ten reads of all time Before I go into the depths of character and plot let me start by saying this book is up there with other fantasy hard hitters by this I mean books like The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia the books that define the genre This is high praise indeed and this novel is worthy of it The protagonist of the book is Lyra a young girl who is parentless and seemingly friendless She has grown up in an Oxford College and has developed a detachment to her guardians She spends her days enjoying her youth and harassing those that turn out to be some of her greatest allies For her this book is a journey of selfdiscovery a way of exploring the limits of her character and potential Her adventure sees her befriend an armoured polar bear and become the wielder of the golden compass This is initially described as a lie detector but it is apparent that the depths of its power have not been fully explored It lay heavily in her handsthe crystal face gleaming the brass body exquisitely machined It was very much like a clock or a compass for there were hands pointing around the dial but instead of the hours or the points of a compass there were several little pictures with extraordinary precision as if on ivory with the slenderest sable brush She turned the dial around to look at them all There was an anchor an hourglass surmounted by a skull a bull a beehiveThirtysix altogether and she couldnt even guess what they meantThis book retains all the classic elements of fantasy magic mythical creatures and supernatural phenomena The world Pullman has created is physically intertwined with our own there are references to cities and countries in which his idea has been plantedEach human has a daemon that is essentially their soul These take on the form of an animal that is representative of the person for example someone who is enthusiastic and friendly has a colourful cat whereas as solider has a wolf or a hound The author does very little to explain this It is just thing thing that we are told about at the start but through the book but we begin to see the significance of it The fact that childrens daemons change is a subtle hint how children can be influenced and have not found their identity where as adults are secure and confident In this the author has created an air of mystery as we explore the true meaning of the bond as we read further The plot is fantastic The author manages to surprise the reader on several occasions as he drops several massive plot turns This sees the story go into unexpected directions From the beginning of reading a book you begin to predict what will happen Some books are completely predictable and obvious in their direction this one was not I physically gasped at some moments as I found myself awed by the authors storytelling this is when several characters origins in relation to Lyra are defined The book begins as a simple rescue mission but ends as a story that is questioning the morals of all characters involved The fate of the characters is destined in the mysteriousness of the northern lights the gateway to beyond This is one of those books that is applicable to all ages it originally appears to be a childrens book but it can be enjoyed by anyone Much of the content in here touches on themes that most children would not comprehend fully never mind be able to philosophise about The author considers spirituality religion morals and the existence of the soul amongst other things Most children would not pick up on these references and understand the significance of them however they would still adore the bookThe book can be seen as two separate entities existing at the same time the first and most obvious is the one that appeals to children the saving of innocents from despotic adults with lots of exciting characters The second is on a deeper scale the author explores the conflicting powers of science and religion manipulation and morality in terms of actions being for a greater good In this the author is a genius he has wrote a book that can be both a childrens bed time read and an adults point of pondering   I dont love the BeatlesDucks as he is castigated by the seething massesI also dont love green vegetables punches to the face or going to the dentist though I dont think those revelatory disclosures will elicit much in the way of ragefueled attempts to slit my throat with the jagged edge of a broken CD compact disc kiddoslook it up So why risk a severed jugular on the day before Im going to stuff myself so full of turkey that Ill have a snood coming out of my ear Well because its the best way I can think of to articulate my feelings about The Golden CompassI dont LOVE the Beatles but I recognize their skill and talent and appreciate them for the impact they had on popular music There are Beatles songs that I enjoy I think I might have a Beatles album on my iPod though Ive never actually played it on my iPod But Im never going to suddenly say to myself Geez I really need to hear a Beatles song RIGHT NOW and rush off to listen to one Side note I do occasionally get an urge to listen to Yesterday but just the Boyz II Men versionso perhaps Im not the most qualified judge of musical quality on the planetIs Philip Pullman a Beatleslevel authorial entity Well no But he is a skilled writer with a gift for storytelling and world building Hes a talented technician and stylist But I dont love The Golden Compass I appreciate that its a wellwritten and wellconceived story but as agents revel in saying to me when I pitch them I just didnt connect with the material I can see why people ahem Kristin love this series and I certainly would not dissuade anyone whos interested in reading it from giving it a go Its well doneSomeone asked me as I was finishing this if I was going to check out the second book in the series but I think Ill Let It Be   Once again I didnt dislike this book for the usual reasons and being the kind of person I amYou MUST know Im a advocate for free thought for going against the grain for individuality vs hive mentality   I believe its important to teach children to question to think for themselvesBUTI feel this book crosses a line for its intended audience There is not a single good adult role modelwithout exception they are all selfish devious or outright villainsYou can draw a straight line through all the steps on the path to a childs inevitable conclusion that Adults are the Enemy and to do good to do right you cannot trust or obey themI think thats a very dangerous potentially harmful thing to teach a child You dont have to agree with me In fact the whole reason Im writing this years after I read the book is bc I didnt want to be that person who essentially outlines their own possibly contradictory review on someone elses post Bc those people suck FYI I dont recommend this book for readers not in their teens Yes some children mature faster than others and especially if the child in question is your own youre the best judge of what is appropriate But this is definitely one to screen yourself before passing along to young impressionable minds That is all   LaterA friend said to me today that if you read this book properly it should make you a better person Id just earlier in the day been thinking pretty much the same thing When I asked S in what way was he made better he said he couldnt say just that it had Exactly I think you have a sense as you read this book that Lyras goodness has rubbed off on you shes made you better in an entirely nonspecific wayM then said that she didnt think a book to be special necessarily had to have a moral impact it could give you other terribly important things For her to read the first Harry Potter was to be given back magic And yes an author if he can return to you something you had lost and not even realised you had has done something equally to be treasuredI have promised to read HP soon I find it difficult to believe Im going to get anything out of it but then thus had I felt about Northern Lights last night Im lying in bed Ive been reading this for a couple of hours thinking Im going to get it finished before I fall asleep SMS Won by  be at the pub in ten minutes And Im so torn I even think about bringing the book with me In the end I go to the pub get drunk maybe came close to lucky oh but imagine the morninghaving to play bridge at am on a Sunday on account of the time difference between the US and Australia I didnt see how it would work Hed snuggle up and start saying how great the third time we fucked was and Id be like  is this Dave Or Biff Surely if Id shagged somebody called Biff last night the name would stick wouldnt it Im not going to guess I routinely fail ers so  sorry mate an Australianism will do here but if you could find your way out I have to play bridge in ten minutes Whats that This is YOUR place I open my eyes more and take a better look around Bugger I have to play bridge in ten minutes and I dont even know where I am So Im half way through my second vodka completely drunk already somebodys saying I have a nice firm bosom  I dont think it was Dave OR Biff  and Im wishing after all Id brought my book with me I dont really want to get lucky I want to read my bookAnd even though I havent finished it I wanted to get something about it downI really didnt want to read this Its fantasy it has madeup words it is a trilogy  WHY Why cant somebody write a fantasy book that stops at a decent time There is an explanation of how to pronounce daemon before the book even starts and thats enough to make my heart sink So why am I reading it Because Ive been backed into a corner by a friend and I cant figure out another way of getting out Here it is then A grumpy person reading a type of book they dont want to read and are opening it up for all the wrong reasonsAnd thenstraight away within a page or two what a heartthumper what a brilliant unputdownable ripsnorter Impossible not to compare with Larssons books and comes out so far ahead on all counts I dont know if Ill be able to read the last GirlTattoo book after allThis guy writes well Larsson doesnt He has a plot that is worthy of the name for the entire book When I wanted to stop reading the first Larsson after  pages and was told that it got good soon well honestly I stuck with it and the advice was correct but still Thats a lot of wasted pages Larssons female character is a pastiche of current fashionAntisocialMetal in odd placesPunk rockerShags girls heterosexual male fantasyShags much old men dittoBoob jobComputer whizzLarsson gets away with this even though this amalgam feels fake Lyra needs nothing She is just a girl with nothing special about her at all and she is fabulous Already Im wondering if this series is going to get spoiled by her growing up and sex coming into play One of the things this book demonstrates is how utterly irrelevant and tedious the sex is in books like Larssons It is just there to titillate it has no intrinsic purpose whatsoeverIm gobsmacked by how much more believable this book is than Larssons Daemons talking bears witches universes coming out of universes  Im half expecting a string theorist to pop into the story but as long as that doesnt happen I cant imagine anything could spoil the rest of it Im trying to picture who wouldnt enjoy this and Im coming up with a complete prune of a person If I enjoy this honestly anybody would And yes ladies and gentlemen Im even going to give the rest of the series a goFinished The last forty pages or so after the duel of the bears lost me Maybe because they werent really about the story they are about setting the scene for the next bookI dont know But I have to say that after  pages where every sentence made my heart beat too fast I feel rather churlish saying that   "},

Arawns terrible cohorts After a winter expedition filled with danger Tarans army arrives at Mount Dragon Arawns stronghold There in a thrilling confrontation with Arawn and the evil enchantress Achren Taran is forced to make the most crucial decision of his life There are times in life where everything seems to go right and then there are the times where everything seems to go wrong The High King is both of these There were times I wanted to throw the book down and times I couldnt even bear to close it at night The book while a fairy tale is lifeNothing in life is free and all things come with a price even the price of gifts that we wish we could keep And the gift that requires the greatest price is that of love People change move and die Those we love do not forever remain with us and love is not without its trials and pain But though we may give up what we think we desire in life in the endif it were for lovewe know that it was worth itThere are many examples of forgoing ones hearts desire in order to do that which is for the greater good In the end our lives can either be lived for our own good or for the good of those who come after I know which life I will choose to lead How about you   This is to date one of the best childrens novels Ive read in one of the best childrens series out there Alexander draws on a wealth of Welsh mythology to put together a rags to riches story of a pigkeeper his growth from child to youth to man and the decisions we are all forced to make in adulthood There were many different types of closure in the final book  the first time I read it I cried which is really rare for me I found the portrayals of key characters moving as well as the stories surrounding the protagonist Taran and his essential core of friends and supporters     stars  Metaphorosis ReviewsArawn DeathLord has Gwydions magic sword and he has sent out his dread armies to conquer Prydain With only the slimmest of hopes Taran and Gwydion must raise an army and strike at Arawns stronghold to try to end his evil once and for allThe High King is not the strongest of Lloyd Alexanders Prydain quintet Hes building here on an established foundation and much of the outcome in a YA adventure is foreordained Still for all that theres little suspense familiar wellloved characters are here to follow the path marked and theyve grown up a little as theyve gone Taran is wiser Eilonwy slightly less flighty Gurgi Fflewddur Doli Kaw and all the crew make their appearances including some characters readers may have forgottenThere are a few surprises in the book which is more somber than its predecessors And if much goes as it must at least its well done The ending however is disappointing We all know what will happen and why  in part because the story echoes so many other familiar tales I wish that Alexander had worked just a little more magic here and reached for closure in a somewhat more original way That may be asking too much from a series that unabashedly drew from many sources including Welsh mythology in particularAside from a weak ending the book is a fitting conclusion to the series And if youve read the first four books youre going to read this one Its not the best of the batch but its still good and itll do your heart good to know where Taran Eilonwy and even HenWen the oracular pig have ended up   Single review for the Chronicles of Prydain as they are similar in style and quality and could have been produced as a single large volume of five subbooks The Chronicles of Prydain are childrens books Some childrens books hold up well when read by an adult but these are definitely for kids and do not carry any added depth The adventures are amusing but flat You might smile at Eilonwys sass and moxie and Fflewdur Fflams tall tales But youre probably also going to cringe at Tarans extreme earnestness and dogoodery or Gwydions noblestofallnobles nobility and maybe youll tire a bit of Gurgi who is Prydains very own Jar Jar Binks If youre reading this and youre already grown up it might be too late to get full enjoyment out of these books The Welsh mythology Alexander spins into the stories adds some nice color and in fact now having read these books I read the first two when I was much younger and the last three for the first time recently I am interested in reading the Mabinogion the Welsh medieval folk stories from which Alexander drew much inspiration I suspect a grownup audience might find these richer and rawer just as a grownup audience might prefer reading the Bible over one of those bowdlerized childrens Bible stories collections Try these if you havent hit your growth spurts yet but for my time and money Id rather have simply reread the Lord of the Rings    This one felt more rushed than the others some of the big reveals were really disappointing like other books in the series more time is spent on their daily trivialities than the big picture the death of the main antagonist of the entire series was addressed in a fight lasting no more than a page it felt anticlimactic arawn was killed too easily lesser villains were given better fights and deaths I hated glew better characters than him died whilst we had to endure his whining for an entire book the ending was somewhat similar to lord of the rings but not as impacting or meaningful overall I wouldve been happier if I had skipped this one and dreamt up my own ending for the companions which is really a shame the characters were crafted with love and personality but by the end it just falls flat   "},

"text": "For fifteen years FitzChivalry Farseer has lived in selfimposed exile assumed to be dead by almost all who once cared about him But now into his isolated life visitors begin to arrive Fitzs mentor from his assassin days a hedgewitch who foresees the return of a longlost love and the Fool the former White Prophet who beckons Fitz to fulfill his destinyThen comes the summons he cannot ignore Prince Dutiful the young heir to the Farseer throne has vanished Fitz possessed of magical skills both royal and profane is the only one who can retrieve him in time for his betrothal ceremony thus sparing the Six Duchies profound political embarrassment    or worse But even Fitz does not suspect the web of treachery that awaits himor how his loyalties will be tested to the breaking point The characterisation of Fitschivalry through the series is brilliant The books are told from the first person entirely thus the reader witnesses the change in his thoughts as he grows into a man In this book he has developed a new persona Tom Badgerlock This is set fifteen years after the Red Ship wars and King Veritys reawakening of the Dragons Tom Badgerlock is the person Fitschivalry has evolved into the one he always wanted to be he is the man with a simple life a small farm a few friends and the close companionship of his loyal wolf His reaction is unsurprising when his former mentor and friend comes seeking his help reluctance Prince Dutiful heir to the Farseer throne has gone missing Nobody seems to know why He is suspected of having the Wit and is known to have an undeveloped grasp of the Skill Tom Badgerlock doesnt want to go back to being the tool of the Farseer throne their Assassin Who can blaim him He wants to be free Slow but excellent Few authors of the fantasy genre if any could write a book in which the first third of it is essentially the protagonist living in a hut looking back on his youth as he weighs up the decisions of the future In this Robin Hobbs style is remarkable The internal conflict of Fitz really spoke to me Fitz has earned his rest but at the same time he is the only person who can bring stability to the realm he must go back to Buckeep and the role of his youth The novel is very well paced and probably the most apprehension evoking Ive read in fantasy the author knows how to draw the plot out revealing more information at exactly the right time The plot could have been over and done with in three hundred pages or so but that would not have achieved the same effect The emotions of Fitz his fears and worries all play a pivotal role in establishing the suspense of the plot and only through his vivid characterisation do we as the reader understand the meaning behind his decisions Wonderful MagicA theme has been established through the book through the use of animals almost defining the authors style The thoughts of animals have been brought to life their personalities exhibit their animalistic traits For example the cats snobbish nature and vainglorious attitude to itself is captured in the thoughts it sends to Tom Badgerlock This is my favourite aspect of the series the Wit magic It is a wonderful idea The relationship between Fitz and Nighteyes is very touching Their bond along with the Fools closeness to them is very deep They are almost one person as their wit bond has rubbed off characteristics onto each other The Wolf thinks like a human and the Man acts like a wolf I liked this development and how it becomes tested as Nighteyes ages quicker than Fitz Robin Hobb is one of my favourite fantasy novelists third only to Tolkien and Susanna Clarke her books define the modern fantasy genre thus theyre a must read for any fantasy enthusiast    This is more or less what I look like whenever FitzChivalry Farseer is involvedSo many books later and Im still feeling berprotective of Fitz I got furious with his neighbour when he attacked Fitz in the market place I wanted to kick Starling out of the door and none too gently and I was even too angry to cry when the inevitable happened view spoilerand Nighteyes dies It was  pages in the making and still I was shocked  What Robin Hobb manages to do is quite amazing in fact She writes very factual very matteroffact but it makes the reader react in a very emotional way You get upset you want to shout at the characters you think they are the silliest person on earth but the next moment youre grinning from ear to ear and everything is all right with the world again I love it Apart from the invasion of your emotional kingdom there are two other things that make me love these books so much One the characters are so real its almost surreal This includes the animals I was so impressed with the simple things Robin Hobb does to bring the cats to life for instance Pet me youll feel better That does feel so catlikeTwo the way she writes her stories and keeps you guessing What happened How did we get there Is there still a way out of here Whos the girl he keeps talking about Did Nettle tell about her dreams at the breakfast table and if yes what did her parents think of that And I can keep going like that for a few pages if need beSeriously I dread the day I run out of Robin Hobb books to readbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   Again Robin Hobb demonstrates that you dont need to write grimdark to generate realism high drama or sinister undertones Now I love my grimdark as much as Hannibal loves liver phphpht but Hobbs realism is expressed in believable characters complex relationships detailed worldbuildingwait wait wait a minute nowwhat about blood and guts Yes there will be blood too but the joojoo is not in the gore  the joojoo is in the sustained threat of violence  the joojoo is in the way the sense of danger and foreboding creeps up on you and builds and seduces you until you cant help but keep turning pages You just have to know what is going to happen next That was my experience anywayThe story begins at a leisurely pace as we catch up to Fitz in his selfimposed exile some  years after the events of the Farseer Trilogy We get a taste of what a life of peace with his wolf Nighteyes is like I make it sound boring but its not Fitz has been to some interesting places and done some interesting things in those  years  including a visit to Bingtown and the Rainwilds which those fans who have read The Liveship Traders series will appreciate If youve skipped that Trilogy to come straight over to Tawny Man then I think you are missing out Most people do it because they want more of the Fool  more Fool you I say  because there is more Fool in Liveships  so technically that would be more Fool to those who read Liveships first Damn Fool bastard has me talking in circlesBut back to the Bastard  Robin Hobbno Im not calling her a bastard still manages to reintroduce us to an older Fitz and catch us up in a way that is interesting despite being slow Even when Fitz is doing nothing I still wanted to know what he was going to do next as his old life calls out to him And the pace and tension keep increasing from there as Chades old apprentice Asssassin is called on to do his duty for his Queen and the Farseer throne And in Robin Hobbs world duty  is spelled PAIN So though we know Fitz cant die seeing the story is told from his POV in the first person we should know by now that he is never safe We should know by now that there are worse things that can happen to Fitz than dying and we should know that Robin Hobb does not hold back from inflicting them on our protagonist Did I just say Robin Hobb isnt a bastard starsAnd now a quick word from out sponsor Lord GoldenFitz is Dutiful to Fitz DutifulPsst  Fool says Robin Hobb really is a bastardbitch sadistget off me Im the White Prophet and I will be heard Fool says you should read her next book as soon as possible   Do not you sense it A crossroads a vertex a vortex All paths change from hereThis book made my cry Multiple timesI dont often cry while reading books I takes a lot And I might blame it on pregnancy hormones except Hobb made me cry in her last two series Liveship Traders and Farseer Trilogy and when I read those I wasnt pregnantBut this book again has ruined me In a good wayRobin Hobb is the type of author that slowly builds her story She introduces her character and you live their daily lives and truly get to know them Some people may find it boring But I know it is just the beginning You begin to develop feelings for her characters They can be positive feelings or the most negative feelings you have ever experiencedThe truth  I discovered is a tree that grows as a man gains access to experience A child sees the acorn of his daily life  but a man looks back on the oakShe then spends the remainder of the book turning your opinions on their head as her characters change and evolve in very real ways as events unfold in this fabulous world she has createdSome speak of the savagery of beasts I will ever prefer that to the thoughtless contempt some men have toward animalsIt is the work of an amazing authorShe doesnt need to keep your attention with epic battle scenes but maintains it more subtly with stunning language and unforgettable characters    Entre dolor soledad y desconsuelo trato de escribir estas lneas para intentar describir lo que me dej o ms exactamente

"text": "The fifth book in Robert Jordans internationally bestselling epic fantasy series THE WHEEL OF TIME now reissued with a stunning new cover design The bonds and wards that hold the Great Lord of the Dark are slowly failing but still his fragile prison holds The Forsaken immortal servants of the shadow weave their snares and tighten their grip upon the realms of men sure in the knowledge that their master will soon break freeRand al Thor the Dragon Reborn knows that he must strike at the Enemy but his forces are divided by treachery and by ambition Even the Aes Sedai ancient guardians of the Light are riven by civil war Betrayed by his allies pursued by his enemies and beset by the madness that comes to the male wielders of the One Power Rand rides out to meet the foe ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy LiteratureFor being such a long book nearly  pages in my trade paperback copy amazingly little happens in The Fires of Heaven and this is why so many readers have abandoned this otherwise interesting story Approximately the first third of the novel contains so much recap and repetition that if Id had my hair in a proper braid I would have been yanking it as often as Nynaeve doesThe formula for the first  pages or so goes something like this One or two lines of dialogue two paragraphs of backstory another line of dialogue another couple of paragraphs of backstory It felt like the proverbial one step forward two steps backI managed to stick with it though only because I was listening to it on audiobook and therefore only half listening while I accomplished something else at the same time and because I wanted to write a review Besides I found it immensely entertaining when I could complete Robert Jordans sentences for him In The Fires of Heaven we never see Perrin or Faile which is fine with me There is an interesting plotline involving Siuan Sanche Logain and Gareth Bryne Rands adoption of Asmodean is entertaining too  I like that were not really sure which side Asmodean and Lanfear are on The plot does finally move forward a bit but it takes way too long to do so The book could have easily been cut to half its size and been better for it If I had been the editor I would have taken a blue pencil to all instances of females obsessing about the modesty of their clothing males obsessing about the modesty of female clothing needless skirt smoothing and straightening silk clinging to hips and breasts shivering or sweating that has nothing to do with the weather disgusted talk about not understanding the opposite sex braid pulling tugging and yanking sniffing thoughts or actual instances of bottoms being switched or spanked Nynaeves cat fightsAt this point Im quickly loosing patience as The Wheel of Time quickly looses steam Thats a shame because the story itself is very good  but its just too hard to extract it from the drossRead more Robert Jordan book reviews at    Storms rumble beyond the horizon and the fires of heaven purge the earth There is no salvation without destruction no hope this side of deathThe White Tower is shattered by a brutal struggle for power The remaining Forsaken enter the fray as kings and queens dance to their tunes in secret And the greatest army the Westlands have seen in thousands of years emerge from the Waste as the clans of the Aiel cross the Spine of the World at the command of He Who Comes With The DawnThe Fires of Heaven is unfortunately not as interesting as previous instalments in the Wheel of Time series To briefly summarise there were three hundred pages of following a travelling circus chapter upon chapter of nothing happening in the Aiel Waste very little action at all and quite a lot of talking And precious little interesting talking mind youStill reading this book was like taking a break after a long and tedious workout session Its most important strength was that the main characters previously dubbed the worst characters in fantasy by this particular reviewer seems to have improved immensely Rand alThor while further exploring the depths of madness behaves rather civilly for once both Egwene and Mat turn into characters I can respect perhaps even like Aviendha and Nynaeve have become almost tolerable and Perrin and Faile dont even appear So in one way at least this was a series highlight so farMins early POV chapters were great and so were Rands late ones Watching Siuan Sanche race across the countryside with a gentled false Dragon in tow and encountering a bunch of interesting characters was perfectly enjoyable As was reading about the Aiel and their second crossing of the Spine of the World So there were certainly great parts included in this book as wellThe ending was definitely not as good as the one in The Shadow Rising but neither would anyone expect it to be The book as a whole was unremarkable and not particularly impressive but the almost complete lack of negative qualities made me able to appreciate the insane worldbuilding skills of Robert Jordan even more And for the first time in a while Im very much looking forward to reading the next book in this series                                              What I like to call Volume  in the Women Hating Men trilogy At almost no point in these three books did women interacting with men consist of anything beyond insulting men assaulting men sniffing at men or thinking about how stupid men are compared to all the omniscient women I almost didnt finish this book because of all the negative energy towards menLessons I learned from this trilogy It is always a mans fault Always Women are always smarter than men It is okay to break your promises as long as they were to a man Hitting a man is a perfectly acceptable response to anything he says If a man proves you wrong it is okay to lie about it and also hit him A man raping a woman is a horrible crime A woman raping a man is funny A man of his word is easy to manipulateThe best part of this whole trilogy was the end of book  Lord of Chaos because we finally saw some turnabout in the men vs women thingSeriously what kind of women did Robert Jordan have in his life He was utterly incapable of creating a strong female character without also making her a hateful spiteful harpy They are either spineless doormats or unbearable battleaxes The only reason this one has a second star in its rating is because he actually moves the plot along in interesting ways   Its funny because if you read others reviews of this book youll notice that folks start to split into two camps Theyre either ridiculously addicted and love it or theyre getting frustrated They dont want a  plus page book in a series that should have been a trilogy They dont like the fact that Jordan is getting all epic on your ass in this continuing study of the adventures of our characters They dont like the fact that there are  more books after this one in the seriesIm firstcamping it YepI personally love the fact that Im not finished with this book and done with the series It aint over folks not by a long shot Id say Keep em coming but Robert Jordan died and the th book is probably being written by someone else so that phrase isnt likely to be crazyfulfilled Still dangKeep em coming   The Wheel weaves as The Wheel wills  this is Moiraines favorite saying In this book all of the Forsaken plot against The Dragon Reborn practically in broad daylight high lords and ladies in different kingdoms pursue their own interests  the Dark One be damned and the troubles in the White Tower split the Aes Sedai into two fractions The interesting part about the latter is that I counted exactly two arguably three full Aes Sedai who try to support The Dragon Reborn with only one of them  Moiraine  being able to actively do it I will talk about her laterSo what are the major players doing in this book Mat is the most interesting character in this book period Mat is the most interesting character in the series for that matter as well as one of the most interesting characters in fantasy in general He tries to escape his taveren pull only to end up as one of the best generals of the realm with a devoted army Rand still tries to understand Aiel culture be independent from both Aes Sedai and Wise Ones and learn something useful from his Forsaken pet while keeping him on a leash He also has to play the Game of Houses extremely intricate political maneuvering with the best of emPerrin is not in the book at all in fact his name was only briefly mentioned twice Egwene does not have a POV but she quickly becomes one of the most arrogant characters in the series being able to outmatch any Aes Sedai of the Wise One in that department  and this says a lotMoiraine on the other hand suddenly learned humility  probably the first Aes Sedai who really knows the meaning of the word  and I found that I can really sympathize with her in the book sadly she does not have a POV eitherNynaeve and Elaine try to escape first from a country torn by a civil war and then from Whitecloaks stronghold They try to reach the White Tower unaware of the changes in there and the fact that they would be treated like prisoners instead of heroes as the pair hope To make their life more exciting they are hunted by remaining known Black Ajah lead by an extremely pissed off Forsaken Elaine acts sensible and normal for a change she also does not have a lot of POV in the book Nynaeve is the reason why some people complain about this book being a little slow at times I need to explain some things Nynaeve in the world of dreams shines and nothing she does in there is boring  and some things are outright heroic  but in the real world she still tries to bully everybody into obedience while doing this with a grace of an elephant in a china shop It works fine as a comic relief but seems like complete waste of pages if you take it seriously I also need to point out the she is the only Aes Sedai  I am talking about a very broad definition of this term  who actually helped The Dragon Reborn and she did it without any hidden agenda In fact she mentioned several times that the only two reasons she became Aes Sedai are to help him and to learn healing I can support and understand both All in all this is a solid  star book with some very occasional slow  but not boring  pages Expect major power shifts by the end of it    "},

stuck in bed for several days due to oh a giant surgical wound in my neck My doctor said I had to stay in bed for a few days So I reasoned what better way than to resume my attempt at reading one of the greatest literary classics of all time than whole having no other optionAudiobook it was I didnt last past Tom Bombadil before I decided fuck this Im going to head to the gym with a bloody bandage on my neck True story I got a lot of really weird looks My doctor gave me a prescription for Vicodin because he was concerned the pain would be too much to bear Apparently I didnt even need the Vicodin because that pedophile Tom Bombadil put me right to sleepSeriously were it not for the fact that it is written by Tolkien I would have hated this book It was so unbelievably dull There were parts that to a Tolkien amateur like me didnt have a whit of relevance or anything interesting to add to the plot namely say the first  pages of the book Seriously what the fuck is up with the farmer and Tom BombadilThe plot was all sorts of disjointed Some parts just didnt make any sense Tolkien is a linguist at heart and it shows because all the famous quotes we know from him are just sound bytes In context sometimes they dont really make any sense All the poems and songs are in there to sound pretty and frankly they bored the fuck out of meFor instance in the middle of a serious dinner party where the company is just trying to decide what to do about the ring surely a simple task all of a sudden little Frodo stands up and solemnly announces  I was like what the fuck man Where did that come from It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the scene Oh sure its an inside thing on how Aragorn was the secret king but nobody knew that Everyone elf hobbit dwarf and me would have thought he was completely high on some elven grassLet me make this clear I do not for an instance doubt Tolkiens literary value I think he has been an inspiration to generations of writers artists hell gamers My beloved World of Warcraft game featured elves pretty much every fantasy book we have these days have been inspired in one way or another by Tolkien Again he was an amazing linguist his work developing the Elvish tongue among others as well as his efforts in developing the rich fantastic history of the world within his books is not to be disregarded by any meansBut again he is a linguist He is a scholar He may be the most brilliant one of those in the world an inspiration to generations but for me personally his writing is not to my tastesBut damn the movies were amazing   Authors who inspire a movement are usually misunderstood especially by those they have inspired and Tolkien is no exception but one of the biggest misconceptions about Tolkien is the idea that he is somehow an innovator of fantasy He did add a number of techniques to the repertoire of epic fantasy writers and these have been dutifully followed by his many imitators but for the most part these techniques are little more than bad habitsMany have called Tolkien by such epithets as The Father of Fantasy but anyone who makes this claim simply does not know of the depth and history of the fantasy genre For those who are familiar with the great and influential fantastical authors from Ovid and Ariosto to Eddison and Dunsany to RE Howard and Fritz Leiber it is clear that long before Tolkien fantasy was already a complex wellestablished and even a respected literary genreEddisons work contains an invented world a carefullyconstructed and wellresearched archaic language a powerful and unearthly queen and a central character who is conflicted and lost between the forces of nobility and darkness Poul Andersons    which came out the same year as The Fellowship of the Ring has distant haughty elves deepdelving dwarves a broken sword which must be reforged an epic war between the armies of light and darkness another central character trapped between those extremes and an interweaving of Christian and Pagan worldviewsSo if these aspects are not unique to Tolkien then what does set him apart Though Dunsany Eddison and Anderson all present worlds where light and dark come into conflict they present these conflicts with a subtle and often ironic touch recognizing that morality is a dangerous thing to present in absolutes Tolkien or CS Lewis on the other hand has no problem in depicting evil as evil good as good and the only place they meet is in the temptation of an honest heart as in Gollums caseand even then he is not like Eddisons Lord Gro or Andersons Scafloc characters who live under an alternative view of the world but instead fluctuates between the highs and lows of Tolkiens dualistic moralityIt is a dangerous message to make evil an external irrational thing to define it as the unknown that opposes us because it invites the reader to overlay their own morality upon the world which is precisely what most modern fantasy authors tend to do following Tolkiens example Whether its Goodkinds Libertarianism or John Normans sex slave fetish its very easy to simply create a magical allegory to make one side right and the other side wrong and you never have to develop a dramatic narrative that actually explores the soundness of those ideas Make the good guys dress in bright robes or silvery maile and the bad guys in black spiky armor and a lot of people will never notice that all the good guys are White upper class men while all the bad guys are brutish foreigners and that both sides are killing each other and trying to rule their little corner of the worldIn Tolkiens case his moral view was a very specific evocation of the ideal of Merrie England which is an attempt by certain stodgy old Tories like Tolkien to rewrite history so that the nobility were all good and righteous leaders the farmers were all happy in their proper place working a simple patch of dirt while both industrialized cultures and the primitives who resided to the South and East were the enemy bent on despoiling the natural beauty of England despite the fact that the isles had been flattened deforested and partitioned a thousand years beforeThough Tom Bombadil remains as a strangely incoherent reminder of the moral and social complexity of the fantasy tradition upon which Tolkien draws he did his best to scrub the rest clean spending years of his life trying to fit Catholic philosophy more wholly into his Pagan adventure realm But then thats often how we think of Tolkien bent over his desk spending long hours researching notetaking compiling and playing with language Even those who admit that Tolkien demonstrates certain racist sexist and classicist leanings as indeed do many great authors still praise the complexity of his world buildingAnd any student of the great Epics like the Norse Eddas the Bible or the Shahnameh can see what Tolkien is trying to achieve with his worldbuilding those books presented grand stories but were also about depicting a vast world of philosophy history myth geography morality and culture They were encyclopedic texts intended to instruct their people on everything important in life and they are extraordinarily valuable to students of anthropology and history because even the smallest detail can reveal something about the world which the book describesSo Tolkien fills his books with troop movements dull songs lines of lineage and references to his own madeup history mythology and language He has numerous brieflymentioned side characters and events because organic texts like the epics which were formed slowly over time and compiled from many sources often contained such digressions He creates characters who have similar nameswhich is normally a stupid thing to do as an author because it is so confusingbut hes trying to represent a hereditary tradition of prefixes and suffixes and shared names which many great families of history had So Tolkien certainly had a purpose in what he did but was it a purpose that served the story he was trying to tellSimply copying the form of reality is not what makes good art Art is meaningfulit is directed It is not just a list of detailseverything within is carefully chosen by the author to make up a good story The addition of detail is not the same as adding depth especially since Tolkiens world is not based on some outside systemit is whatever he says it is Its all arbitrary which is why the only thing that grants a character scene or detail purpose is the meaning behind it Without that meaning then what Tolkien is doing is just a very elaborate thought exercise Now its certainly true that many people have been fascinated with studying it but thats equally true of many thought exercises such as the rules and background of the Pokemon card game or crossword puzzlesOstensibly Scrabble supposedly is a game for people who love wordsand yet top Scrabble players sit an memorize lists of words whose meaning they will never learn Likewise many literary fandom games become little more than word searches find this reference connect that name to this characterbut which have no meaning or purpose outside of that The point of literary criticism is always to lead us back to human thought and ideas to looking at how we think and express ourselves If a detail in a work cannot lead us back to ourselves then it is no more than an arbitrary piece of chaffThe popularity of Tolkiens work made it acceptable for other authors to do the same thing to the point that whenever I hear a book lauded for the depth of its world building I expect to find a mess of obsessive detailing of piling on so many inconsequential facts and figures that the characters and stories get buried under the scree as if the author secretly hopes that by spending most of the chapter describing the heros cuirass well forget that hes a bland archetype who only succeeds through happy coincidence and deus ex machina against an enemy with no internal structure or motivationWhen QuillerCouch said authors should murder their darlings this is what he meant just because you have hobbies and opinions does not mean you should fill your novel with them Anything which does not materially contribute to the story characters and artistry of a work can safely be left out Tolkiens embarrassment of detail also produced a huge inflation in the acceptable length of fantasy books leading to the meandering unending series that fill bookstore shelves todayNow there are several notable critics who have lamented the unfortunate effect that Tolkiens work has had on the genre such as in Moorcocks    and Mievilles diatribe about every modern fantasy author being forced to come to terms with the old dons influence I agree with their deconstructions but for me Tolkien isnt some special author some fantasy granddad looming over all Hes just a bump in the road one author amongst many in a genre that stretches back thousands of years into our very ideas of myth and identity and not one of the more interesting onesHis ideas werent unique and while his approach may have been unusual it was only because he spent a lifetime trying obsessively to make something artificial seem more natural despite the fact that the point of fantasy and fiction in general is to explore the artificial the human side of the equation to look at the world through the biased lens of our eye and to represent some odd facet of the human condition Unfortunately Tolkiens characters structure and morality are all too flat to suggest much no matter how many fauxorganic details he surrounds them withMy Fantasy Book Suggestions   A review of Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring by SauronHello You may remember me as the title character of the Lord of Rings I go by a lot of names Dark Lord of Mordor Sorcerer Red Eye Dark Power Lord of Baraddr Ringmaker and Base Master of Treachery I use that one in my band I actually object to Tolkiens chosen name of Sauron which I understand originates from an adjective that means foul putrid in his crappy invented language What can I say the showers in Mordor are sketchy at best On weekends my poker buddies call me Sauron the Destroyer of Nacho Platters Because Tolkien intentionally failed to give a proper description of me in his books allow me to give you an idea I have a bit of a dark look My quest for world domination having been thwarted I watch a lot of TV these days My body is roughly equivalent to the The Situation on Jersey Shore Oh no I dont watch that but the Witchking of Angmar is obsessed He wont shut up about Snowcone or some bimbo on that show Im missing a finger which while preventing me from raining down carnage on Middle Earth allows me to collect decent EI Plus the best lawyer in Mordor got me covered under the dismemberment clause on my insurance so Im riding the double dip gravy train Much has been written about my terrible Lidless Red Eye blah blah blah It freaked out that little twat Frodo pretty good Ill have you know that conjunctivitis is no laughing matter Having to keep it open  to look for hoodlums skulking around Mordor is murder on my hydration The Nazgul have enough lift and aim to get up there to toss a bucket of Visine at it but its just temporary relief Regardless Im still more of a looker than your precious King Elessar or Aragorn or whatever hes calling himself these days Hes never met a brooding look he didnt like Buy a razor Get a real jobSomeone sent me Peter Jacksons movies in the mail The package had no return address but it was postmarked Hobbiton where ever the hell that is As I watch these movies over and over I never even finished the books I was reminded of all my mistakesPerhaps a ring was not a good choice Some buddies have suggested that maybe I shouldnt have tied all of my terrible powers to something as easy to misplace as the One Ring In retrospect I should have forged The One Gas Station Bathroom Key Chain of Power It would have been a lot harder to tief I even could have pimped it out by making it from an Ent branch or Sarumans foot for all the good that old fart did me Maybe a ring would have been just fine if it had been a toe ring Then it wouldnt glow in the dark like a target for every freaking Man on the battlefield I heard that the guy who beat me was named Isildur WTF Maybe I could have worn tougher gloves I dont know Perhaps the door to the Fires of Mount Doom should have had a better lock ADT could have hooked me up with motion detectors but I hear that even cats can set those off They claim they can calibrate them but Im not so sure The Urukhai are always jumping up on the table so they would set it off for sure Maybe just the alarm that goes off if something hits the lava like pool alarms for kid Although I guess it would have been too late by then My preccciioouussss Learn some balance aholeFrodo That little prick Id rather not discuss how my quest for utter dominion was defeated by something I could poop out unnoticedIm getting off track Im supposed to discuss the events of the first book the Fellowship of the Ring Good times I was on a comeback Then the withered up senior citizen Gandalf had to go to the library and do a little research and figure out that my Ring was not some cracker jack prize My Ringwraiths tried to track down the Ring but apparently taking it away from children was too difficult If I had put the Nazgl on fell beasts rather than bloody horses from the start I might have tracked down Frodo prick and his three buddies in the bloody woods Dont horses have a good sense of smell Anyways the fell beasts would have at least avoided drowning in a river Sweet Mary Then those Elves suggest a damn fellowship Could you have come up with a lamer group name Why not call it the Loose Association of People Who Share Common Beliefs or Activitiesof the Ring That Balrog almost did me the biggest favour he was always one of my peeps You shall not pass What a line Gandy How cow I heard that one took like  takes because Pippin kept making everyone laugh by adding in the word gas Fool of a TookAnyways by the end of the Fellowship of the Ring I still had a fighting chance Great book Anyways The Two Towers wont be as fun to review Sht hits the fan A note from Saurons agent full credit for the idea of this review goes to Kemper and his awesome review of Drood   I wasnt really cool back in high school I never made out with girls under the bleachers or smoked under the bleachers or did any of the other things under the bleachers that  I am lead to believe  the popular kids did Instead I maintained a low profile and waited for the teenage years  that wilderness of strangled thinking  to endIn high school as today I harbored geekish obsessions had a wandering imagination and nurtured an appreciation for minutiate In other words I should have been JRR Tolkiens core audience For whatever reason  perhaps intuition that I didnt need to dig my social hole any deeper  I never read The Lord of the Rings when most people first come upon The Lord of the Rings Actually I was barely cognizant of LOTR until college when the movies were released I absolutely loved Peter Jacksons film trilogy During law school I left a legal writing final halfway through in order to see Return of the King on opening day Despite this I never desired to read the source material From talking to my friends who were Tolkien enthusiasts nerds I assumed I wouldnt like the books They seemed too talky dense and plodding Finally one fair summer night on my patio my friend Jon and I were drinking beer and talking about The Lord of the Rings and how it was funny we could do this openly and still have significant others of the opposite sex I believe my wife was inside at the time deciding what she would take in the divorce Somehow in a Miller Light and bratwurst haze Jon got me to commit to giving LOTR a try Then I did a keg stand with Jons homemade beer This is how I read Now having finished Fellowship of the Ring I have new appreciation for what Peter Jackson accomplished Yeah he made it into an action film but thats the medium of film there needs to be action He did a fine job of taking Tolkiens essence and goosing it Sometimes he goosed the action too much but we can discuss Legolas surfing on his shield at Helms Deep another day It was this love of the film that interestingly made me hesitant to read the books Folks who love Tolkien love Tolkien with a vengeance If it isnt obvious already I dont have that underlying feeling I understand theoretically Tolkiens achievement but Im not going to pretend to know all the references  religious mythic and linguistic  used as ingredients What I do know is that at its heart LOTR is an archetypal heros journey It begins with an orphan of average abilities who has a task thrust upon him This forces the hero to leave home and enter the wider world In the world he must pass tests learn lessons and eventually accomplish his task Once that is done the hero can return home however he is forever changed and the home to which he returns is differentThe hero in LOTR is Frodo Baggins a hobbit Now a hobbit is  well theyre short but theyre not dwarves Thats the important thing to remember Hobbits are like potsmoking liberal arts majors They like to hang around eat smoke drink and talk Frodos uncle Bilbo is a rare hobbit who has gone out and had adventures He also has a magic ring which he gives to Frodo This ringwell its evil I could explain more and Tolkien certainly does but suffice it to say the ring is a Macguffin Its like Marcellus Wallaces suitcase in Pulp Fiction it drives the plot and thats all you need to know This being Tolkien though you are certainly able to learn much much much more Bilbo and Frodos friend the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo that he must take the ring to the Cracks of Doom to destroy it lest the Dark Shadow Sauron get his figurative hands upon it With this the journey starts Frodo is joined by three other hobbits Sam the loyal one Pippin the scared one and Merry the one portrayed by Losts Dominic Monaghan After some brushes with the Nine Ridersthe Nazgulthe Ring Wraiths Tolkien has a very Russian way of making up a name and then making up two or three or four synonyms which makes things a little confusing the hobbits meet up with AragornStrider who leads them to Rivendell where the elves live under Elrond There is a counsel the Fellowship is joined by Boromir a man Legolas an elf and Gimli a dwarf It all sounds like the setup for a very complicated joke But rest assured the fate of MiddleEarth is at stake Though that does not stop the characters from stopping repeatedly for long meals apparently the Fellowship is comprised of foodies and gourmands Its important to note what this book is not it is not an actionpacked adventure Mostly it is people walking through this makebelieve world talking about the past and worrying about the future There is a battle in the mountains of Moria that lasts for two pages other than that there are only scattered paragraphs when people are running swords are unsheathed and the stakes are raised If swords and arrows are what you seek just stick to the films Moreover you arent going to find complex characterizations The good guys are varing shades of good and the bad guys are really bad About the only conflicted characters are Boromir who is conflicted for five sentences or so and Gollum the strungout ringaddict So what is the book Well its a place you visit Anyone who knows me knows that I am a Nyquill connoisseur or addict take your pick I often need something to calm my overactive mind before I can get to sleep Instead of the Quill for the past weeks I used Fellowship This is a compliment Tolkiens world is so immersive so fully realized  with its varied races songs languages and lore  that whenever you open the covers its a sublime escape You are in an ancient land filled with a rich and ancient history and a wonderfully described topography Sure the shadow of war hangs over MiddleEarth but there is no tension If you feel like Frodo is in mortal danger and might not accomplish his task youre probably six years old and having the story read aloud Reading Fellowship was simply comforting I wouldnt mind a kindly wizard giving me sage advice Many that live deserve death And some that die deserve life Can you give it to them Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment For even the very wise cannot see all endsAnd I also wouldnt mind going on a little hike through the forest and maybe hanging out with some elvesAway high in the East swung Remmirath the Netted Stars and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the Swordsman of the Sky Menelvagor with his shining belt The Elves burst into song Suddenly under teh trees a fire sprang with light Come the Elves called to the hobbits Come Now is the time for speech and merrimentAt the south end of the greensward there was an opening There the greenfloor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side In the middle there was a woodfire blazing and upon the treepillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily The Elves sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink others brought food on heaped plates and dishesFrodos journey is secondary to Tolkiens creation of MiddleEarth And the genius of MiddleEarth is that it goes beyond the pages With its allusions to a long history filled with famous leaders and famous events and famous battles your imagination is ignited Upon finishing the first book I saw how LOTR became a place of refuge for the outcasts and iconoclasts of our world Like comic books it is a place of escape where the everyday order is turned upside down the stakes are high the heroes short the beer is plentiful and girls a distant afterthought          What started up as an adventure oriented for children turned into an epic fantasyTHE epic fantasy book anything else in the genre after this born here any other author writing in this field began here and even impacted in many other genres and formatsCertainly in The Hobbit there are dangers there is death so thinking about it as a childrens tale is a much debated issue but its clear that Tolkiens intention was to present a lighthearted adventure   However due some communications troubles between Tolkien and the publishing house making him to think that they werent enjoying the proposed sequel to The Hobbit the story got bigger larger darkerand redefined the conception of epic fantasy in literarureEven Tolkien needed to rewrite the chapter in The Hobbit involving Bilbo Gollum and the One Ring since the story known as The Lord of the Rings became something that even the very Tolkien didnt foreseen beforeSo what began as a small hobbit living in a hole that found a tiny ring in his journey turned into a visceral war involving the whole MiddleEarth    I have a theory about the One Ring And dont worry its not a spoilerAs I quoted in this part of the review Tolkien may nothing is evil in the beginning not even Sauron was evil in his own beginning butthere is one thing in the MiddleEarth that it was evil since its own beginningthe One RingThe One Ring was evil in its own beginningThe One Ring was in the hand of Sauron then it passed to Isildur a man but it was soon lost and ended in the hands of Dagol a hobbit to fall right away in the possession of Smagol another hobbit having it for so many time that Smagol lost his own identity turning to be Gollum scary nasty treacherous and dangerous but still a hobbit then enter Bilbo yet another hobbit and finally gets into the picture Frodo yes another hobbitDo you see the pattern Because to me it wasnt that hardHobbit hobbit hobbit hobbitIts said that people all kind of people Elves Dwarves Men etc are obsessed with the One RingBut to me its clear that the One Ring is obsessed with the HobbitsSauron may be the Lord of the Rings but it has been stated that the One Ring has a mindlike on its own Its not like a Green Lanterns Power Ring able to talk and having a computerlike library to access inside even the feature to fly on its own to search the next suitable user The One Ring cant talk cant move or fly on its own but still is a magic ring alright or alwrong since its unquestionable wicked hey No only Tolkien can invent words and its clear that its purpose is to bind all people into darkness into evilSauron may have plans for the One Ring but its likely that the One Ring has its own plans its own designs not to rebel not to stand against its master but to fulfill its basic purpose since it may notice a small flaw in Saurons plansSauron wants to turn into evil the whole MiddleEarths population Elves are wise and powerful but still they have already fell into darkness in some numbers no wonder why theyre starting an exodus from the MiddleEarth Dwarves are greedy and violent theyre easy targets for darkness Men Dont make me laugh We are the most susceptible species for darkness of all nothing to worry about for the One RingHowever Sauron didnt even know the existence for not saying clearly not knowing the location of the Shire Therefore its evident that the hobbits arent in the plans of Sauron You can say that its because he didnt know about them or simply because he didnt consider them worthy to send any troops thereBut the One Ring knows In some way it knows about the HobbitsAnd the One Ring has    purpose  The One Ring is thorough about its purpose It is obsessed about its one single purpose in the MiddleEarth It has to bind ALL people into darkness into evil Not matter how tactically valuable or how ridiculous irrelevant The One Ring isnt in position to question the one single purpose that it was imprinted downright on its metal its whole body its entire soul  You may think that the One Ring was lost that it was wandering but nothe One Ring was precisely where it wants to be It found the HobbitsYes the Hobbits in a quick glance they arent something to be worry about when youre planning to dominate MiddleEarth Clearly it was Saurons point of view You cant blame him I dont think any military leader in his position would consider relevant to invest time and effort with the ShireBUT the One Ring thinks otherwiseIf the other races have to fall into darkness into evil then the Hobbits must be as wellThe Shire is an oasis of peace of light of goodwill of laughing of dancing of enjoying the basic pleasures of a more simple lifeand the One Ring cant tolerate that Its revolted by the very existence of such a good place inhabited by such merry species Everybody everywhere and everything must fall into its dark bind into evilIf Hobbits fall into darkness into evil then and only then Saurons plans would be truly accomplished and the One Rings purpose fulfilled    I am not a rookie with The Lords of the Rings since I watched all the movies but certainly I knew that eventually I will read the books While I am aware of what would happen here and in the next books I still enjoyed plenty enough the reading since I was able to notice the little differences here and there between the original writing and the modern film adaptations Some time ago I read The Hobbit and now I have read the first book Fellowship of the Ring but an important thing to have in mind is that hardly its a first book per se but the first part of one single book titled The Lord of the Rings since I cant blame other readers if they werent satisfied with the development made in this first partCharacters took an eternity to begin a journey to take a decision to do anything The few action moments are overly seldom spread and too quick developed so you dont get a real sense of being reading something in the epic fantasy genre Even some scenes arent presented in real time but they are told after the things happened stealing almost all thrill from them Some random characters without any real utility in the story An overwhelming telling of the vast background history of the MiddleEarth And finally you wont get an ending here this isnt really a whole book but the first part of a novelSo if you can have all that in mind knowing that you will have to read other two parts to get the whole story and trusting that you will get ample amounts of actions later maybe just maybe you would be forgiving enough to enjoy the wonderful writing using words in such clever way along with the majesty of the expansion of such rich literary universeKeep up my fellow readers The journey is just beginning   "},

"text": "For countless millennia no man or beast has ever succeeded in breaching the stone gateway into Girdlegard Until now Abandoned as a child Tungdil the blacksmith is the only dwarf in a kingdom of men But when he is sent out into the world to deliver a message and reacquaint himself with his people the young foundling finds himself thrust into a battle for which he has not been trained Not only his own safety but the life of every man woman and child in Girdlegard depends upon his ability to embrace his heritage Although he has many unanswered questions Tungdil is certain of one thing no matter where he was raised he is a true dwarf And no one has ever questioned the courage of the Dwarves This book reminded me of a role playing game Character gets assigned quest and sets off  when character arrives at destination he finds out that the quest completion parameters have been amended and that he has to continue to new destination where more or less the same thing happens Along the way the character collects items and learns skills he also meets other characters with different skills and some of these join up with him creating a party In the end the items and characters come together neatly to tie up the main story arc Developer credits rollNow this isnt a criticism I happen to enjoy role playing games I also happen to at times indulge in some Warhammer Forgotten Realms or Dragonlance fiction which is just as well otherwise I probably wouldnt have finished The Dwarves Its pretty much the same thing really This is one of those Fantasy books with highly improbably scenarios and bizarrely fortunate read untouchable protagonists for the most part I also cant help but feel that some of the nuances have been lost in the translation the original is in German Some of the sentences just read a bit nonsensical and seemed slightly out of contextOkay now that Ive got all that off my chest This isnt a bad novel and I will certainly be checking out the rest of the series BUT despite the authors best intentions it doesnt break a whole of a lot of new ground There are some nice twists but it isnt enough to make the story great Its entertaining enough and I was reminded quite a lot of a Dragonlance novel I once read called Stormblade Fun   I could not take it any more I am taking some advice and I am not going to finish this book even though I REALLY tried I started this book in August and have taken breaks from it  or  times I wanted this book to be good but its way too simple The plot is very simple and predictable The characters are Tolken templates and are not very interesting At times it seemed the dialogue between the dwarven characters in this book came straight from yr old boys who were having a make a believe battle in their fort with pretend orcs This book maybe an International Bestseller but it feels like it was written by a highschooler   The best review I can give is that my  year old son spent his own money to buy the first three books in hard cover read them and encouraged his friends to read them I just had to read them myself and found myself enjoying them Let the author speak for himselfDeath came for the dwarf and tried to take him whereupon the warrior squared his shoulders dug his heels against the granite floor and told him to go Death turned around and left  Apologue from the southern provinces of SangprDwarves and mountains have one thing in common It takes an almighty hammer and a tremendous amount of persistence to overcome them Traditional saying from the Murk region northeast IdoslaneAt the battle of the Blacksaddle trolls were wailing orcs whimpering and our battlehardened warriors were close to despair but I never saw a dwarf lose heart  PaldurIl personal guard to Litasil of Alandur Lord of the ElvesEven the elves have taken notice   Once I managed to trudge through the first  or so pages which are a bit of a massive yawn things really started to pick up and I began to really enjoy the book The writing isnt particularly stellar but it flows nicely and its the characters that spurred me on to continue reading The core characters I really fell in love with It would be interesting to read it in its original german I am one of those people who cant help but think anything that is translated might lose a bit of its essence At times I find it difficult to keep characters names in order but I find that with most epic fantasy series however the world of the dwarves is constructed quite well Theres a lot of humour and warmth to these groundlings I find myself giggling manically especially when Boindil is fighting orcs Hes on sociopathic little comedic dwarf that one Its the characters that really hold this tale together    Once I read an article about classic fantasy cliches Classic fantasy books have adjectives ending in ling like halfling This is a book fool of lings it fits all fantasy cliches But after reading so many realistic and political intriguing fantasy books this book has its charms in simplicityFirst chapters i was wondering whether i stop it or not A simple story with ADD dwarves complete with character creation chapters and skill advancement pages I thought i was  all overAs the plot thickens so does the speed Slowly the characters become more real and intriguing A lot of battles take place The dwarves depicted gain depth but then again they are dwarves they have their funny moments As the author explains in acknowledgments section he never ventures far from the normal dwarflovingreaders expectationsThe climax is somewhat expected but enjoyableI dont know if ill read the second part The War of the Dwarves but it was a trouble free book that I read at ease   "},

"text": "Under the streets of London theres a place most people could never even dream of A city of monsters and saints murderers and angels knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracksRichard Mayhew a young businessman is going to find out more than enough about this other London A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre And a strange destiny awaits him down here beneath his native city Neverwhere I didnt enjoy this book as much as I should have I kept distracting myself with the thought Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans books Then I would have to tell myself to shut up because Im reading one right now and I can return to berating myself laterNeil Gaiman really understands fantasy He understands that it isnt elves dancing in a forest and drunk dwarves mining for gold with improbably well maintained beards No fantasy is a reflection of reality but fantastic It isnt an alternate reality but reality through the lens of imagination and possibly some mind altering substances Not only does he capture the essence of fantasy perfectly but he does so with the trickiness and charming language that seems to be uniquely in the realm of British humorists He rarely describes anything in a completely straightforward manner instead choosing to almost fool the reader into visualizing his delightful or when appropriate very undelightful characters and events I couldnt help but to be completely charmed by and immersed into London Below right up until the point when some jackass started to wonder Why the hell havent I read more of Neil Gaimans booksSo a few years later and a lot of people seem to like this review still Ive decided to abuse the popularity of this review to attempt to steer fans of Neverwhere towards a few other books that I think they will enjoy Despite the theme of the review being Read more Neil Gaiman the books listed below are actually by different authors since I think Ive already made it clear that you should read more Neil Gaiman So aside from all of those here are a few other recommendations Bridge of Birds by Barry Hughart  An epic hilarious mythological adventureWool by Hugh Howey  A pretty dark and serious tale of people living underground on a ruined world The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson  A globetrotting adventure set among a lovingly researched historical backdrop  Little Brother by Cory Doctorow  A nerd finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly being stalked by his own government and doesnt think its so cool   Neverwhere was my first real introduction to the world of urban fantasy  a clever take on Alice in Wonderland one can say set in the semimagical unsubtly dangerous and quite fantastically warped world of London BelowNeverwhere is one of my alltime favorite books It has just the right amount of wild imagination inexplicably somehow still grounded in firm reality a healthy dose of absurdity and strangeness remarkably colorful largerthanlife characters unforgettable setting that is more of a character than a simple backdrop and of course sufficient amount of lovely dry humor Besides there is that certain something in Neil Gaimans writing that keeps bringing me back to his works  that cleverness I guess that boldness in his approach to writing that apt descriptiveness that burns scenes into your mind without becoming boringly detailed or repetitive and the bit of mesmerizing darkness he harbors in all of his works regardless of the theme or target audienceIn Neverwhere Gaiman uses the old technique of taking a person belonging to the regular world and throwing them into the midst of a fantastical reality using the protagonist as our eyes into this world  think of Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz or its younger siblings like Mivilles Un Lun DunRichard Mayhew is a timid and perfectly average London guy who suffers from a noticeable lack of figurative backbone  and the only time in his life he does show some of that illfated backbone combined with some very real compassion he gets himself into trouble that is waaaay over his head Let Richard tell you about it himself  Unwittinly having thwarted an assassination attempt on a young girl named Door and having helped her because lets face it hes basically a decent guy Richard suddenly finds himself in the London Below  a place for those who no longer belong to the regular London Above a place for those who have slipped through the cracks of ordinary reality It is a place that exists outside of our conventions of time and space touching our reality but not quite overlapping itJust like London Above London Below is a melting pot  except for this one is for relics and discards and misfits of all kinds of times and legends and beliefs and tales It is a place for those who fell between the cracks  think of those you usually do not notice even if you walk past them on the street like the homeless for instance they are already invisible to us It is also a place for those who spent too much time in the company of the supernatural and for those who dont fit in our world You can view it as a colorful tapestry  or more aptly as a dirty filthy rag made of mismatched and threadbare bits and pieces that once were something grand and even now create a mesmerizing albeit puzzling effect through their sheer strangeness and unexpected combinationAnd it is a place that has teeth and is ready to bite It is harsh and cruel full of menacing dangers lurking around every corner Friends can quickly turn into foes and promising a favor is a serious thing that can get you far in this world It takes skill to survive hereAnd Richard is very much NOT prepared for thatLondon Below is a place populated with creatures that have enough color and flair to them to easily stand out against the drab background of life and their surroundings Of course Im talking about Marquis here the notsohonest and yet brave and loyal for a reasonable price of a favor Marquis de Carabas the guy who you would ultimately want covering your back in a sticky situation as long as you can overlook the fact that he may have had something to do with creating the said sticky situation in the first place  With characters like Marquis or the enigmatic singleminded Hunter or pretty much anyone Richard comes in contact with in this weird mixture of rooftops and sewers and underground tunnels London Below is a confusing blur to Richards tired and overwhelmed senses Some things dont make sense Others make way too much sense are way too literal Earls Court or Knightsbridge for instance He is so out of place here its almost painful to read as you wince and cringe at his pathetic attempts to clutch to what he continues to view as safety and sanity And no this sanity does not normally involve girls named Door or a charming scoundrel Marquis de Carabas or Angel Islington or outwordly hired thugs Croup and Vandemar or Rat Speakers or Beast of London or the real Old Bailey or the nonexistent British Museum underground station where Earls Court can get you if you so please   But eventually Richard may just may start discovering something about himself that is a bit more adjusted in the world that has slipped through the cracks than real London In other words Richard Mayhew just may have gone native Unlike Dorothy and her Toto he may not want to just live happily ever after in his version of KansasAfter all havent we all at some point asked a question about what is the meaning of all that we are doing Havent we always wondered whether there ay be something else we may be better suited to be and do Havent we wanted to escape somewhere well else Different Isnt that some of the reasons we wan t to immerse ourselves into worlds of fantasy at least for a short while  Usually however the point is to return home enriched by experiences of the outwordliness and of course gain some appreciation for the life we used to take for granted before Because of course no matter how much we want to we will never escape the real life Or can we After reading this book I know I would want to had I been in Richards place But I cannot and so I appreciate my mundane uneventful life  but what if I didnt have to Who knows   I first started reading this book and honestly wanted to just chuck it in the bin I said very mean things about the protagonist under my breathSurely I said a Protagonist means that they are pro and totally into furthering the story Surely Protagonist is the similar to Proactive and ProductiveI was wrong The word Protagonist in its basic form is not similar to proactive It simply from the Greek plays means the principle character or the first speaking characterHowever I maintain that the kind of protagonist that most people want to read about is one that actually bloody does somethingHistoryLanguage lesson overNeverwhere is a book that TRIES to be clever and magical In many senses it utterly manages to be magical and creative and fun It fails however to be clever There are so many lines in this book intending to be dry wit and just come off dry stupid Allow an exampleThere are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr Coup and Mr Vandemar apart first Mr Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr Croup second Mr Croup has eyes of a faded china blue while Mr Vandemars eyes are brown third while Mr Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens Mr Croup has no obvious jewellery fourth Mr Croup likes words while Mr Vandemar is always hungry Also they look nothing at all alike Oh I see what you did there Kat laughs slapping her knee with her hand in amusement No not really If hed left out these lame little lines I think I probably would have enjoyed this novel a whole lot moreJust about every other character in this story is awesome except for the protagonist Give me a story about Marquis de Carabas and I will read it in a second Honestly fantastic character right there Tell me I have to read another whiny missive about Richard Mayhew and I will likely stick hot pokers into my eyes firstI get it I really do Its a journey He has to LEARN and GROW and CHANGE But he takes a REALLY long time to do it and he only ever grows to be slightly less pansy soft and annoying The total character growth comes to equal someone who doesnt just sit idly by and let people take stuff from himLet me give you an example He met a girl who was unconscious in the streets and bleeding to death He takes her home This causes his fiancee to break up with him He then goes through a lengthy process to get the girl back where she came from Once he does this he then loses his job his apartment and all his money He then goes to find the girl for a an explanation and b help Without her help he will probably die as another side effect of having met her is that he has two psychopathic killers on his tail She simply apologizes and walks away abandoning him So what does he do Does he chase her down and gently remind her that she owes him a favor Does he barter and trade what he can whilst trying to lure the killers into a trap so that he can some how defend himself No I will now transcribe from the book EXACTLY what he doesRichard leaned against a wall and listened to their footsteps echoing away and to the rush of the water running past on its way to the pumping station of East London and the sewage works Shit he said And then to his surprise for the first time since his father died alone in the dark Richard Mayhew began to cry He decides to stay there and die Thats right folks He just stays there waiting to die BoofuckinghooYa know I dont accept this crap from a female character  nor do I accept it from a man How the hell am I suppose to sympathize with someone who so blithely lets everything he has slip through his fingers because he cant speak up and demand explanations or some kind of help This level of pitiful doesnt help the audience empathize  it makes them think your protagonist is an idiot The plot is pretty good  despite everything being painfully obvious and predictable at the end The world building is fantastic Its probably the best thing about this book Its really creative and fascinating and interestingOver all it was an alright read It wasnt great I labored through until the last half where it began to pick up and markedly improve Thus only three stars Had the first half been more like the last half then it would have earned four   Picture Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Really good books right Now imagine if someone took the first book and mad libbed characters settings monsters etc so that you were left with the exact same story except instead of travelling the galaxy with your crazy friend and the most powerful man in the universe you were travelling in haunted British sewers with a nerds wet dream of a Xena warrior princess rival and a Gothic princess who can unlock doors sigh I dont think there is much of a coincidence either because Gaiman wrote the Hitchhikers companion in the early s as well as conducted interviews with Adams while he was alive not to mention took writing tips from him The only saving grace for me with this book was the fact that there someone actually made a miniseries on the BBC of it that is actually so bad that it makes the book look half way decent Between all the cliche characters cheesy narration and formulaic plot its just not worth your money or a read especially when Hitch Hiker exists already Ive said it before stick to American Gods and The Sandman when it comes to Gaiman   There are two Londons Theres London Abovethats where you livedand then theres London Belowthe Undersideinhabited by the people who fell through the cracks in the world Now youre one of themWhat if there is a secret underworld hidden in the dark below the busy noisy streets of London What if Earls Court is truly the court of an earl and the name of Angel station derives from a real angel On a fortuitous night Richard Mayhew finds a mysterious young girl wounded in an alley and it is the first step on a journey to the world of NeverwhereNeil Gaiman is an author thats been on my list for a long time and I must say this was not anywhere near what I had expected His writing style is more flowery which translates to better in my head than I had feared and the premise and plot of at least this book was a lot less weird and more mainstream than I had thought As a whole that made me think of this as a somewhat remarkably wellwritten book with unremarkable characters storyline and settingAs an inhabitant of London albeit a temporary one this book of course came with an enormous appeal I decided I had to read it before I moved again and Im glad I did The fantastic fictionalisation of the Underground is both wonderful and enough to change my view of London The tube stations Earls Court Angel and many others now carry new meaningsIn the end Neverwhere is a very enjoyable but largely unimpressive book Not many people see this as a favourite among Gaimans works but its a good book that Id recommend to anyone who has been to London   "},

"text": "One boy One dragon A world of adventureWhen Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy perhaps it will buy his family meat for the winter But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling Eragon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itselfOvernight his simple life is shattered and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny magic and power With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no boundsCan Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands I cannot adequately express my complete and utter loathing for this book I was working at a library during the time that this book was being published and had access to a galley of the novel I did finish it but only so I could know entirely how much Christopher Paolini the supposed yearold authorgenius had plagiarized JRR Tolkiens Lord of The Rings trilogy If you are not familiar with the Inheritance books allow me to inform youLord of the Rings TrilogyEragon TrilogyLord of the Rings a main character AragornEragon main charactor EragonLord of the Rings Aragorns love interest is Arwen the daughter of an elf kingEragon

dungeonsEragon there is a big fight in the troll dungeonsI could continuesuffice it to say after reading Eragon I classified it as Lord of the Rings with a dragon This is definitely not worth anyones time unless you want to amuse yourself by noting how many similarities there are between the trilogiesAddendum WOW Thanks for all the comments This is by far my most popular review Im glad to know others share my feelings for this pitiful excuse of an imaginative novel Addendum  If you like so many others in the comments find fault with my apparent ignorance and wish to correct me regarding the fact that this series is not a trilogy please see comment  Addendum  I cant even I just cant Do you know how many people have commented on the fact that this isnt a trilogy since I added Addendum  SPECIFICALLY addressing that I dont even know how many because Ive lost count What does this teach us It teaches us that people dont read Let that sink in    Standard fantasy fare except that while most fantasy authors lift their plots only vaguely from a previous author Eragon is simply the plot of Star Wars with a Lord of the Rings paintjobPrincess flees trying to keep precious item out of the evil emperors hands Boy finds item Bad guys burn down his farm and kill his uncle Old mysterious man helps him and turns out to be part of a secret order of knights to which boys now evil father belonged Gives boy fathers sword and takes him eventually to princess then dies tragically Boy learns how to fly XWings er dragons and goes to take on his father and the evil emperor c c Paolini also resembles other fantasy authors by denying that he is a fantasy author instead imagining that he is a great literary talent In his own words In my writing I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaneys translation of BeowulfUnfortunately his control of language is more akin to a piece of Harry Potter fanfic There are some days that I wish my parents ran their own publishing company too However if such a boon would require me to write as obliviously as Paolini I would have to decline Yeah I know he was eighteen but so was Byron when he wrote Hours Of Idleness and Pope when he wrote his Essay on Criticism If Paolini doesnt hesitate to compare himself to what he sees as literary greats I certainly have no problem with letting my criticism fall with equal weight on his little bit of fluffI think the reason I keep returning to Pulp writers like Robert E Howard is that those authors just wanted to write exciting stories instead of the next literary event Authors who lack pretension often write very good stories because they arent forcing themselves to write overblown overlycomplex stories Many modern fantasy authors do the opposite they write redundant escapist yarns and then get upset that no one considers them to be literary greats yetThere is nothing new or interesting here for anyone who has read fantasy beforeits just a rehash of old cliches The writing pacing and characterization are substandard I wasnt surprised to find that a teen boy wrote this bookits exactly what I would expect a teenage fantasy fan to writeMy Fantasy Book Suggestions   Two or three years ago everywhere I went there was some display attempting to sell me Eragon by Christopher Paolini It was obviously a bad book without opening the cover the back cover carries a quote from the book and an endorsement by Anne McCaffrey and Im pretty sure I could get that woman to supply a blurb for a double mint wrapper to the effect of I couldnt put it down An author  to watch for The quote is Wind howled through the night carrying a scent that would change the world Please note the author has just claimed that the world is going to be changed by a smell Which would actually be an interesting book sadly not this one I know this because that quote is the first sentence of the book and what the author means is Wind howled through the night carrying a scent giving warning of the coming of persons who would set in motion events that would change the world I know it lacks a certain somethingBetter the eighty percent of the pit of voles but still undeserving of being publishedI do not blame Paolini for writing a bad book People write and sometimes they write badly But I do blame the editor and his publishing house This book is crap and it should have been obvious to anyone who read it The main characters most interesting bit of characterization and only vestige of personality is that he collects rocks and this is only mentioned in one paragraph Hes a transparent sue Everyone acts as if they have just acquired their motivations and history on a x card before walking on for their sceneThe plot is a clumsy clunker that is foreshadowed on page  He has never known his father and his mother refused to answer questions about him Do you think this will turn up again later His name is Eragon Like dragon but with an E An old man pops in to tell what in a better novel would be suspiciously appropriate myths and folktales every time Eragon needs to know what is going onDescriptive sections are often incomprehensible as for example His hand was numb his fingers paralysed Alarmed he watched as the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffuse white oval The only reason I know what the author is intending to say there is because I have read enough fantasy to recognize the Mystical MarkOur hero makes decisions that make no sense simply because they are necessary to move the plot forward Obstacles like hiding a dragon from those living in your house are hand waved away in two paragraphs Things that oughtnt be obstacles like buying groceries are just to build sympathy with the protagonist by inserting baseless discriminationWhy publish this Were they incapable of finding something more deserving Was this book even edited Is he someones nephew Publishing this book is an insult to readers and a disservice to writers everywhere including Mr Paolini Its like telling someone they look great when they have spinach in their teeth Dammit   Here is a short list of things I find more enjoyable than reading EragonWhy does this book read like it was written by a fantasyobsessed yearold Oh nevermind Is THAT why is has EVERY single one motheaten fantasy clich Its like Paolini actually in all seriousness used Diana Wynne Jones humorous The Tough Guide to Fantasyland as a real technical manual on how to create the Eragon universe And the proud parents of a budding new Tolkien instead of proudly allowing him to read it out loud at family gatherings decided to publish it and unleash it upon the worldLEFT  the ride that this story promises to take you on RIGHT  what you actually get The only way to actually enjoy  Lets have a roll call for the clichs shall we A mysterious talented orphanpoor farm boy Check Dragons Check Elves and dwarves Check Stew Check Ancient sword Check The weird apostropheridden names save the protagonists of course Check A quest Check Hot chick Damsel in distress Check And it goes on and on and on Wait you say maybe Paolini was deliberately paying homage to the traditions of the fantasy genre Fine I suppose that could explain some of it But still blindly and straightforwardly rehashing of the old tropes without adding much originality IS NOT OKAY okay I think that the writing is immature and betrays the authors young age and lack of experience Throughout the novel Paolini clumsily brings our attention to anything that he considers important to the story with constant reminders and bricksized hints Foreshadowing should be subtle but I dont think he quite grasps that concept The descriptions are trying too hard to be Tolkienlike but fail at this miserably His attempts at creating accents and dialects are pathetic There were quite a few instances when I had to shake my head muttering I dont think this word means what you think it does The prose is stilted and quite irritating while trying to be overly pretentious  OH I SEE The characters are flat and devoid of any believable personality with shallow and simplistic motivations that only exist to move the plot forward The interactions between them are farfetched and forced The protagonist Paolinis version of Luke Skywalker absolutely marvelous at so many cool things with minimal training every childs dream is there for the reader to selfinsert into the story The deuxexmachina bits replace so many actual solutions in this story that no amount of eyerolling would suffice And the plot holes  the story is so full of those theres barely any plot left at all As for the worldbuilding  well he stuffs it with every imaginable fantasy trope as I mentioned before Ughhhh And yet at the end nothing is memorableWhy did I read it if I hated it you ask Simple answer  I was bored and this was the only book within reach I would NOT recommend it to those who are familiar with the fantasy genre Actually scratch that  I would not recommend it to anyone  star   I LOVE the Inheritance books I had never heard of Christopher Paolini before and was walking through Barnes and Noble when I saw this book on the end display What caught my eye was the dragon on the front cover I love dragons and my artistic eye was captivated by the artwork This is a great fictionadventurefantasy novel Anyone who is a Lord of the Rings would truly have an appreciation for this book I was hooked from the moment I picked up this book and began reading The story begins with a young farm boy named Eragon from a small village While hunting in the wilderness in search of food for their family Eragon comes across a rare stone which is later revealed to be a dragon egg He takes it home with him and to his suprise the egg hatches and out comes Saphira The two are instantly connected as a Dragon and Rider making them inseparable Once Saphira is big enough to fly they set out to seek revenge for the death of Eragons uncle who was murdered This is just the begining of their journey throughout the land battling mysterious evil forces A very good book to cuddle up with on a cool fall day or during the winter when you need a good adventure to bring you out of being stuck in your house   "},

"text": "They say Aslan is on the move Perhaps he has already landed whispered the Beaver Edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror Peter felt brave and adventurous Susan felt as if some delightful strain of music had just floated by And Lucy got that feeling when you realize its the beginning of summer So deep in the bewitched land of Narnia the adventure beginsThey opened a door and entered a worldNarniathe land beyond the wardrobe the secret country known only to Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy Lucy is the first to stumble through the back of the enormous wardrobe in the professors mysterious old country house discovering the magic world beyond At first no one believes her But soon Edmund Peter and Susan too discover the magic and meet Aslan the Great Lion for themselves And in the blink of an eye they are changed forever This is the first book where I chronicled my thoughts as I read through it with my son I dont know how easy it is for yall to access the record of those here on Goodreads but if youre looking for a detailed account of my thoughts on the book you can look thereIll say this Ive read a lot of books to my little boy these last couple years and I can honestly say that This book is among the best Good tight writing good description Good action Also theres not a lot of dead space or trashy empty dialogue that just seems to be there to take up space Thats become a particular peeve lately And when youre reading a book aloud it becomes really obvious The British slang will be a stumbling block to some But its not too bad And there were a few slight pieces of sexism that I ignored skipped over or reworded on the fly But honestly this book was written  years ago and you need to cut it a little slack because of that And in my opinion it only needs a little slack Truth be told Ive read books written this year that have ten times the sexism this one does Also Id like to make it clear that this is the FIRST book of the Narnia Chronicles This is where you start the series Im sorry if you read them in the wrong order but if you did its better than you admit it now come to grips and move on with your life knowing the truth   My greatest disappointment in The Screwtape Letters was that Lewis was not able to demonstrate what made his good people good or his bad people bad The closest he got to defining goodness was that you could tell the good people from the vague aura of light that surrounded themand which even shone in their cat In this book the cat is much biggerAslan had no character he was just a big dull standin Lewis often tells us how great he is but never demonstrates what it is that makes him great or impressive Sure he helps the kids but all that makes him is a plot facilitator He also has his big Jesus moment but that has the same problem as the original if he already knows that there will be no lasting negative outcome how much of a sacrifice is it reallyBut then Aslan isnt based on the original figcursing churchrejecting rebel Jesus but the whitewashed version Like Mickey Mouse Jesus started out as an oddball troublemaker with his fair share of personality but becoming the smiling face of a multinational organization bent on world domination takes a lot out of a mascot whether your magic castle is in California or RomeSuch a visible figure must become universally appealing universally friendly and loving lest some subset of followers feel left out And its this Buddy Christ tradition from which Aslan springs Devoid of insight wisdom or charm Aslan is just here to do all the things that our protagonists cant doThis also beggars the question why didnt Aslan just take care of all this stuff long before the kids arrived Why did all the animals and fairies and giants have to suffer the pain of an endless winter Were never given any good reason Aslan had to wait for the kidssince in the end he does it all on his own anyways Sure Lewis mentions something vague about a prophecy but in fantasy prophecy is always a bandaid authors stick over their plot holes Uh the shlubby nobody is a hero because the prophecy says he ishe defeats the ultimate evil because the prophecy says he can The only thing the kids do is help run the battle but this is only necessary because Aslan is absent and hes only absent because the kids screwed up meaning the entire thing would have gone off without a hitch if they had never showed up in the first placeIn that regard I have to say Lewis did an excellent job boiling down Christianity into a fable and leaving the problem of evil completely intact Some readers suggest that Aslan lets the queen take over to teach the kids a lesson but is it really worthwhile to let all the inhabitants of a kingdom suffer a century of misery just to teach a few kids about the true meaning of friendshipThe villain is just as poorlyconstructed and seems less concerned with defeating her enemies than with being pointlessly capricious She manages to trick one of the children but instead of taking advantage of this fact she immediately makes it clear that she tricked him I mean how did someone that incompetent take over in the first placeSelectively stupid characters are silly and convenient especially as villains because this completely undermines their role as foil It is impressive when characters overcome challenges but not when challenges simply crumble before them The children are lucky the Queen was more of a fartstealing Old Nick than a Miltonian Satan otherwise they never would have stood a chanceIt is interesting to look at how many Christian authors have tried to reconcile their faith with complex fairy mythologies not that Christianity doesnt have its own magical fairy tales but these other traditions are not exactly compatible Dante has Virgil lead him through hell the Buddha was made into a saint holidays were given new meanings even if they often kept old symbols and names and magical monsters were also given a place in the new faithIn the Middle Ages monks compiled Bestiaries which described the roles of dragons unicorns and real animals in Christian synbolism there were even centuryspanning debates about whether dogheaded men were descended from Adam These books were rarely accurate but allowed Christian theology to adopt many stories and superstitions from earlier periods for instance the connection between unicorns and virginity or the belief that pelicans fed their own blood to their young in imitation of communionSo Lewis attempt to take myth and adapt it to a Christian cosmology is hardly newthere is a long and storied tradition explored throughout the Chivalric period and recognizable today in books like The Once and Future King but Lewis doesnt do a very good job of reconciling these disparate mythologiesLike most Protestants Lewis religion was a modern onenot magical and mystical but reasonable and utilitarian He did not draw on the elaborate convoluted apocrypha of hallucinatory monsters and miracles that mystics obsess over instead he made a small sane reasonable magical worldwhich rather defeats the point It is unfortunate that many of todays readers think of Lewis writings as defining English fairy tales since his late additions to the genre are not original nor are they particularly wellexecuted examplesMany authors have come to the genre with much more imagination a deeper sense of wonder and a more farreaching exploration of magic We have examples from Kipling Lewis Carroll Dunsany Eddison Morris and even modern updates by Gaiman and Clarke Lewis like Tolkien may be a wellknown example but both are rather shortsighted and neither one achieves as much as the many talented authors who came beforeIm not saying Lewis is bad merely that he is unremarkable and is hardly preeminent in fantasy or even in childrens fantasy However I do think his fundamental message is a bad one even if he didnt realize he was creating it In all his worlds all his stories he takes the sorts of people he dislikes defines them as evil then sets himself apart from them There is no attempt to comprehend or to come to mutual understanding I cannot respect a book which encourages people to vilify what they dont understand and to call isolation righteous If any worldview deserves the epithet of evil it is the sort of willful prideful selfindulgent ignorance Lewis displaysMy List of Suggested Fantasy Books   I loved this bookIt was first read to me in th grade We would all come in from lunch and our teacher would read to us for about  minutes before we would start class I remember this book because it wasnt read to us by Mrs Graham but instead it would be read by Mr Goodwin her longhaired bearded Birkenstock wearing teachers aid  Over the next few weeks we were enthralled by this story we couldnt wait for lunch period to be over so we could hear what was happening in this magic kingdom called Narnia From the begining we all identified with Lucy and her siblings How was it possible that an English girl could transport herself to another place simply by hiding in a wardrobe And once through the wardrobe there was this wonderful and friendly creature called a faun Mr Tumnus All this in only the first chapter As the chapters progressed we got to know more about the siblings and the other creatures who inhabit Narnia Some people critisize CS Lewis for using too much Christian symbolism but I was in th grade and to me this was the most wonderful and exciting book ever written for children  When Mr Goodwin finished the book I instantly went to the library so I could read it myself I was very proud this was the first book I read without pictures To my joy I discovered there were other books about Narnia and I eventually read all of them too Evenutually I discovered other wonderful places in other books and I continue to look for them today I will always be grateful to Mr Goodwin he started off by telling me about Narnia but in the end he introduced me to so much more through my on going love of books Thank you Mr Goodwin for everything   A Defence of CS Lewisor a brief attempt at suchSome thoughts recently crossed my mind no doubt on their way downtown to relax in regards to arguments one could offer as a defence of the Christian side of this novel The main arguments against this novel as a Christian allegory that I have heard are Aslan is not a strong Christfigure That CS Lewis preaches a black and white morality So Im going to roughly address them from my perspective and hope it encourages some discussion I will agree that Aslan is not a strong Christfigure Firstly for Aslan to really represent Christ he would have to be true to the gospel story In other words he would have to be god made into man come to die for all mankind However as he only dies for the one traitor again its not sticking true to the Biblical gospel that all have sinned and that Christ was needed as a sacrifice for that sin If you take things too literally here CS Lewis novel doesnt make much that much sense theologically as a result Ill explain where I amwas going with that in a moment I debate that CS Lewis preaches in his novel Occasionally he can be a touch patronising but compared to many authors he rarely slips into such condescension As for his morality I think you must understand it from the perspective of Christianity Christianity is about black and white morality essentially good versus evil light vs dark and truth vs lies etc It is also very grey in that Christianity is about life and the fact that no one is perfect that everyone fits into that moral grey area Of course I explain roughly and inadequatelyUltimately I see that there is room to argue that CS Lewis does a poor job of writing an allegorical novel However I see it as a very subtle novel that unlike others for instance The Alchemist does not build its story around expressing an ideology but rather incorporates an ideology into its storytelling I think that if one wants to criticise this novel it should be for not properly showing the gospel rather than for preaching I know that I and many others enjoyed the story first before seeing the connection between it and the Biblical tales I enjoyed it even more afterwards so then again I could be a tad biasedOriginal ReviewTo begin I must note that I grant this such a high rating due to the impact it had on my life It to me is one novel that were I to pick the one novel that forged a love of books for me it would be The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Why Because I can remember back about twelve years ago when I was homeschooled by my mother as a five year old We wandered down during winter into the warm back room and she read the first Narnia book to us The image of a red faun carrying parcels as he passed a growing lamppost would stick with me from that moment as it stuck with CS Lewis As I learned to read the Narnia books were the first novels I sunk my growing reading teeth into And to this day I have read and re read the novels back to front and maybe front to backThe Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a novel written for both children and adults It contains highly allegorical elements as CSLewis was a wellknown apologetics writer However he wrote that he did not write his novel as a pure allegory but as a story And that is what The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a story to be enjoyed by everyone And although written in simple language the reader can quickly concisely and easily imagine the world without the clumsy constraints of overused words I personally cannot imagine a world without these novelsAdditional thoughts Just a question at last And one with a highly philosophical twist to it Why is it that people so readily condemn those books which are considered as moral tales Youd think we could do with more morality in such a twisted and confused world regardless of accepting the belief systems  I have heard many people describe the entire series as silly and far too preachy I do not see it that way at all Trust me if CSLewis wanted to be preachy he would have written a lot more philosophy and less story Yes I can see how some would call this silly but then I argue that they are missing the point Its a fairytale type fantasy intended mainly for children and for those children again as adults or for their parents perhaps But I argue that as Lewis only wrote this story based on the story of the crucifixion in many ways that it was not intended as a preachy book My question is that why is it that if I were to base a story along what some call the Christian myth it is claimed as preaching while as if I were to base it on any other mythology or story it would be deemed as merely copying the themes of another mythology Is this yet another example of doublethinkSee  yes go and read it  youll get what I mean   I just reread this book and got so much more out of it than the first time The symbolism  parallels to basic Christianity stuck out turkish delight is our human nature prone to addiction selfishness and wrongdoingPeter said about Edmund We should go after him After all he is our brother Even though he had just betrayed them and was causing grief they didnt mistreat or disown him The very mention of Aslans name caused certain positive feelings to come over them all they didnt know why But it made Edmund feel guiltyAfter Ed was returned and his siblings saw him for the first time Aslan said Here is your brother and theres no need to talk about whats in the past They forgave their brother Aslan neither excused him nor condemned himThey all knew better than to go into a wardrobe  shut the door as the book mentions a whole bunch of times We regularly do things when we know betterThe professor makes them think and questions their disbelief in Lucys story This is something the movie totally leaves out Who would you usually believe Lucy or Edmund etc Edmund shows the worst side of human nature to betray  let others downI love that Father Christmas comes giving gifts that represent the gifts  talents we each have to help others with and to overcome evil withTheres more but I have to go Loved the book And the movie   "},

"text": "Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy He lives with his Uncle Vernon Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley who are mean to him and make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs Dudley however has two bedrooms one to sleep in and one for all his toys and games Then Harry starts receiving mysterious letters and his life is changed forever He is whisked away by a beetleeyed giant of a man and enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry The reason Harry Potter is a wizard The first book in the Harry Potter series makes the perfect introduction to the world of Hogwarts Im going to keep this brief since there isnt much to say that hasnt already been said clears throatI think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldnt imagine myself enjoying reading about an elevenyearold boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste I was wrong of courseI can honestly say that I loved every minute of this Its a spectacular little romp with funny courageous and endearing characters that you cant help but loveIt has talking chess pieces singing hats a giant threeheaded dog named Fluffy a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish a master wizard thats just a little bit crazy mail carrier owls goblins running a bank unicorns centaurs trolls    and probably much more that Im forgetting And then theres the lead characters Hermione the young scholar who starts out prim and uptight but soon becomes a true friend Ron the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it and then theres Harry the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero Harry is kind to those that deserve it fearless when it counts the most and wonderfully intelligent Whats not to love In regards to the ending view spoilerI feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel but I didnt suspect Quirrell a bit If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape I obviously missed them FAVORITE QUOTE But from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themNow if youll excuse me Im off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsMy reviews of other titles in this seriesHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secretsbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr   My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight However this is stupid as the two are incomparable Honestly its not even worth discussing Its not just that Twilight doesnt come close it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works Its peerless To quote Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction It aint the same fuckin ballpark it aint the same league it aint even the same fuckin sport There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze and you can see that below in what was my original review It is a testament to the power of this series that while various other franchises Twilight Hunger Games have surged into popularity and then faded Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have Time has not dimmed thatI will one day write an essay about what these books mean to me Eternal this is the one that started it all Original review circa  A note in regard to the ongoing Potter vs Twilight debate Go ahed tell me Twilight is better Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort That the Cullens are a better family than the Weaslys That Edward is cooler than Harry and Bella is smarter than Hermione Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than JK Rowling Go ahead I dare you Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over are utterly stupid Quite franklythis book is amazing    Rereading for the rd time for the group readOnce upon a time there was a th grader named Khanh who didnt get along with people very well She wasnt an outcast in school and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughtsLunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating but to sitting in the library browsing through booksNot to worry she got her nutrition in th period in the form of a giant inch MM studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids andor a package of Reeses Pieces Ah the effortless metabolism of youthOne day there were shiny new books on her school librarys New Releases shelf Harry Potter books  through  She had heard of the books before of course since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list but she had always avoided them thinking of them as childrens novelsAt the grand age of  surely she was too old for a little kids fantasy novel She had read the Outlander series earlier that year after all And it had sex in it SEX She didnt really quite understand everything in the book but the point is she had read them Surely at  Khanh was ready for more mature novelsAnd that did not include Harry Potter Harry Potter is  Khanh is  There is a vast difference in their ages Khanh was a teenager dammitBut the Harry Potter books were new Brand new They were shiny they had never been touched by another reader And Khanh was temptedShe picked up the first book in the series Harry Potter and the Sorcerers StoneThe endOr rather the beginning   Review for Illustrated EditionPerfect Duh  ReRead in December  for Harry Christmas To YouOH LORDY Every time I read this book it brings back so many memories and also gets me excited to read the rest of the series again as well because there is so much foreshadowing For exampleSirius Black is casually mentioned in the first chapterMrs Figg is talked about a bit as she looks after Harry from time to time or all the time ayyyyit always cracks me up when Hagrid says youd have to be mad to try and rob Gringotts Damn crazy kidsAlso here was a line in Dumbledores chocolate frog card bio that said AND I QUOTE Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling HAHAHAHA WHAT EVEN NOW IM IMAGINING HIM BOWLING DRAMATICALLY TO CHAMBER MUSICRowling is the queen forever and alwaysReRead in July GINNYS FANGIRLING IN THIS BOOK IS JUST TOO GOODAlso the Dursleys arent as bad as people think they are because after all they DID pick Harry up at the end of the year rather than just abandoning him So THATS worth somethingmmmm this book smells so good Its good to be back   How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with thisI have to get this right As of this writing I have  Goodreads friends   of them have read J K Rowlings Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone Out of those who read this   rated this with  stars  of them with  stars All the others gave  or  Only  rated this with  star One of them admitted not being able to finish it She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety But she is my friend and it is her right so why questionWhen the book came out in  I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside I read only those books that my brother told me to read He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype However when Warner Bros released the film adaptation in  my daughter was  years old and I thought that since there was too much hype the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever fatherdaughter movie date I was wrong She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the lifesize human chess game in that scene when Ron was sacrificed We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it   My daughter is now  going  She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter However I am now a bookworm and the other week I was with my  Goodreads friends and  of them raved two of them again about Harry Potter books Oh well firsttime fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters Book  is included in  Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read So the following day I bought my copyAfter  years of the books existence and me ignoring it did I finally make a good decision of reading it Are all of those  friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this  stars Most of them did not bother writing a review Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review longThese are what some of them say  For an eloquent reviewer she must have been too happy to express herself   Yes I agree about the story being great and J K Rowling being creative   Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though   Another one of my favorite reviewers That seems to have nailed this Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery That should be it The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs pigs ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points money for our familyOh well the Bible says that sorcery is Satans work The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school BlasphemyJust kidding This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it I was just kidding To be frank I tried hard not to like this I thought that giving this a  or  will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are up to now ignoring this book I told you so Why waste your time  However unless you are a grumpy old manwoman there is nothing not to like about this book I maybe too old for it but hey talent is talent and J K Rowling has itMy  friends are indeed right   "}]
