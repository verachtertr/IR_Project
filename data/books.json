that we do Though she cant help but cover some familiar territory her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincolns leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation Goodwin makes the case for Lincolns political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in  William H Seward Salmon P Chase and Edward Bates These men all accomplished nationally known and presidential originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administrationSeward as secretary of state Chase as secretary of the treasury and Bates as attorney generalhe ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well How he soothed egos turned rivals into allies and dealt with many challenges to his leadership all for the sake of the greater good is largely what Goodwins fine book is about Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people she argues he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods  Ten years in the making this engaging work reveals why Lincolns road to success was longer more tortuous and far less likely than the other men and why when opportunity beckoned Lincoln was the best prepared to answer the call This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward Chase and Bates Lincoln may have been the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesnt just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis Here Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book four of whom contended for the  Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincolns cabinet Edwin M StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of  Unimaginable as it might seem after Stantons demeaning behavior Lincoln offered him the most powerful civilian post within his giftthe post of secretary of warat their next encounter six years later On his first day in office as Simon Camerons replacement the energetic hardworking Stanton instituted an entirely new regime in the War Department After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed Lincolns choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta humiliation or bitterness As for Stanton despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a long armed Ape he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the presidents death Salmon P ChaseChase an Ohioan had been both senator and governor had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself As a result he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he rather than Lincoln would be the Republican nominee in  and he steadfastly worked to that end The president put up with Chases machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury Eventually however Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes When Lincoln stepped in Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in  he seemed to have come from nowherea backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the US Senate Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance to his moderate position on slavery and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois But Lincolns triumph particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals owed much to a remarkable unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat That Lincoln after winning the presidency made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family the cabinet was evidence of an uncanny selfconfidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness William H Seward A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington Seward was certain he was going to receive his partys nomination for president in  The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do Seward would become his closest friend advisor and ally in the administration More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincolns peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought Batess ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family and he withdrew from public life in the late s For the next  years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined However in early  with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him he decided to try for the highest office in the land After losing to Lincoln he vowed in his diary to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered but with the country in trouble and danger he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a wellmeaning but incompetent administrator he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader very near being a perfect man"},

{"title": "Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln",

"text": "The life and times of Abraham Lincoln have been analyzed and dissected in countless books Do we need another Lincoln biography In Team of Rivals esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do Though she cant help but cover some familiar territory her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincolns leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation Goodwin makes the case for Lincolns political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in  William H Seward Salmon P Chase and Edward Bates These men all accomplished nationally known and presidential originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administrationSeward as secretary of state Chase as secretary of the treasury and Bates as attorney generalhe ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well How he soothed egos turned rivals into allies and dealt with many challenges to his leadership all for the sake of the greater good is largely what Goodwins fine book is about Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people she argues he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods  Ten years in the making this engaging work reveals why Lincolns road to success was longer more tortuous and far less likely than the other men and why when opportunity beckoned Lincoln was the best prepared to answer the call This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward Chase and Bates Lincoln may have been the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesnt just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis Here Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book four of whom contended for the  Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincolns cabinet Edwin M StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of  Unimaginable as it might seem after Stantons demeaning behavior Lincoln offered him the most powerful civilian post within his giftthe post of secretary of warat their next encounter six years later On his first day in office as Simon Camerons replacement the energetic hardworking Stanton instituted an entirely new regime in the War Department After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed Lincolns choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta humiliation or bitterness As for Stanton despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a long armed Ape he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the presidents death Salmon P ChaseChase an Ohioan had been both senator and governor had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself As a result he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he rather than Lincoln would be the Republican nominee in  and he steadfastly worked to that end The president put up with Chases machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury Eventually however Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes When Lincoln stepped in Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in  he seemed to have come from nowherea backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the US Senate Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance to his moderate position on slavery and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois But Lincolns triumph particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals owed much to a remarkable unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat That Lincoln after winning the presidency made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family the cabinet was evidence of an uncanny selfconfidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness William H Seward A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington Seward was certain he was going to receive his partys nomination for president in  The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do Seward would become his closest friend advisor and ally in the administration More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincolns peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought Batess ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family and he withdrew from public life in the late s For the next  years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined However in early  with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him he decided to try for the highest office in the land After losing to Lincoln he vowed in his diary to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered but with the country in trouble and danger he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a wellmeaning but incompetent administrator he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader very near being a perfect man"},

"text": "Sam Harris first book The End of Faith ignited a worldwide debate about the validity of religion In the aftermath Harris discovered that most people  from religious fundamentalists to nonbelieving scientists  agree on one point science has nothing to say on the subject of human values Indeed our failure to address questions of meaning and morality through science has now become the most common justification for religious faith It is also the primary reason why so many secularists and religious moderates feel obligated to respect the hardened superstitions of their more devout neighborsIn this explosive new book Sam Harris tears down the wall between scientific facts and human values arguing that most people are simply mistaken about the relationship between morality and the rest of human knowledge Harris urges us to think about morality in terms of human and animal wellbeing viewing the experiences of conscious creatures as peaks and valleys on a moral landscape Because there are definite facts to be known about where we fall on this landscape Harris foresees a time when science will no longer limit itself to merely describing what people do in the name of morality in principle science should be able to tell us what we ought to do to live the best lives possibleBringing a fresh perspective to ageold questions of right and wrong and good and evil Harris demonstrates that we already know enough about the human brain and its relationship to events in the world to say that there are right and wrong answers to the most pressing questions of human life Because such answers exist moral relativism is simply false  and comes at increasing cost to humanity And the intrusions of religion into the sphere of human values can be finally repelled for just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim algebra there can be no Christian or Muslim moralityUsing his expertise in philosophy and neuroscience along with his experience on the front lines of our culture wars Harris delivers a gamechanging book about the future of science and about the real basis of human cooperation"},
